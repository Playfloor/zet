# I Need Committed Moderators During Boost

The more I go through the outline for the upcoming 2022 boost the more I
realize I won't be able to use the loose format of talking to the chat
during more of the sessions. I must stay on topic and focused in order
to hit the maximum time allotments for everything. This means that I
desperately need really good moderators that know the material to some
degree who are live with me in the chat and can take all the questions
