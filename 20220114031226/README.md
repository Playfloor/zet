# Learning Lab: Do not Use Vagrant

What started as optimistic dive into learning about Vagrant became one
disappointment after another ultimately leading to the conclusion that
Vagrant is absolute crap that I will *never* touch again and frankly
just needs to die and get out of the way for better technologies (i.e.
Ansible, Terraform).

1. Dares to fuck with my `.bashrc` without asking for completion
1. All in ancient Ruby (forced to use Ruby configuration files)
1. 2017 critical bug with `libvirt` still unresolved
1. Very little activity on the project in general
1. Feels like only still alive because of legacy requirements
