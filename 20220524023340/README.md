# So Sick of Debating Morons on Twitter

I gave in to an indulgent tweet responding to something saying how
amazing Arch was by saying "Good luck using it at 99% of the enterprises
out there that do not allow Arch (and the shitty AUR)" and one idiot
responded that he would "love to see my sources on that."  That is the
definition of a moron. Any Linux user who has worked professionally for
more than five years will immediately be able to tell you that any
enterprise "that matters" (which I had to add later) does not allow Arch
and never will. Don't get mad, get busy.
