# Beginner Boost Content Organization

Let's go over how the Beginner Boost content is organized.

There is no Beginner Boost book. Books cannot fully cover the organic,
multi-path nature of real learning. They're too linear. So this Boost is
organized to allow you to focus and choose what to work on one step (or
***room***) at a time. I call this a Multi-User Dungeon for Learning, or
***MUDL***. You don't get progress from one room until you've completed
it (and survived). And when you do, there are multiple paths to choose.

The word ***room*** and acronym ***MUDL*** in that last paragraph are
stylized to indicate a ***term*** that you should learn and memorize.
Such terms are only highlighted the first time they appear in any room.
Usually term definitions have their own room listed in the *Next*
***block***. We'll get to blocks in a moment.

A ***block*** is just a grouping of text. It's a common formatting term.
The content for each room is organized into the following blocks:

* Title
* Objectives
* Body
* Related
* Next
* Tags

You'll learn more about them in a moment. Now you have a choice to make.
What should you learn about next?

1. "I need to know more about you before I continue?"
1. "I want to learn what the Beginner Boost is and why you made it?"
1. "I want to learn more about *MUDL* pedagogy?"
1. "I want to learn more about *rooms* and *blocks*?"
1. "I want to know if I'm ready to do the Boost?"
1. "I want to get started with first main Boost room?"

To follow one of these paths find the one that matches in the
*Next* block below.
