# Boost Badge Levels

While working through the Boost Badge idea it has become clear that
there are several levels of depth to any specific badge. The Scouting
program always struggled with establishing the proper level of depth. We
can learn from that mistake and build levels into the Boost Badge system
from the beginning. The question is how many levels? Five? Too many, and
things get crazy. (/me looks up how many Dagon recipes can be bought).

The idea is that only level one would ever be mandatory to achieve any
other rank since the Beginner Boost program is designed to give people a
sampling --- above all --- of the knowledge and skills involved. I'm
picking levels that would read well if attached to any Boost Badge name
(ex: Bash I, Basics):

1. Basics (conversant, has sampled and mastered something minimal)
1. Essentials (working knowledge, just enough to explore and be dangerous) 
1. Proficiency (full professional proficiency, could be paid for)
1. Excellence (beyond proficiency, innovative application of)
1. Mastery (domain leader, able to instruct and expound about)

Each level could have a built in title that depends on the specific badge.
Let's look at something like bash:

1. Bash User (can use the command line, history, tab completion)
1. Bash Coder (write simple scripts and own `bashrc` config)
1. Bash Programmer (can do anything in man page for an employer)
1. Bash Developer (designs complex applications and integrations)
1. Bash Master (could write book involving multiple projects)

Or, in Star Wars Jedi ranks:

1. Youngling
1. Padawan
1. Knight
1. Master
1. Councilor

Or, in hacker lingo:

1. `n00b`
1. `kiddy`
1. `h@xx0r`
1. `1337`
1. `0g`

Note that the knowledge and experience level moves up on a rather
exponential curve. Very few people will actually to the work required to
attain level five, or even four. Gaining *proficiency* is hard enough.
This allows to a certain degree of meritocitous distinction for the few
who do go for levels four and five. Most will be satisfied with level
two and a few level threes as well. The point is, there's room for
growth for everyone. The content for levels one, two, and three has the
highest priority.
