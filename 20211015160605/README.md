# Cloud-Native and Kubernetes Colearning, Oct 15, 2021

* CNCF added Kubernetes Cloud-Native Associate
* Dove in a bit into CNI providers (Calico)
* Attempt to bootstrap a cluster with nothing but Docker
* Followed steps of "Kubernetes the Hard Way"

Stuff I'd do differently than "Kubernetes the Hard Way":

* Not pay \$5/day for GCP (use Kind instead)
* Not use `tmux` synchronized panes (who actually does that?)
* Not depend on Cloudflare
* Not ever use `wget` (use `curl` instead, *always*)
* More like irrelevant-complete-waste-of-time-way
* "Compute instances" are just virtual machines
