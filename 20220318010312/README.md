# JSON5 is a Fucking Horrible Idea

The people that conceived of JSON5 have no fucking clue how JSON should
be used and how it should be used and specified. Just look at the other
"projects" created by its creator. They speak for themselves. There's a
very important reason Crockford left out the things he did. But the
JSON5 proponents really just don't get it. I hope JSON5 dies the
horrible death it deserves. Putting your name anywhere near that
project just proves how fucking uninformed and incompetent you are.

Thank God people who matter are moving to Protobuf over JSON anyway (and
will even more now that Go 1.18 is out.
