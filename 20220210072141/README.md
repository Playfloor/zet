# Boost Will Focus on VirtualBox Kali *and* Rocky

After a lot of reflection and experimentation I strongly feel that the
best focus for the Boost is on *all* major operating systems, that the
primary purpose of the Boost should, in fact, be exactly that. This
includes knowing how to install and run a GUI virtual machine (Kali) as
well as a no-GUI server virtual machine (Rocky). This will not only give
everyone a taste of both, but introduce the reason why learning `apt`
and `yum` is important (and why Arch is completely irrelevant for modern
work).

While I plan on mentioning VMware Workstation Pro, I've decided to use
VirtualBox for the boost because it works enough and is free. It also
has a much more powerful command line and has good support from
`libvirt` (which I eventually want use for `fluff`). For Mac M1 users
I'll just tell them that VMware Fusion does what VirtualBox does not
(nor has any plans of ever doing).
