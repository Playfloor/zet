# Learning to Install VMWare Harbor Locally

* Two installation methods: 1) Installer 2) Helm
* Installer has critical dependency on docker-compose for installation
* Seems that most use Helm for install
* Roadmap of HA dependencies seems to be clear:
  * Istio
  * PostgreSQL
  * Redis
* Decided to go with hardware lab setup first
