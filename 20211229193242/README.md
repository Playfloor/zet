# Coffee in Bed Ends Horribly

I had a late night (mostly because of drinking Brandy and not being able
to sleep) so when my wife brought be coffee in bed I really appreciated
it. It's been a while. Then I fell back asleep and woke in screams as I
spilled the scalding hot fresh coffee all over my armpit while laying
down. What's worse is that because I started Yoga again yesterday my
muscles were sore and my right shin locked in a cramp and would not stop
from the shock. So I was getting scalded and trying to get the cramp to
stop at the same time. I was pretty loud. It woke my step son who was
trying to figure out what was going on, even my wife couldn't figure it
out. She just saw me dancing around weird and making noises. My
tee-shirt was black and no one could even see it. 

Now even putting my arm down a slight bit causes all that burned flesh
to touch itself. I have to laugh now, at least I can, it wasn't funny
when it happened, like something out of Home Alone. I guess the Universe
must have thought I was a "filthy animal" for some reason. I suppose I
am.
