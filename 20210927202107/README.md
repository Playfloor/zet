# Boost Badges: Level One, Basics

Level one is one where the learner get's an initial introduction, often
guided, to the idea or skill, just enough experience and knowledge to
help the person make a decision about whether to pursue further learning
in that area.

For example, the `nano` editor is not recommended, but one might never
understand why unless they had a *basic* understanding of it, unless
they had tried it. For some there might be a compelling reason to pursue
learning `nano` further, for most not. You could make the same example
with something from the non-tech world, like *Basket Weaving* or
*Pottery*. Dismissing something you haven't even tried is usually a bad
idea. There's no shame in getting the Nano Boost Badge, it means you can
debate about its value more responsibility having tried it despite
everyone's recommendation against it. Same for Emacs, or VSCode.
