# Boost Badges: Level One, Essentials

The first level that became immediately obvious is ***Essentials***.
This is the default for the Scouting program.

I've had an "Essentials" course for a long time at SKILSTAK, but the
term will be used to identify the scope and depth of the Beginner Boost
badges going forward. I've struggled for a while to know where to cut
off something as deep as Vim, for example. Linux in general has an
infinite number of things to learn. Calling a course even a *Beginner
Linux* course leaves no specific idea of how deep it will go. While it
is impossible to get specific in title, I can establish the expectation
for anything with the word "Essentials" in it.

"Essentials" therefore means:

    Only the required level necessary to fulfill other dependencies
    upon the thing being quantified including entry-level job
    descriptions.

The essentials are just enough to get you working and productive and
able to practice in such a way that most of the rest of the skill and
knowledge involving the thing will come through natural usage and
incremental learning through quick references while using it.
