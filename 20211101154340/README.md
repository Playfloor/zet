# Peiter Lange's kube-backup Script

I can only assume Peiter works for RedHat these days given that his
kube-backup script is in Quay.io and not a part of several enterprise
backup solutions, which I find amazing given its terse description from
the README.md:

> Quick 'n dirty kubernetes state backup script, designed to be ran as
> kubernetes Job. Think of it like RANCID for kubernetes. [Lack of
> capitalization is his.]

This was last updated on January 13, 2020. That's soon to be three years
ago. Maybe that means it is stable. Maybe not. I'm looking into it.

The idea of it is simple enough. Just copy down *every* Kubernetes
resource as YAML and store it regularly into a Git repo.

I'll have to have a closer look when setting up my own on-prem hardware
cluster, still I have to look for better backup solutions out there. I'm
still blown away that anything "quick 'n dirty" is the basis for most
enterprise production cluster backups, 'cuz it apparently is.
