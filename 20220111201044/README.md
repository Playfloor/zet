# Going with Docker Personal for Boost

Docker Personal (formerly Docker Desktop) is the free version of Docker
that educators and such can use without worry. Since we are working with
absolute beginners here this is by far the best option to getting
someone on a Linux command line immediately. Later, after they have some
more experience, they can deal with the complications of using Docker
Desktop for the Enterprise if that becomes a requirement later in their
lives. No sense complicating things at the very start.
