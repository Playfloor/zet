# Twitch VOD Descriptions are SHIT!

I'm so fucking tired of how shitty the interface is for changing Twitch
descriptions. If fucks up the Markdown rendering every time and does not
give you the option to just use plain text. Then, when you export, the
exports fail silently to YouTube because there are compatibility issues.

The answer is to not even use the fucking thing. To just use an API to
set the description to the Twitch videos and to the YouTube video and to
keep them in sync, except I have to fucking write it every time because
there is no shitty app to even attempt it.
