# Weekly Workout Schedule

I feel so retro doing this. I used to obsess over training and workout
routines as a Triathlete in my 30s. Now I'm luck to keep a consistent
weekly run in. But Imma change that, just 30 minutes a day for now.

Mon 3pm Hard Run
Tue 3pm Strength 
Wed 3pm Light Run
Thu 3pm Hard Run
Fri 3pm Light Run
Sat 3pm Strength
Sun 3pm Light Run

Running covers lower body (for me) so strength training is all upper
body, same routine.

I might add another day of strength training after getting through
*anatomical adaptation* phase to wake this lazy ass body up.

I noticed that going beyond 30 minutes a day just makes it to hard to
recover by the next workout (for now) and starts to fuck up my sleep
with all the symptoms of over-training.
