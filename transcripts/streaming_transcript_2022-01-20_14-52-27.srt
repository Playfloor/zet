all right so what do we got we have we have

7
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:34,961
something to do here

8
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:45,263
it is

9
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:21,958
all right let's do this let's do

10
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:28,532
a grits please work

11
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:39,804
I'll be sad if it doesn't work that's really
annoying

12
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:46,802
oh my God I know it's not working I feel so
stupid

13
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:55,128
Oh I took a reboot for me to figure this out
I feel so stupid anybody want to guess I
know it is now

14
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,886
Mississippi

15
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:12,422
anybody want to guess I'll give you a hint
why is that getting printed

16
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:28,136
so stupid I feel really stupid thank God
it's an easy fix all right

17
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:36,489
every single thing the reason yep

18
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:49,195
remember we we still had all this shit left
over I got I got I forgot I forgot that we
saw. That's what this was exported out and
see why this would come in and out yeah

19
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:56,704
I'm going to put a thing here so so here's
the vagrant thing right

20
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:05,210
play use this if you really want live for

21
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:10,965
Rochelle box that is not need

22
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,925
so it's like it's a comment

23
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:22,288
and yeah

24
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,186
it's a career to figure that out

25
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:34,782
I was like I'm changing to make if you keep
forgetting Baker it was even running on my
computer

26
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:40,484
strictly speaking it was regular doctor but
it was running in the doctor computer and
that's why I that's why

27
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,200
so yeah

28
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:54,322
if this means we need to do some stuff when
you kill these environments

29
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,060
exact bash National that should clean it up

30
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:07,527
affection set in Corinth

31
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:17,233
if that's how you feel I have to I have to

32
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:33,718
I got to make an update here are you like a
head smack emoji

33
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:40,494
when's the head smack it smack emoji

34
00:05:43,632 --> 00:06:20,176
aunt

35
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:30,966
emojipedia

36
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,436
forehead confounded face where's the head
slap

37
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:54,686
I think it's called heads left right

38
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:05,413
fishing head getting there in his baseball
baseball baseball courses

39
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,427
horses baseball

40
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:35,477
she has to be here

41
00:07:36,250 --> 00:08:10,049
alrighty

42
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,551
c'est la vie

43
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:23,050
set a why do you think I take notes some
people can make you cannot face the Kathy
what I'm doing

44
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:31,851
this entire problem

45
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:44,344
fine because I was using Docker image which
comes with Live Verse setup

46
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:52,257
how's that baby Grinch

47
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,101
command on my host system

48
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:07,207
so yeah

49
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,678
download mistake

50
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:30,655
it will now we don't know anything we don't
know what's real at all now we can't check
it

51
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:34,276
yeah I just feeling well

52
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:44,385
still says virtualbox right but I want to
test something here I want to unset

53
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,966
unsent vagrant file provider do you have
anger file

54
00:09:53,713 --> 00:10:00,943
and we're going to set it oh I don't know
whether the father is so let's let's try it

55
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:06,289
vagrants up and its use the one in the Box

56
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:14,198
New York hours of ox it got it may I sit
down on the fucking image I don't care of it
LOL

57
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,572
yeah it's Susan and heresy is universal
rocks

58
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:22,739
now what if I don't Define it what's the
default on the system

59
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:29,237
I don't know that I could probably read it
but I kind of want to prove what it is so

60
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,939
what does some kind of that mr. It should
not be that then oh God

61
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:50,157
all right so test number one

62
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,725
come on finish up

63
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:06,631
I noticed it virtualbox takes a lot longer
than we have been hurting delivered I know
that last time too

64
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,574
so

65
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:21,405
is that one live right now

66
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:27,597
straight up puppy yes

67
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:31,921
and let's do

68
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:36,587
the export

69
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,185
I was it

70
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:57,478
let's do an explicit then I want to see what
the default is so

71
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:04,711
first things first let's delete this and
let's play.

72
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:12,131
Well I know we're going to 7.

73
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:16,837
I think it's your fault

74
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:22,588
it does it is ever so much better phone all
right so

75
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:31,233
destroy and I can use by default

76
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,813
and there is no environment variable

77
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:39,495
okay so that's important

78
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,290
so if you want to overcome the default

79
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:58,442
we have to we have to put it I don't hear
anything or did it which one wins if we have
the environment variables that the ritual
box and we have the internal set blood Verge
let's see if he can get it to change the
first of all

80
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,397
all right

81
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:08,378
we know this will break but I just want to
see if it's going to change it trying to
understand your behavior by breaking it

82
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:25,865
Measuring Up This should try up why because
I provided because this isn't a thing or
ignored it completely fucking ignore that

83
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,002
because of this

84
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:45,071
I think I do wear socks again all right

85
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:48,810
and that would be consistent with my
experience before

86
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:56,643
let's force it to be liver

87
00:13:56,671 --> 00:14:01,953
the more of the story is it going to be at
least a document and otherwise just use it
out of the box and it'll default to

88
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:08,596
Oxon Hill the phone number to absolute true

89
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:13,568
cuz this is a crash and burn but it will
definitely force it to do the bird

90
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:32,717
yep Miriam cannot be found that's why we
haven't been able to so let me know need to
be darker and more of the story is you know
just install the default you're good to go

91
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:39,053
and now we were actually going to wait we
know

92
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:46,006
let's try storage now so we know that this
is doing the right thing

93
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,878
Things Remembered I'm set

94
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:03,491
we got rid of it right yeah

95
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:20,353
so that has no reference whatsoever except
that I am an explicitly put the bird in
there and just fucking ignored it so I'm
dropping the provider line completely and I
don't plan on using anymore

96
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,425
this reminder line is required though you
cannot provision

97
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,803
I don't know why me try me try again here

98
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:39,561
for some reason you cannot do when I'm about
to do it you can't do no. Memory

99
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,995
we tried this isn't work I want to try it
again now

100
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:50,770
cuz the hostname wasn't working either so it
might have been something else

101
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:56,492
yeah I'm just a mega morning about Negron

102
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:08,411
yeah it doesn't go there it's the strangest
thing you can't set CPU per machine as to be
per provider

103
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:13,328
I feel like the domain models broken on that
point

104
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:22,448
trying to ask if he ready for Eurasian

105
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:27,978
well you can't do that but I'm not trying to
when I when I do is I want to be able to
have

106
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:34,935
I mean I think I think I think I have to
have an entirely new one of these right

107
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:40,567
like if I if I wanted to have another one

108
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,370
I think I could do this

109
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:52,749
I think I think I can resist just as I mean
it I'm just I'm just fucking around anybody
think you've got anything here

110
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:01,615
and when do professor

111
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,982
ISO

112
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:49,821
I'm I'm I'm I'm a variant fan and now I'm
actually back to me you don't here's another
reason to do it is virtualbox even if we
have to pay for a little bit of you know
extra performance head and the annoyance of
maybe more bugs in virtualbox instead of
chemo the other recipes that I will be
usable on Windows and Mac and everything so
you know it's not going to be

113
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:57,622
I can be more usable thing across the board
so I think that's kind of the way to go

114
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:01,439
exactly the mainstream way to do it

115
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:07,072
I know that the people who do it on YouTube
video covid-19 could you come in a simple
structure

116
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:21,677
architecture and stuff they use they use
virtualbox provider usually from the Mac
actually there's a bunch of them they're
using Max for this and they just they they
run virtualbox on there and they do exactly
she didn't

117
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:26,056
so this is the same a Grinch

118
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:32,501
statues to shut two boxes up yep

119
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:37,351
fragrant shisha bar

120
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:44,308
and we should see memory here we we have
chicken memory

121
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:54,607
and swap it just wasn't needed and if you do
vagrants

122
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,494
huh they have the same

123
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,598
did I not change that

124
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:26,468
oh I change the fuse I just use that memory
all right talk

125
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:39,186
how do I do that it's is it see what is it
what is it

126
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,583
I think it is C yeah

127
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:53,607
a T or C is a t or c I can't you do it

128
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:59,479
I can send me some shoes.

129
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:05,133
CPUs

130
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:14,892
and this is why so that did work that works
that's nice to know you're safe and secured
for this though Contra what is I think this
is it

131
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,110
no it's not

132
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:29,066
seeing you want colors colors yay

133
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:39,287
I can't remember what it is

134
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:47,190
there's one that shows

135
00:20:54,672 --> 00:21:02,130
Kat proxy p.m. is probably better and yeah
thanks guys there is something to do you can
do the top though

136
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:09,201
yeah it is cheap it's too serious that's it

137
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:15,859
but that's naked with a reminder that's what
that's a much better way to do then it's
also available everywhere

138
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:21,842
Galaxy View did not know about that one

139
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:26,340
did not know that Alan

140
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:40,777
it's only wants to do what the fuck oh
that's bar

141
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:50,456
so stupid CPU still only one Seaview

142
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,800
lettuce and Inspire confidence

143
00:21:57,394 --> 00:22:13,226
I know it's going on more now but I still
pisses me off I still have not figured out
how to provision different size mediums in
vagrant and that seems like a really basic
task and I have no fucking idea to do so

144
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,598
yammy both of these words this definitely
worked

145
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:23,565
but

146
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:34,289
no it's not one no that's the version of the
API unfortunately

147
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:42,821
I think I think that is actually imperative
in other words we could do

148
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:57,320
let's try this I think we could do this

149
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:08,936
I don't know but I think you can do this
that's right

150
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:20,756
do CPUs and then you can change it I think
it's again I think it's imperative that I
think you can say okay now I want

151
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:25,655
run CPU do the rest

152
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,692
again I'm still traveling are right I wish I
could read with reading takes so long it's
usually wrong

153
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:54,884
I mean the proof is in the pudding I am more
likely resource go that I have documentation
I am it's just because cuz the dogs are
always so wrong not always a gamble but

154
00:23:55,822 --> 00:24:00,128
In-N-Out so yeah

155
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:07,597
oh wait are you guys getting the wrong Mike
I'm sorry about that I just noticed you're
getting the wrong Mike

156
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:15,368
and nobody said anything cuz you were so
nice to me every time I reboot I have to go
change my bike back to the good mic

157
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:24,731
it it always recesses stupid fucking thing
they're about that much easier on your ears
I imagine

158
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:30,660
it was horrible yeah I still works but it's
just really bad

159
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:37,401
yeah quite a difference huh

160
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:44,449
yeah well I know how I really sound before I
go through a nice soundboard

161
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:51,062
I'm going on the foo

162
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,602
Ella CPU just one just want to see if you

163
00:25:00,024 --> 00:25:07,244
this is the new oh and you follow because I
better sound thank you for that

164
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:11,256
hey can you do an official

165
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:18,951
I do not see a change and I'm I'm kind of
annoyed not annoyed or either documentation

166
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:21,929
nf3 the doctor today

167
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:31,403
God damn it what am I doing I want to see if
you

168
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:42,132
there's only one on there my mother is a
Multiverse I don't know what multipass is

169
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,212
what is multipass

170
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,245
are asteroids ever told by Joanne Sis's fuck
now talk now

171
00:25:55,728 --> 00:26:02,677
that's in a bunch of only thing and I'm
using redhead I need 200 for lunch a person
machines

172
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:07,254
because if I do laundry machines there's a
kind of new kid on the Block multipass

173
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:12,396
I did

174
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:20,039
hey I need to be a manager of blood look no
further than canonical's multipass will ya

175
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:24,485
that would be a hard pass

176
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:29,710
so

177
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:37,429
what are we doing here this is a fail my
test is a fail this

178
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:43,626
did not I do not know it seems like it reads
the first one and that's it

179
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:52,629
anime say something I'm going to change the
first one to use one

180
00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:59,133
ignorant and Tate welcome it's a hobby
welcome

181
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:07,085
that's not a thing destroy I kind of want
dinner I'm hungry

182
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:14,919
destroy bar and Destroy food please are you
going to

183
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:24,149
miles fast why you taking so long

184
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:33,372
wait what when that farting farts booting VM

185
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:38,755
who look it made me a storage

186
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:47,771
Runner storage who key inserted

187
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:54,420
ask me another one my fan just came on

188
00:27:57,274 --> 00:28:02,014
yes I am that's exactly what I'm doing yeah.
Just to learn

189
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:06,165
yeah. Just to learn it but sit with the shit
out of it cuz I need to test them
applications at work

190
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:16,266
you can't do that with Medicaid so it's the
best it's the best way to test Community
work in my opinion

191
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:25,106
I do not answer I know it is but it's just
storage bar right so it makes me wonder

192
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,562
I don't know where it's at me vagrant status

193
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:40,669
I was going to rush my son there vagrant SSH
who

194
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:46,959
they should both only have one CPU oh you
know what

195
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:53,741
last time both of them only had one CPU yeah

196
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:59,498
so the last one wins people all right good
to know

197
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:07,162
yeah watch if I change

198
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:23,985
the bottom one to two it'll make it to even
do this one cuz whatever's last winds even
if it comes before that means this this
thing is not processed in any type of work
at all it's not it's not processed in order

199
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:37,368
except for maybe maybe this stuff like I
think it does this this before this going to
take if your provision one thing before the
other it'll do the one after the other one
because it's in the same block I have a
feeling but if it's not in the same block.

200
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:45,751
So and I probably I probably understand that
if any reveal the better

201
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:53,039
so we on if I do this destroy

202
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:59,884
yes yes yes please

203
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,885
how's it going free Karina

204
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:19,697
I want to send for me but I don't know which
language start with that is a very personal
decision I have done so many videos on that
none of which the best of which is not with
us anymore because twitch it depends on what
you want to learn

205
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:32,716
if you want my opinions on what to learn
first maybe watch the Boost it goes through
that I'm very unpopular opinions is so if
you want to be empowered and then learn
JavaScript

206
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:42,424
becoming data structures first that would be
better than the Yamaha that yellow Jason it
depends what kind of career you want to
write

207
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:57,723
it's like asking what programming language
you should learn is like asking which Hammer
you should learn to use or which saw you
know you're asking to use a tool but you
know it's a tool

208
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:01,285
you know like it's it's

209
00:31:01,285 --> 00:31:06,393
so it's hard for us to answer the question
because we don't know what you want to build

210
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:16,316
I want to put a crown molding do you want to
know it or not he's balking have a really
well yeah because you got to get any of
those little tiny cracks

211
00:31:16,828 --> 00:32:09,140
I want to I want to I want a frame houses oh
well you probably want to use a nail gun but
it but if but if you don't use a nail gun
you probably want to get old clawhammer seen
him saying you need to know what you want to
build if you just want to learn how to code
IE I just want to know how to use hammers in
general that yeah I get a claw hammer is
going to have the most utility
across-the-board right right and so I went
learn pausing shall personally I would learn
bash first and then I would come back and
learn politics after that and that's a
change an opinion on my part from visiting
the last 2 years passing shell is very
dangerous for taking it for beginners so I
strongly encourage you to learn actual bash
unfortunately there is no good material on
how to learn magic after the bathroom and
Paige

212
00:32:09,147 --> 00:32:39,196
everything that teaches bash does it
completely wrong and unsanded unsafe way and
I can justify that statement and have
because it doesn't double if you're going to
look for his promise me this if you're going
to learn to show us her first and you going
to do it make sure you don't do anything but
double brackets and double front to seize in
your end know the difference between double
brackets in the performances and don't mix
the two and use those in Bosch uniquely
never ever use a single bracket if you don't
understand why study the difference and
you'll understand immediately why

213
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:50,629
ringer SSH tunnel professional could I just
wrote you today and it was like all of the
fucking completely insecure totally and
Shell Shocked on yourself

214
00:32:51,166 --> 00:33:51,547
run shellshock I personally if you want it
if you want an overall you know Hammer
that's going to work for everything it's
going to make you good at everything I think
learning bash as a scripting language is
very valuable because it goes with the
terminal right now used to travel a lot so I
can make I can make all kinds of magic
happen and then that the next most important
language after that to me is go because go
is a very very generic language that is very
very highly performant that has garbage
collection which makes it was simple to
write language to but my son is very very
bad for beginners because zeeshan Bachelor
cover that a lot Bashas the default shell on
Millions if not trillions of systems in
seashell is the default shell on Apple
because Apple doesn't want to deal with
gplv3 that's the truth so special is it far
far inferior shell The Bash on every level
and I can prove it this show will also get
you in big big

215
00:33:51,555 --> 00:34:09,120
I will because it tries to do 14 point
mathematics where as it uses the plain old
positive she'll syntax and positive shell
does not do floating-point Matt so Sam is
going to copy and paste Jersey shellcode
into when I get out scripting right if you
want to use the show for interactive shell
that's fine I don't really have an opinion
on that

216
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:20,760
I just wish his usual every time I open
Terminal you know why because they because
they don't want to fucking pay the money and
they don't want to deal with you if you feel
that is the only reason yeah it's the only
reason

217
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:43,700
vagrant diseases did Apple once gplv3 to die
and I agree with them but for different
reasons than one thing and I regret the most
of the badges that is CP3 it is my single
greatest regret but I have to use it because
it's just so fucking powerful and it's the
default

218
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:48,962
it's going to be p.m. all right let's do

219
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:55,328
food now if we did this right both of them
should have to see fuse yep

220
00:34:55,328 --> 00:35:02,920
even though yep they both do

221
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,218
all right so that confirms something for me
there

222
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:15,864
these stanzas right here are not like this
one and then this one right whichever one is
last wins

223
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:22,153
and you cannot change it you cannot change
it for the life of

224
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:25,508
you can't change it for the life of the of
the thing

225
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:30,588
so it's kind of annoying actually

226
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:40,458
but I accept it girls Google that's not true
at all

227
00:35:40,636 --> 00:36:00,794
yeah people are people who say that don't
know anything about go I appreciate that it
what you say is very popular thing to think
but it has no basis in reality or fact go
hasn't been associated with Google other
than people at Google or working on it for
more than probably 8 years

228
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:06,967
yeah if you're frightened of yeah

229
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:14,312
so yeah so yeah no goes

230
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:28,947
the entire fucking kubernetes world not to
mention all of Docker is written in go do
you think if they had any concerns of any
being owned by Google that the entire Docker
project would have created the most
substantial project

231
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:34,361
within the last two decades was written in
go

232
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:41,028
and they didn't do it while they were Google
it if they had had any concerns about it it
would have come up

233
00:36:41,029 --> 00:37:05,284
yeah so I don't people think that Ruby is
independent and it's going to keep him safe
and everything and then they have massive
security vulnerability that they just fixed
finally in the last released and yet it's
run by a ton of people who an entire mod
team just fucking up and quit because they
have disagreements what would you rather
Tire cart to

234
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:21,874
a language that once was created in the
bowels of the most highly intensive
performance-driven concurrent see required
in an Enterprise on planet Earth or one that
was some accidental you know a thing up from
some guy at Mozilla that can't believe it's
gone and blue and

235
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:25,000
he was gone and it has this this this
completely

236
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:29,650
volatile community that then that

237
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:45,382
did you just freaking drink it away. You're
not you're not do your research so I'm not
mad at you I'm just saying do your research
before you make statements like that Google
go Google frightens me too but they don't
have control you if you want to be afraid of
Google be afraid of fuchsia

238
00:37:45,962 --> 00:38:09,969
fuchsia something that's going to but they
do fully control they're trying to release
it and Samsung there and controlling them
now fuchsias the new like embedded device
operating system and that were given full
control of the operating system of most
Micro Devices and that you should doesn't
have any to Pier 33 in it so I would
actually want to use it above some of the
other leg stuff as well although Alpine
doesn't have anything and it Ralph on some
containers

239
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:23,709
yes on topics like I'm easily distracted by
the suffix I feel offended by my strong
statements in a feminist opinions I'm not
attacking you okay not attacking any person
here

240
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:33,411
bring up Wikipedia it was designed by Rob
Pike let me give you a homework okay

241
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:49,781
A Go-Go was created by three of the most
significant software designers and engineers
in history including the creators of Unix C
and unicode

242
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:54,486
name one other language on planet Earth that
can ever claim that

243
00:38:56,524 --> 00:39:04,306
the only language on planet Earth I could
ever even come close to claiming that is see
which was created to make eunuchs

244
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:11,620
and you know it wasn't some accidental
project that maybe Firefox use one day

245
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:22,330
yeah I am I just understand once you
understand who rob Pike is

246
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:34,160
and you understand that Rob pipe work for
Google because that was the best player that
was that was his best alternative to Bell
Labs you'll never

247
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:43,797
I hate guys like Dennis last miles would say
things like I'm interested to go cuz Rob
Pike and that's like the only reason

248
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:50,491
50 Cent just cuz he knows how significant
bike is cell

249
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:57,732
can I people that like that I talk like this
and I apologize if I've offended people but
it's like

250
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:11,440
people make decision if you make decisions
based on the latest YouTube or twitch or
read it rent and you don't actually read
about the history and if you go to Wikipedia
is your sources of knowledge in the universe
you got a problem

251
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:16,212
and it's not you that has a problem it's
people that have the problem son it's not an
attack

252
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:40,016
but you know dig deeper dig deeper ask
yourself what is it used for and who uses it
and why but that will start with that ask
yourself that same question about rust or
python or any other language and by the way
you got it based got it's got to be on what
exists not on what is planned plan stuff
that doesn't exist call vaporware and
there's a ton of rust vaporware right now

253
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:47,800
I can't wait to see Channel if it's one of
your parties can you make beside the web
server

254
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:56,654
are you asking like to give you experience
no glow I expect that's what you're asking

255
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,872
I know you're asking for

256
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:05,330
hey we still don't have two drives

257
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:38,623
going to Fantastic Four anything on the
terminal I used to say that as fast as the
web interface is come out libraries go in at
Terminal applications come out anything goes
most powerful thing is it's concurrency it's
drop dead simple concurrency and its
batteries included from scratch
containerization potential that's why I go
dominates the entire class called native
world

258
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,451
and it completely dominates it

259
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:56,108
if you want to do something really
substantial and go write a container right
find some use for a container and write a
container that is from scratch using go and
you'll understand why goes the darling of
containers you get a 1.5 MB container

260
00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:02,545
you can't do that with any interpreter
language because they have to have a full
fucking Linux OS in order to even runso as
in order to even run

261
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,133
yeah

262
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:27,291
I am frustrated by this because this should
have permission to discs in it did not so
I'm still missing some Basics here and I
don't know what they are and I'm going to
step away from a bit I will be back but if
anybody can help me figure this out all I
want is I want to disks that's it

263
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:35,540
I just want to provision 2 discs containers

264
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:42,572
Dockers were containers started but Dockers
really not the death

265
00:42:43,002 --> 00:43:11,021
Docker containers in kubernetes I can't help
it you won't fully appreciate go and tell
you I appreciate the intricacies of
cloud-native computing containers and
kubernetes container orchestration when you
understand all of that stuff the value of go
just shoots off the page at you because you
see that how well IT addresses all of those
issues

266
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:52,447
alright so I was nice taking a nice little
message from my manager

267
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:55,906
I love my new manager he's awesome

268
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:17,320
he's awesome he's a real hands-off manager
just let you do your thing and produce value
in already it has benefited because we have
already been able to arrive at some
solutions and direction for the team
anything specific that we're working on
building because of that sort of
intellectual freedom to think about stuff
it's been really fantastic I really love it

269
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:25,890
busy there for two years and had my hands
hurt for using Kodi but my hands hurt from
using for task force is work

270
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:28,801
I've no idea how to how to help you

271
00:44:29,582 --> 00:44:34,466
I rarely able to use them anymore I add
where I can Vin don't match

272
00:44:36,025 --> 00:44:45,473
yeah I don't know what to tell you I really
can't if your hands hurt it's probably cuz
you're using mechanical keyboard instead of
a low-profile keyboard

273
00:44:45,474 --> 00:45:12,505
that's the Medical Science on the issue
nobody wants to hear it but that's the truth
the Medical Science on the issue is High
Travel mechanical keyboard no matter how
clicky and smooth those blues and reds are
is medically unsound for you long term even
if you split it out and everything else go
do the research do your own research don't
take my word for it the best keyboard for
you is a low travel

274
00:45:12,507 --> 00:45:22,384
low travel keyboard if you want to split it
up fine but it low travel keyboard membrane
keyboard won't let me go if it's a Memory
keeper you probably probably better off

275
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:29,405
I just went over the first disc you think so
is that your guest list right out

hear anything to back that up or is that a
hypothesis I'm all about the hypothesis but

353
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:46,673
you can't you can't do the kind of make one
disc pretty young it doesn't let you make
another one so

354
01:31:47,451 --> 01:31:52,353
I even that I don't know that it actually
does I don't know then let you actually
build it bigger

355
01:31:52,793 --> 01:31:58,509
if I think this is completely ignored say
the truth if I put 20 gigs here

356
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:06,480
all right vagrant destroy

01:34:54,444 --> 01:35:02,220
running virtualbox Now is it going to have
the extra disk space so we had 20 GB

367
01:35:05,678 --> 01:35:07,509
we're going to see

368
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:21,343
nope it's not is what I don't understand

369

373
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:21,055
it's going to be I don't think it's I don't

374
01:36:28,318 --> 01:36:34,935
I don't think it's working instituted

try that

392
01:39:41,961 --> 01:39:49,236
all right a compatibility with a box do blah

393
01:39:50,164 --> 01:39:53,077
your conversion there as well

394
01:40:00,065 --> 01:40:02,597
just get the checks

395
01:40:12,231 --> 01:40:18,538
to call any communication device matter just
prior to breeding the machine so it says
interesting

396
01:40:19,209 --> 01:40:23,374
so you can do a bunch of stuff to a box

397
01:40:24,469 --> 01:40:31,358
5 a.m. excuse again that's nice is it again
two beauties

398
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:40,292
X2 are you sure Siri is a few yep got that

399
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:56,041
all right with us again that is it how do I
search

400
01:41:14,702 --> 01:41:20,041
I sent a message to Sam host anywhere
private sync folder

401
01:41:21,168 --> 01:41:23,927
that's nice God damn that's nice

402
01:41:26,302 --> 01:41:29,994
that's a fantastic Reagan file

403
01:41:38,822 --> 01:41:44,995
Richard Marx to customize modify p.m. I need
to pick yes name hose params

404
01:41:52,921 --> 01:42:00,184
G memory frenzy fuse customize storage CDL

405
01:42:01,232 --> 01:42:02,637
Annie

406
01:42:06,242 --> 01:42:12,818
oh she has this customized that means it
runs before the customer stuffs runs before
the meeting runs

407
01:42:13,351 --> 01:42:19,420
say controller add second controller as file
exists

408
01:42:19,696 --> 01:42:26,323
f e d i v a customer's create HD full name
holy cow

409
01:42:28,752 --> 01:42:37,221
or is it a chain that is attached to the
storage nice that's why I'm out of him
that's cool okay yeah they should know how
to do it now

410
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:44,332
at Eyeglass World yeah yeah yeah Travis

411
01:42:45,944 --> 01:42:51,873
to set up NFS over vagrant

412
01:42:53,367 --> 01:43:00,163
okay if they are private Network friends IP
National 9 shell provision

413
01:43:00,444 --> 01:43:07,218
s m s fig is there such thing they said the
whole thing without using the forever you
can do through the primers now

414
01:43:07,301 --> 01:43:13,794
service APK. And for the Lazarus are pretty
popping on there

415
01:43:14,811 --> 01:43:18,114
puppet do provision puppet do

416
01:43:19,092 --> 01:43:25,359
oh I'll give that you can put it on there I
think that's Super Bowl sold but it's cool

417
01:43:32,587 --> 01:43:34,924
probably just yes

418
01:43:38,202 --> 01:43:42,429
I'm actually going to skip all that stuff
for now and I

419
01:43:42,441 --> 01:43:48,260
a practice and if it's this for trash I
don't want to do this anymore

420
01:43:51,048 --> 01:43:58,666
is it pretty clear that it does not raise it
sell

421
01:43:58,883 --> 01:44:10,137
I mean that that's why I did that lab so I'm
going to remove it because I don't I learned
everything I need to do. I was comparing
provider storage and I I loaded everything I
need so learn did

422
01:44:16,256 --> 01:44:20,254
episode back to where we were we were doing
so

423
01:44:28,297 --> 01:44:32,307
is that going to work so nothing there

424
01:44:37,513 --> 01:44:44,900
I just deleted it yep what the hell

425
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:51,500
is that the only internal

426
01:45:00,909 --> 01:45:07,833
gesso lab vagrants

427
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:18,021
Freddy's they got the Focus engine

428
01:45:19,623 --> 01:45:27,031
alright so back to where we were

429
01:45:33,381 --> 01:45:36,540
nice so

430
01:45:39,106 --> 01:45:41,585
and what are we doing here right

431
01:45:51,953 --> 01:45:53,964
who did you choose to do

432
01:45:58,856 --> 01:46:21,227
all right so we've got we got our verify
I'll just go ahead and set up an FS on this
thing we don't have to learn anymore we
switch back to the original box and we got
rid of everything else is a few things will
run but you can't add more than one disc at
this this thing is actually ignored as far
as I can tell this entire just fine is
totally ignored

433
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:25,545
and I'm kind of want to prove that

434
01:46:31,604 --> 01:46:34,690
again I've already done it once but I just
want to pray it again

435
01:46:53,598 --> 01:46:55,501
alright so

436
01:47:06,846 --> 01:47:08,507
vagrant

437
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:49,103
yeah

438
01:48:08,931 --> 01:48:10,558
this is just one

439
01:48:15,013 --> 01:48:18,035
how's it going I'll blow

440
01:48:30,835 --> 01:48:41,080
I think I'm going to think if I was going
inside the NFL stamp from scratch we are
going to eat with a new volume though it's a
problem we need we need a new volume

441
01:48:42,955 --> 01:48:48,977
I keep going back to that I'm going to need
a new volume I can't do an offense on the
same mate in baseball and that just doesn't
work

442
01:48:50,787 --> 01:48:53,744
or does it I was

443
01:48:53,838 --> 01:49:01,065
I mean I suppose I could sit well let's see
let's see if I can set up an FS full amount
on a subdirectory of

444
01:49:01,175 --> 01:49:08,023
the the control plane which is a bad idea if
I never do that in real life but

445
01:49:08,527 --> 01:49:25,011
the ideal way to do this is set up a
separate his to set up a separate separate b
m b r i a separate separate volume and then
melt that volume to the VMware instance you
know but I don't know how to do that through
of Africa through vagrant we've looked at a
couple things that do that

446
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:25,625
in a couple things that do that

447
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:35,850
I just think you have to set up a controller
and all that stuff so I don't know how easy
that is to do

448
01:49:45,803 --> 01:49:51,717
so this thing is just the central block that
the thing I can say about this is

449
01:49:52,825 --> 01:49:57,091
that the

450
01:49:59,177 --> 01:50:05,103
partition is 128 cm3 wonder where this
information is coming from

451
01:50:06,949 --> 01:50:15,633
like how what what kind of volume separation
do I have in vagrant from the underlying OS
and I feel like

452
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:20,620
at this is like an arbitrary assignment you
know

453
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:26,833
I don't need I want to figure out how to
tell to change the base

454
01:50:27,636 --> 01:50:35,118
to do that like why is it 17 gig why does it
to sign something to this is Sylvia and
partition in here

455
01:50:37,026 --> 01:50:44,926
and why is this the eighth what is the base
what is a base disposition to have 128 gig

456
01:50:49,649 --> 01:51:00,770
I mean and put a put a timer 27 for this 670
and then it's as it looks like it's leaving
out another 50 to 60 or something like that
they're like a ton of that extra disc that
we can probably partition

457
01:51:02,191 --> 01:51:09,714
and I I mean that's like is arbitrary a
bouquet the base image

458
01:51:13,113 --> 01:51:16,193
oh so that was built into the image right

459
01:51:17,828 --> 01:51:22,336
well I think it's interesting is that the
images build is it sda2 so

460
01:51:22,559 --> 01:51:28,424
based on this I should be able to allocate
another Mount point

461
01:51:37,672 --> 01:51:41,300
so-so Simpson

462
01:51:46,028 --> 01:51:55,794
yeah tell me why I switched virtualbox
because I thought I thought it was going to
allow me to Mount volumes easier than
Lindbergh

463
01:51:57,757 --> 01:52:04,228
the ones that did finals the the final

464
01:52:06,467 --> 01:52:08,155
yeah

465
01:52:09,471 --> 01:52:21,105
well people are saying as much a bugs in it
real the real thing they converted me over
to this was the ability to mount volumes

466
01:52:21,156 --> 01:52:30,513
and that is not possible liver at least not
easily it's not most important in a lot of
ducks on it because I want to test an FS

467
01:52:30,514 --> 01:52:54,134
so this my current goal is to get into Fest
in my career is close to her and the number
away through the original way I was going to
do it as add a new disc at a disappointment
and which apparently has to be done in a
trigger in a hurry up trigger in vagrancy
have to run like a cyst call system call
against a merchant box call

468
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:05,350
how lions are mounted in a yes yeah well it
appears to me that

469
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:13,295
Ben 10 in the second possibility is I don't
even need to do that because there's already
been enough Rogers space allocated that's
free and that's what I'm looking for right
now

470
01:53:13,297 --> 01:53:15,009
cell

471
01:53:17,919 --> 01:53:22,586
right now it looks like there's a tongue
that there's there's plenty

472
01:53:24,956 --> 01:53:32,349
idiot Center Fest it is Danna fastest
fastest legal

473
01:53:42,762 --> 01:53:49,808
the vagrant mozzarella Fest you think it is
I'm interesting to know

474
01:53:50,324 --> 01:54:04,734
here's here's a okay so here's a confusing
thing if I knew lsblk vagrant is showing way
interesting numbers here so I don't went and
told you this get to 92071

475
01:54:03,789 --> 01:54:13,638
then one goes to boot the end of 2017 this
is only got 70 gig allocated so that means
that there's you know some 50 GB

476
01:54:14,342 --> 01:54:19,194
unallocated storage in the SD to Partition

477
01:54:23,436 --> 01:54:31,316
are you sure there are no pretty freaking
fix on the DM I don't know I don't know I
have to go look at it at the VM

478
01:54:32,535 --> 01:54:35,821
have you met current thing and I wouldn't
know about hugging

479
01:54:38,898 --> 01:54:46,064
I think it's the same one we already read
yeah this is a different when you have to
put the plug it in there

480
01:54:46,271 --> 01:55:00,517
this is disappointing I'd rather not do this
I was just reading this one this is using a
I want to exhaust the possibilities without
adding a plug-in and this is just changing
the size it doesn't add a new volume this is
different far as I can tell

481
01:55:00,588 --> 01:55:04,507
I just decided resizer

482
01:55:05,174 --> 01:55:15,491
tell me what I'm missing here there's a to
me it looks like there's a bunch of discs
leftover that's on allocated and it just
doesn't seem to show that right off the bat

483
01:55:16,003 --> 01:55:23,570
70 gig we what am I missing here so

484
01:55:26,591 --> 01:55:30,754
I mean I can't I can't hurt my heart it
better if this is so

485
01:55:34,253 --> 01:55:37,777
at the point is something sa-20 that's what
I

486
01:55:43,454 --> 01:55:50,367
she's a memory 08

487
01:55:53,785 --> 01:56:00,555
this is not the kind of thing you could do
without her it is not eating anything

488
01:56:03,148 --> 01:56:09,815
and this is the danger most dangerous
command in all of eunuchs more dangerous to
DD in my opinion

489
01:56:15,307 --> 01:56:18,396
I checked one command and you fuck
everything

490
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:29,687
there's a partition table you too

491
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:40,505
custom path

492
01:56:48,509 --> 01:56:51,495
I don't think so. For the VM

493
01:56:56,705 --> 01:57:03,522
I can't remember which one it is I thought
capacity

494
01:57:03,522 --> 01:57:10,002
list free list free on produces face yes
that's the one there I thought so

495
01:57:10,003 --> 01:57:15,011
see there's a ton of fun for Titian space
here

496
01:57:25,519 --> 01:57:32,839
this image has a ton of unpartition
discounted was just weird to me

497
01:57:36,634 --> 01:57:39,172
so

498
01:57:42,081 --> 01:57:45,424
70 out of 128 gig

499
01:57:47,321 --> 01:57:52,453
I see here I was just USDA and see what
happens

500
01:57:57,962 --> 01:58:05,050
children's is a colonel thing The Ruck to
send the send files to self today really

501
01:58:05,283 --> 01:58:08,179
I'm not aware of that

502
01:58:09,495 --> 01:58:14,003
the partition 12 ac2

503
01:58:14,566 --> 01:58:19,272
started in sectors and 27 gig

504
01:58:27,335 --> 01:58:34,292
1 gig start 1024

505
01:58:34,668 --> 01:58:42,457
2048 goes to this and this goes to this are
you ready

506
01:58:54,279 --> 01:58:55,857
I guess so

507
01:59:03,016 --> 01:59:07,030
I think it said there's a bigger generated
image I think it is yeah

508
01:59:14,743 --> 01:59:19,761
direct me to the socket oh boy

509
01:59:28,652 --> 01:59:34,803
reggae is pretty sure there's no protective
over here by Jennifer block now

510
01:59:43,028 --> 01:59:50,608
did you have to use a VIP ticket is that it
or a bunch of us our allocation again

511
01:59:50,863 --> 01:59:53,396
yeah yep

512
01:59:53,830 --> 02:00:01,712
yeah I was just I was just what I'm thinking
it is I think it's that but it's it's it's

513
02:00:02,273 --> 02:00:09,981
it's a VM version of it here locally this is
Guy. So why do I care because

514
02:00:10,575 --> 02:00:18,751
I mean I've already burned up 170 128 GB
SanDisk for this disk image as far as I know

515
02:00:19,586 --> 02:00:24,399
as far as we know it now and here's the
other thing is like what is the host of us
look like

516
02:00:25,477 --> 02:00:29,114
Alexis for my mail so I have this Kinfolk
space info

517
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:35,518
this is true to I don't I don't know any of
those commands so virtual

518
02:00:36,865 --> 02:00:39,228
box what are we doing this

519
02:00:40,958 --> 02:00:45,056
it's is reporting 78 but it's not using all
seven again right

520
02:00:49,351 --> 02:00:55,425
a boy how do you spell running

521
02:00:56,976 --> 02:00:58,900
how many days are running

522
02:01:17,374 --> 02:01:22,809
Christmas 2048 single CPU

523
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:33,614
I need to stop that one

524
02:01:46,608 --> 02:01:48,469
power off

525
02:02:09,672 --> 02:02:11,652
configure just file

526
02:02:16,075 --> 02:02:23,248
well I mean

527
02:02:25,035 --> 02:02:28,767
Megan is going to be unhappy because I'm
killing everything yet

528
02:02:40,188 --> 02:02:43,890
they're dead Jim

529
02:03:01,661 --> 02:03:04,094
I'm not using the word anymore

530
02:03:12,805 --> 02:03:19,877
aunt alright so

531
02:03:22,212 --> 02:03:30,117
all right so the one what's the goalwhat's
the goal here the goal here is I want to
mount a different storage volume

532
02:03:36,405 --> 02:03:38,430
and I don't know how

533
02:03:39,008 --> 02:03:45,512
normally would never do this I would have to
just find that I want an extra disconnect
have to create a different controller and it
had it

534
02:03:46,255 --> 02:03:54,224
even through the graphic interface I don't
do that very often the disc metafile

535
02:03:57,398 --> 02:04:02,979
yeah that's what we're looking for a problem
I'm running out of energy

536
02:04:08,742 --> 02:04:14,834
yeah this is going to be useless useful
actually I did this I did this stuff

537
02:04:15,712 --> 02:04:21,426
I tried this discussion is this Cassandra

538
02:04:25,529 --> 02:04:29,685
yeah decide if you do for me

539
02:04:29,685 --> 02:04:33,978
yeah I had this exact thing and it doesn't
work

540
02:04:34,571 --> 02:04:42,018
so I mean I have it but what I don't
understand is how it doesn't show, shows
differently you're saying it's at the bottom
of that

541
02:04:43,219 --> 02:04:52,262
I just meant if I both built into sections
if you're just in clean up this respect. I
just meant if I was inside a machine data
directory

542
02:04:53,052 --> 02:04:57,227
so I was supposed to say we were keeping
track of the last if your state for Des

543
02:04:57,702 --> 02:05:02,591
I just waiting for my Baker for keep track
of it just to be measure I think that's a
reminder uses

544
02:05:03,256 --> 02:05:10,534
that doesn't accidentally delete or men is
just what they were configured outside
records there's advice provider

545
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:20,162
going to the end yeah they just failed to
see what this work to figure out on the last
run a bigger

546
02:05:20,184 --> 02:05:24,788
a at the curry figure say something about
the current run an errand

547
02:05:27,632 --> 02:05:50,897
I don't really care about the size and
already created filed his I don't care I
just want an extra volume as soon as he's
just your ID I just need it for you if it
notices there's no longer than her file, I'm
glad we read this because some of the other
just sand get home that get around this
there's vietnews were too much directly and
there's no way maker knows about that
there's no way

548
02:05:50,900 --> 02:06:05,682
dude I mean vagrant doesn't know about all
of the Hooksett other Solutions are doing
their there the other vagrant options than
out there that you know that get just as
they exit out of vagrant

549
02:06:05,684 --> 02:06:45,071
my using the system which is a thing
apparently in you can put in your bigger
files in the Ruby and then it runs it does
the volume and then attach isn't the reason
I'm leery of it is because it's all outside
of ignorant and this is one of the reasons
I'm concerned because because they got has
this this pedophile which gives it a notion
of what it what belongs to make her and what
doesn't within the Russian boxer better so
to me I really don't care about resizing
though that's not the goal here in the goal
here is I I want to add him as a going to go
here as we want to be able to add

550
02:06:45,079 --> 02:07:12,008
another volume so that I can use that volume
as a while. How's it going how's it going I
do the provider config hash ringing. I was
worried about you better make her an easy
way to keep track and find this information
about this seems to be ignored and I don't I
don't know that it's true I'm still trying
to figure that out so if we if we go to the
vagrant file

551
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:30,679
are those who destroy just we are using
vagrants to provision a baseline collection
of machines that are prepared to be
kubernetes nodes so that

552
02:07:30,679 --> 02:07:48,626
we can then use it to practice and selling
kubernetes and learning communities eating
on kubernetes until you know dies in to see
what we can we can make a type in different
glorious ways and is a couple things so this
here

553
02:07:49,711 --> 02:07:55,930
what why does it say can figure in provision
in this is known for the information

554
02:08:01,312 --> 02:08:06,961
I have to Texas right now cuz I justdestroy

555
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:22,268
I want to shut all those games out I can't
believe how bad I'm going to be a running
that I had not turned up so something about
they going to learn the hard way

556
02:08:22,611 --> 02:08:33,390
the bigger up-down destroy status only show
stuff from your current directory I do I
defuse the global Dash status and which you
tell me what just showed me

557
02:08:36,913 --> 02:08:43,403
because that'll give you all the vagrant
stuff on this machine so as you can see we
have multiple servers here

558
02:08:46,589 --> 02:08:53,605
I'm going to just destroy with careless
abandon yeah

559
02:08:53,832 --> 02:08:56,131
yeah I just tried it

560
02:09:00,885 --> 02:09:09,277
yeah there's there's virtualbox things out
there for the response reminder I didn't
have to bring some extra better anymore
which makes me you know

561
02:09:11,325 --> 02:09:16,829
wonder what's up yeah I mean I could

562
02:09:22,002 --> 02:09:25,686
this is me trying to get the other stuff out

563
02:09:30,607 --> 02:09:36,447
vagrants status yeah I was afraid of this

564
02:09:36,724 --> 02:09:39,543
I can't do it unless he's a doctor container

565
02:09:40,376 --> 02:09:55,308
yeah I'm going to have to like really ripped
that shit out because I switched back from
using the document energy is liver to the
over two boxes works out of the box and
calling it a day

566
02:09:55,918 --> 02:10:03,171
say yeah yeah it's okay move stuff for that

567
02:10:06,457 --> 02:10:10,814
yeah yeah I got it I'm going to try this out

568
02:10:16,173 --> 02:10:24,172
he was a different thing I'm going to throw
away that lab I'm thinking of it cuz I don't
want to confuse people

569
02:10:25,042 --> 02:10:37,457
I think I want to see something. Grade your
token it is delete delete love ignorant

570
02:10:38,791 --> 02:10:46,128
g h delete is it RN or delayed

571
02:10:50,998 --> 02:10:52,720
there is

572
02:11:00,063 --> 02:11:03,500
yeah why just not there anymore

573
02:11:05,182 --> 02:11:12,068
404 in one came and I destroyed an entire
repo

574
02:11:12,351 --> 02:11:14,658
oh hahaha

575
02:11:15,421 --> 02:11:23,461
I had to make that Commando cuz they're like
oh no we're not giving you that command
unless you ask for it make your own because
we don't trust anybody

576
02:11:23,716 --> 02:11:29,143
is really great for like dreaming dreaming
all your you know retrieve photos of stuff

577
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:37,679
yeah if you want that file I'll give it to
you it's

578
02:11:37,775 --> 02:11:42,352
config g h fig

579
02:11:47,186 --> 02:11:50,312
that's the one

580
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:59,463
yeah here it is right here until it's not
that hard of a thing you just have to

581
02:11:59,519 --> 02:12:06,497
is that the upgrade your token to use it
alright so

582
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:12,791
and with that we will now destroy all the
other stuff

583
02:12:14,786 --> 02:12:17,318
on purpose

584
02:12:22,929 --> 02:12:29,254
all right so so what's so remember to box
again

585
02:12:29,417 --> 02:12:36,417
and if I bring a box power. Power. Power off
how about we delete your ass

586
02:12:37,771 --> 02:12:44,638
delete all files cuz why not he's running
Windows

587
02:12:45,975 --> 02:12:51,657
by the way if you want to know if you can't
use of yourself of course yes I do

588
02:12:53,546 --> 02:13:00,474
it's a good thing about me 10 what's my
school education why is it seems like that
including my about me tab

589
02:13:01,828 --> 02:13:06,595
do I have kids I do have kids and I also
have education

590
02:13:09,007 --> 02:13:15,137
yeah I kind of feel like it's irrelevant
though yeah

591
02:13:18,112 --> 02:13:29,779
I'm not one of these people who puts father
you know admin or whatever in their Twitter
because they think that makes him a better
person that I don't fall into that camp

592
02:13:31,324 --> 02:13:42,937
my semester is about me and it's not so much
about my family and my family comes into my
stream that's I talked him a lot and so
that's why

593
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:56,328
at you want if you want me to Mercy and
click on my CV to have that is in there and
you could come and get home there's my CVS
have Anna has every fucking detail about
everything I've ever done so it's not like
I'm trying to you know

594
02:13:57,162 --> 02:14:01,125
I didn't you want to go back and see
everything I've ever done

595
02:14:01,159 --> 02:14:07,365
delete all files

596
02:14:07,627 --> 02:14:30,494
I don't have who I currently work for them I
would never put that in the resume I think
that's bad form I think talking about where
you work is is tacky actually just do it's
one thing to give you more information about
you or your work place I think unless you're
being paid to Market where you working now

597
02:14:31,162 --> 02:14:35,382
if you want that just got to make it home

598
02:14:36,081 --> 02:14:43,982
yeah I'm on that to over there by that stuff

599
02:14:48,237 --> 02:14:51,235
I mean yes

600
02:14:53,026 --> 02:14:59,138
yeah but both my kids I have talked it turns
out it turns out that

601
02:14:59,259 --> 02:15:06,239
my stepson is covid and both of both of my
sons are in college right now both of them
have called out covid

602
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:14,133
I just found that out today by the way I
found out today they told me 20

603
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:20,793
one of them is the one who had his head run
over by a Ford F-150 while sledding

604
02:15:21,152 --> 02:15:34,283
I worry about him so much but I do know I'm
kind of out of their life but I hated that's
true I don't like that's why I don't talk
about it I just don't talk about him

605
02:15:34,286 --> 02:15:41,598
yeah it's a story for another day I have a
really hard time talking about that story
and my Christmas time though I usually tell
her I didn't this year

606
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:51,333
is it it's actually a really Faith promoting
story and I I I I do and I do I do I am okay
sharing it

607
02:15:51,334 --> 02:15:56,820
but it's not about me it's about my my
youngest son who I hardly ever

608
02:15:57,252 --> 02:16:05,743
get to talk to her do anything with now
because Ben but I occasionally I'll I'll
hear him chat or something in an RN or
Discord

609
02:16:08,556 --> 02:16:13,147
yeah I mean it's it's it's kind of a

610
02:16:14,409 --> 02:16:24,198
I think of that it's kind of a to me as a
very faithful morning story Chiefs history
that's good yeah

611
02:16:24,198 --> 02:16:29,556
imagine a lot I do a lot I just don't it
doesn't necessarily all the time right

612
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:33,006
Anna

613
02:16:34,545 --> 02:16:47,746
some people said they just want to stream
all that only you know I was just talking
and shooting the ship which I don't love to
do but I got you know so much to do that
ends up do I end up doing that in the middle
of my other work streams like right now

614
02:16:47,751 --> 02:16:52,569
how many kill this to die die die

615
02:16:56,381 --> 02:17:10,286
yeah I'm I'm really wondering how the
provision of the Fest and I could totally
sheet and just Mount and mount mount the
control the control planes disc as the NFS
disc and then put a sub Mountain there

616
02:17:10,376 --> 02:17:17,921
killing a man I can be yes it definitely got
me I agree

617
02:17:23,869 --> 02:17:25,527
so here wealright so here we go

618
02:17:26,052 --> 02:17:33,341
let's start over so the first thing I want
to know is if this isn't going to work now
going to change it to know none of the
information

619
02:17:35,592 --> 02:17:40,871
say something so I want to check that Civic
wrench

620
02:17:43,534 --> 02:17:48,546
Google status I'm hoping that stuff is all
gone apparently not

621
02:17:50,315 --> 02:18:00,362
I didn't know such a prune invalid issues
with any of the machines you can go to the
director for The Runaway car or you can use
the ID directly with Vigor commands for in a
dream

622
02:18:01,128 --> 02:18:07,076
okay figure and destroy you

623
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:11,764
and I thought I was pretty that

624
02:18:17,121 --> 02:18:22,584
was not found was not found configure for
The Singing River

625
02:18:23,302 --> 02:18:27,382
I had a feeling I got any like isolated Big
Ring completely now

626
02:18:28,954 --> 02:18:36,476
and I don't know that looks like I'm going
to go look at some stuff here so I'm going
to go see if it posted stuff in my dog can
take some place

627
02:18:36,623 --> 02:18:41,719
I assume so no.

628
02:18:42,172 --> 02:18:47,319
That vagrant. D is a thing and you're hungry
trees

668
02:25:04,146 --> 02:25:09,409
I meet you at you don't have to be a child
of the eighties in appreciate Ferris Bueller
oh my God

669
02:25:10,417 --> 02:25:21,488
it's like half this is now he stressed you
were mad you can't say that first or it's
impervious to your attacks

670
02:25:22,243 --> 02:25:28,565
any event there with you yeah I've been
there but I haven't been there

671
02:25:30,902 --> 02:25:40,704
yeah, I'll wait as in Chicago I'm sorry I'm
mixing it with the the one in New York why
am I doing that cuz I'm an idiot I don't
know why I did that

672
02:25:45,919 --> 02:25:48,358
absolute Boomer stuff

673
02:25:48,939 --> 02:25:54,803
every true if I wasn't it if I was a boomer
that's the absolute jenix stuff

674
02:25:54,804 --> 02:26:03,207
yeah it's like John Landis that's why John
Landis and the world of the world of the
world

675
02:26:03,632 --> 02:26:10,759
Bob zemeckis John Landis and

676
02:26:11,606 --> 02:26:16,523
music horse I think I'm perfectly

677
02:26:19,213 --> 02:26:24,527
what are you doing I know so

678
02:26:25,403 --> 02:26:30,468
I want to make a volume that's all I want to
do how is that hard

679
02:26:30,723 --> 02:26:36,505
did I pick the questions did I sufficiently
killed vagrants

680
02:26:37,546 --> 02:26:43,447
look at how pretty it is there's no active
ignorance on your computer thank you very
much that

681
02:26:45,627 --> 02:26:47,113
I think everything

682
02:26:51,515 --> 02:26:57,524
check device to see if they're still there
virtualbox

683
02:26:58,738 --> 02:27:02,372
I need to learn commands for virtualbox
which I do not know

684
02:27:04,465 --> 02:27:16,749
paying $54 actually pulled in my head as
before he's a boomer yes and if it by that
definition yeah leave it leave it to the
generation that invented the term Boomer to
confuse the shit out of everybody

685
02:27:19,343 --> 02:27:27,067
most people that use the word Boomer have no
idea what an actual munar is they could not
tell you I'm just saying

686
02:27:27,552 --> 02:27:40,031
I'm just saying what is the actual
definition of a boomer not not an okay
Boomer kind of thing what is an actual
definition of eminent over my edges of
exactly

687
02:27:41,512 --> 02:27:46,467
after you sneeze I got my dog a god

688
02:27:47,689 --> 02:27:56,583
baby boomer yay what is a baby boomer and
why are they called baby boomer how about
this year's a hard one what was the baby
boom

689
02:27:58,228 --> 02:28:00,268
curious minds want to know

690
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:11,912
we won't attack a generation today but I
just it's just it's always fun to notice the
differences of the bus I just think it's
funny

691
02:28:12,051 --> 02:28:19,697
the generation before the best generation I
don't know and I go to the generation after
the best generation

692
02:28:20,567 --> 02:28:26,632
I think I think you mean the greatest
Generation that's actually think to you know

693
02:28:28,409 --> 02:28:30,662
I don't want to get called that though

694
02:28:30,726 --> 02:28:44,325
the greatest Generation maybe was a
generation who saved us from Trevino
whatever but it was also the generation that
gave his Chinese and Japanese internment
camps and eugenics

695
02:28:44,326 --> 02:28:53,495
so Jenna could definitely forgot generation
that that's actually another term for it
yeah cuz they're kind of weird kind of
in-between everybody else

696
02:28:53,496 --> 02:28:58,799
yeah and we were quiet Genex wasn't loud

697
02:29:00,033 --> 02:29:06,805
remember we were loud but we were allowed in
our own alternative ways or thing until

698
02:29:08,263 --> 02:29:14,791
I don't know do you want to count if you
want to count yeah you got it you got to
count you got to count

699
02:29:14,848 --> 02:29:18,050
lowest fare and all that stuff in there
right

700
02:29:18,051 --> 02:29:23,785
being like this if you're dabbing still a
rumor s 2016

701
02:29:25,173 --> 02:29:32,430
okay yeah sorry I've had no Gen X president

702
02:29:32,430 --> 02:29:39,671
I don't think we ever will gen Z gang
generation

703
02:29:40,315 --> 02:29:44,532
come on now, is she is generous and she

704
02:29:46,644 --> 02:29:52,924
yeah

705
02:30:01,546 --> 02:30:09,310
yeah just thinking about things I read it
anyway they current

706
02:30:09,310 --> 02:30:11,199
vagrant up

707
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:17,441
and all the sudden I have to pull everything
down from fresh this time

708
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:29,303
I mean okay so really that the sole reason
for doing this. I just want an FS on there
and I'm almost 100% sure

709
02:30:29,303 --> 02:30:40,358
I can use in a fast just on the control
plane disc volume which is dangerous I don't
want to do that because I don't want
somebody to see that I did that even in my
sample cuz it's a bad idea

710
02:30:40,359 --> 02:31:06,581
miss you feel your route is kind of control
play me like what the fuck was this guy
thinking and if if you do it if you do it to
test an FS the problem is as well as I can't
test filling it because if I fill it then
he'll blow up a control plane before it
blows up anything related NFS so this is why
I need volume I need a VM with a separate
volume that I can mount as an FS

711
02:31:06,584 --> 02:31:13,040
if I have to do those steps outside of it so
be it but I can't add another volume

712
02:31:13,041 --> 02:31:24,695
to you know I have to figure out how to add
volume to add an extra disc to my to my VM

713
02:31:28,853 --> 02:31:33,764
yeah yeah

714
02:31:35,905 --> 02:31:39,056
so so yeah

715
02:31:41,700 --> 02:32:09,672
I feel like well first of all I'm kind of
glad I switched over to Mercer Bucks because
the method for providing an additional
volume is going to be very very very current
provider specific because every provider
does volumes in in control interfaces
differently and I would rather have
knowledge of her toolbox then the birds
today on that front so so yeah we're going
to need to

716
02:32:10,384 --> 02:32:11,922
to do this

717
02:32:15,498 --> 02:32:22,638
and I'm going to go I'm going to dive into
my research here the best way to

718
02:32:24,011 --> 02:32:30,801
add external volume to vagrant

719
02:32:46,423 --> 02:32:51,229
to the customized here create HD phone and
file that is size blah blah blah

720
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:55,345
what does create HD

721
02:33:20,238 --> 02:33:23,481
Georgia tax SATA drive controller Ford

722
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:33,299
yeah I think it is oh God Vash is crazy
amazing

723
02:33:33,925 --> 02:33:41,481
I use it all the time everyday all the time
Mash dry cleaner versus my editors

724
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:47,059
if you don't understand the Unix philosophy
then we can't really have a conversation

725
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:53,598
SMS Susan Elsa part 5

726
02:33:54,818 --> 02:34:03,522
oh my God that's so amazing are you fucking
kidding me that's going to that's going to
Aunt the game up

727
02:34:04,912 --> 02:34:09,934
hahaha that's going to change the game

728
02:34:20,917 --> 02:34:23,903
okay that's how I cry so hard drives exist

729
02:34:28,378 --> 02:34:30,113
mesh main page

730
02:34:30,164 --> 02:34:45,200
or watch the book if you want to understand
what I mean about bash I'm going to say it
again it's a lot of stuff to watch but go
find the go find the day that talks about
the Unix philosophy that's my answer
actually talk at all about that

731
02:34:47,426 --> 02:34:55,502
I think of that because of something that
nobody talks about it's the most important
part of eunuchs and freaking unit filters
that nobody even knows about it

732
02:34:58,222 --> 02:35:05,437
oh that's phenomenal that's phenomenal.
That's going to be lit a fire under redhead

733
02:35:05,437 --> 02:35:14,699
I love that they're doing that if we get
some competition to that group out there you
know I made it even wait wait.

734
02:35:19,754 --> 02:35:39,118

competition

738
02:37:09,975 --> 02:37:16,237

all right

746
02:39:49,861 --> 02:39:54,750
so fragile. None of those things are
available make a file to a location

747
02:39:56,981 --> 02:39:58,992
Pagan roots of box Drive

748
02:40:02,970 --> 02:40:10,754
Costa Rica cigarettes will know if your
folder Windows 10 do

749
02:40:11,382 --> 02:40:18,277
that's crazy that let you do that I don't
have never drive

750
02:40:19,139 --> 02:40:24,549
I guess I can no I don't want to map network
drive

751
02:40:27,024 --> 02:40:36,717
I don't want it I guess I could do a selfie
the whole point of this is I want to be able
to bring up a drive to go with it I want to
bring up in NFS drive like from scratch

752
02:40:37,605 --> 02:40:45,039
remind this woman FS Furious and snow Milda

753
02:40:44,009 --> 02:40:46,095
Milda in a container

754
02:40:50,666 --> 02:41:01,367
add

755
02:41:03,224 --> 02:41:10,175
additional hard disk volume in vagrants

756
02:41:11,218 --> 02:41:16,927
Tricia locks made it out of second hard
drive

757
02:41:17,416 --> 02:41:20,832
I just I was working on some big Love Stuff

758
02:41:21,970 --> 02:41:25,468
I need a list of things find out that I can
file

759
02:41:28,416 --> 02:41:32,260
2nd Drive it looks good

760
02:41:54,831 --> 02:41:55,768
A fuc

761
02:42:08,269 --> 02:42:11,585
okay just very severe stubbed her thing

762
02:42:11,890 --> 02:42:17,368
here we go it's so we make a disc drive disc
s s w d i

763
02:42:18,130 --> 02:42:39,137
I didn't figure you can figure this stuff I
know I just got to Target so they're going
to use the ice cuz I think somebody already
sent me this one. Let's go through it again
so I can take him to find his license as
soon as he started being box block hostname
got it in her private got that if you have a
sub box provider

764
02:42:42,022 --> 02:42:48,829
I was about to do unless the file exists
disc create HD I don't have create a 2-D

765
02:42:49,402 --> 02:42:51,833
where do you get create HD

766
02:43:00,397 --> 02:43:05,259
where it's going to be a VM thing

767
02:43:13,506 --> 02:43:16,078
or is it provided by vagrants

768
02:43:20,356 --> 02:43:27,199
you know it says customize I like that
that's an internal thing I hope that's true

769
02:43:28,308 --> 02:43:30,652
cuz my storage attached

770
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:39,117
yeah I'm going to when I try to add this

771
02:43:45,087 --> 02:43:47,776
it is a nice cuz you playing now

772
02:43:50,790 --> 02:43:54,310
all right so the Grinch

773
02:43:59,375 --> 02:44:07,548

by the way I don't know why it's not doing
what it's supposed to but that's that's
exactly what it says to do in is not working

774
02:44:07,549 --> 02:44:14,585
give me that there's nothing this

775
02:44:19,051 --> 02:44:20,907
this is

776
02:44:24,370 --> 02:44:32,016
it's it's doing the VM stuff inside of here
oh my God I think I just realized something

777
02:44:33,079 --> 02:44:35,760
I think I just realized something

778
02:44:40,385 --> 02:44:42,468
oh my God

779
02:44:48,344 --> 02:44:54,471

I want to do is I want to take this entire
thing right here oh I'm going to do it an
experiment

784
02:45:22,664 --> 02:45:27,381
I'm doing experiments through

785
02:45:31,604 --> 02:45:36,753
and this one I'm going to make have much
less memory

786
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:48,500
I don't remember having more memory 224

787
02:45:54,160 --> 02:46:01,908
I think it's going to contain it I know you
can provision with ansible that was worth of
oxxo can you

788
02:46:08,257 --> 02:46:14,882
god dammit yeah I know I know

789
02:46:15,133 --> 02:46:18,935
I didn't purpose this a temporary don't just
don't stress

790
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:23,859
an ansible doesn't sound like it's get
bigger and all together

791
02:46:31,367 --> 02:46:47,933
right I would rather look I have no problem
with that I want to come by my insulin
figured I would just rather not have a
dependency on ansible for these tiny things
if I could just put them all into a drink
cuz then I can put in the cloud and I can
say they make a cloud run whatever and then
people could just do a presentation and it
wasn't for some this all ansible

792
02:46:48,913 --> 02:46:59,209
now if I could do the ansible option where
you pull down a provider and Provisions a VM
using virtual box and then does the other
stuff just by running commands

793
02:46:59,875 --> 02:47:14,061
that's probably doable to write because you
can run anything right so I can run that all
the virtualbox stuff direct from the command
line that's another possibility is to do is
to make this make I'm sure there's some
ansible out there that fires up virtualbox
stuff

794
02:47:14,383 --> 02:47:15,707
you know

795
02:47:16,655 --> 02:47:26,052
I'm sure it's out there I just I don't know
I went I would much rather put all this
effort into virtualbox instead of making fun

796
02:47:26,623 --> 02:47:28,187
yeah

797
02:47:28,822 --> 02:47:51,859
I don't if I can if you look I just want to
be at work right now you know but I have a
feeling I have a feeling the answer would be
more flexible because I would be able to do
provisioning and stuff from the command line
it's basically a closer extension to bash
scripting Anthem was way better in Python in
Bosch combination some like that then then
having to force everything under Ruby and

798
02:47:51,861 --> 02:48:12,859
so who knows I might end up ended up
switching over to answer before that kind of
think the vagrant Target usability and user
is a developer he's trying to provision
something really quickly just for the sake
of development and that's the that's the
sweet spot where I'm at but ansible also
could possibly do that tarform has to have a
cloud

799
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:22,463
therefore must have a cloud that's the
that's a got you there and that means you
got to essentially set up a cloud in your
house if you want to do that or on your
machine and that's hard

800
02:48:22,463 --> 02:48:33,809
search her phone doesn't work or try that we
tried to cross the streams on that was
really stupid me I was a stupid we learned a
lot from it but there is a cloud

801
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:40,043
vagrant is designed to do what we're doing
we're like right in The Sweet Spot of it but

802
02:48:40,044 --> 02:48:58,232
it's kind of blocking on simple things like
creating it if you're going to claim to be a
virtual machine provisional that and you
can't create volumes independently then I'm
kind of frustrated by you but I'm not giving
up hope I'm still going to shut right now I
want to test something a little bit
different though

803
02:48:58,236 --> 02:49:05,933
so at the moment I'm going to cancel the
rabbit hole but

804
02:49:07,261 --> 02:49:12,543
and Emmett shouldn't what I just do

805
02:49:14,504 --> 02:49:16,807
oh I know what it is

806
02:49:56,776 --> 02:49:58,857
I think

807
02:50:05,511 --> 02:50:22,578
what would I still at the very basic thing
that I don't know how to do with a Korean I
don't know how to provision a different
separate VM with different stats in the same
vigour and file that's like a really basic
thing and I just escapes me I can't figure
it out so that's what I'm

808
02:50:22,990 --> 02:50:26,662
I keep every time I see another possibility
that I'd give it a shot

809
02:50:32,084 --> 02:50:33,376
UPS

810
02:51:03,778 --> 02:51:07,507
if this works we'll bring up two separate
systems with different stats

811
02:51:09,881 --> 02:51:16,954
this the first time that that last example
we just saw that was the first example I've
seen where they nested

812
02:51:17,631 --> 02:51:23,441
the provider stanza block thing

813
02:51:24,549 --> 02:51:32,016
they put the provider underneath the VM
definition that's the first time I've seen
that

814
02:51:34,107 --> 02:51:39,963
that would apply to me that it can be
changed when we had it outside of that

815
02:51:41,132 --> 02:51:50,363
the last one one we tested the earlier today
whatever the last one was if you had you
known liver and then cpu1 whatever

816
02:51:50,721 --> 02:52:05,450
the last the last block would always win
because it was in a greater a higher scope
so what I'm testing right now is to see if
you put that inside of the internal thing
was that

817
02:52:07,044 --> 02:52:13,575
if I found a word to Define you as a person
down agar down adger

818
02:52:13,879 --> 02:52:21,650
with a person down as your am I just am I am
I a downer am I a Debbie Downer I kind of am
sometimes

819
02:52:22,306 --> 02:52:26,503
I am I don't know what that means don't you
look it up

820
02:52:31,865 --> 02:52:37,533
and informal and older person behaves like
an anchor person

821
02:52:39,486 --> 02:52:45,547
it doesn't name hello fellow kids

822
02:52:48,304 --> 02:52:51,127
yeah I mean

823
02:52:51,619 --> 02:52:56,718
I don't try to understand who I am I just
anyway I don't see why you have to

824
02:52:57,242 --> 02:52:59,880
categorize it but yeah

825
02:53:03,532 --> 02:53:09,291
I'm not dead that's what I am I'm not
fucking dead

826
02:53:14,696 --> 02:53:21,039
it's like you can't pull that off you can
pull the tables

827
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:29,691
that is largely true play current status

828
02:53:30,141 --> 02:53:36,079
statues two things are up

829
02:53:36,230 --> 02:53:42,939
see if they differ shall we figuring a
sensation control

830
02:53:44,754 --> 02:53:50,054
and free I'm free

831
02:53:50,210 --> 02:53:52,812
Free Fallin

832
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:02,766
wait what it doesn't make any sense

833
02:54:06,145 --> 02:54:09,461
1.3 GB available

834
02:54:11,613 --> 02:54:18,828
oh total are we go nevermind okay I got it
now that's Mega and not gig by 21

835
02:54:20,681 --> 02:54:27,478
have fun area code

836
02:54:27,478 --> 02:54:29,690
that's what we're doing ping dad

837
02:54:31,070 --> 02:54:43,123
as there's a box in Vidor there is someone
else can use a broad and not just the devil
local I agree about terraforming is a reason
I went down

838
02:54:44,955 --> 02:54:47,930
and you know what I'm glad you said that
because

839
02:54:48,507 --> 02:55:00,605
did terraform stuff that I've been doing was
based on liver and liver just fucking died
so terraform has to have a provider just
like anything else right

840
02:55:02,368 --> 02:55:21,461
if their form has a good liver has a good
every box provider then we could do all the
stuff that are for him and then our
knowledge would cross over to using care
from the wild I mean vagrant okay so let's
let's talk about the three tools that were
evaluating here really vagrants

841
02:55:22,269 --> 02:55:29,730
ansible and terraform and there's a big
comparison of the three out there but I was
going to recap it really quick so

842
02:55:30,158 --> 02:55:34,875
vagrant is an old tool written Ruby and
everything that targets

843
02:55:35,597 --> 02:56:35,590
bringing up virtual machines really quickly
for the sake of development and testing
that's his primary goal and it has a bunch
of you know old history has got a registry
of tons of tons of stuff for that purpose
specifically for that ansible is designed as
the Univest agentless configuration manager
so you can you know use composition from
software world and things like that to
manage lots and lots of of virtual machines
as if they were real machines as if they
were software so you can like say I want you
to have this on there and you can manage
everything remotely in and do all things to
configure those things as simple as for
configurations to configurator right enter
form was specifically designed originally to
to form you know huge architectural things
composed of virtual machines and all the
other stuff that you may want to

844
02:56:35,597 --> 02:56:56,665
so it's like a a larger solution to 22 it
and all three of those things that I just
mention can be used to do what we want to do
two different levels with different levels
of difficulty so when I went into this the
first thing I attempted was terraformed
actually know the first thing I checked it
was vagrant

845
02:56:56,990 --> 02:57:01,994
local Devon darker just have already did
that we did that for a full month it's not
possible

846
02:57:01,996 --> 02:57:07,857
yeah if you're doing okay so if you're doing
local development

847
02:57:08,137 --> 02:57:52,042
yeah many Cuban kind do not okay so this is
why I ran into the dipping didn't even asked
for this before so I'll say it again so the
reason that I'm looking at virtual machines
at all instead of saying any container at
staying in a container ice World easy mini
Cube kind in my own variations on it is
because I want to write it specifically I
was going to write something that monitors
the volume utilization either as a staple
said or Damon said and that would run it
with the you essentially the underlying the
underlying disc and it won't be able to
report how close to being full it was it was
a tool hack been in the front during the
process I realized that

848
02:57:52,044 --> 02:58:43,076
if I wanted to test such a thing by breaking
it so my obsession with containers you know
this last year for his application is almost
my head is I think it's Justified but
there's a borders if there's a boundary at
which you can't do stuff and the battery is
anything that's going to blow up your
so-called nodes and systems because when you
blow up a note or system that's associated
with darker in any way you blow up the host
which means I stop streaming in my whole
system goes down because I actually that was
what triggered this I was going to go try to
see how they hate what happens if I overfill
this this PVC right if I was if I totally
fill it up Beyond its capacity well the PVC
is implemented as the default Rancher
storage class which uses the darker you know
localhost to storage and that's my hard
drive

849
02:58:43,079 --> 02:59:01,777
if I if I were to do that because their PVC
does not own PVC does it say can I have this
much stuff it doesn't say you only get has a
huge huge Revelation to me about storage in
kubernetes a PVC is a request for at least
this much storage

850
02:59:01,779 --> 02:59:07,538
it doesn't mean it doesn't mean you can't
use more than that

851
02:59:07,538 --> 02:59:25,185
there's nothing that checks to see if you're
using more it's not like carving out a
volume that's what I thought it was when I
went in to Cooper Nettie's I thought so it's
a BBC I was going to carve out a volume for
just this application know. It's a request
is a polite request to say I need at least

852
02:59:23,871 --> 02:59:38,999
hey I need at least this much storage can
you give it to me please this is done and it
didn't like sleeping around but I don't
think it's I don't think it's the right way
to do it

853
02:59:40,544 --> 03:00:39,783
what you are doing now. I was just wondering
about it. Dr. Guess I'm kind of trying to
explore all the different ways to do
applications development and Architectural
testing and that includes a returning to an
interest in vm's I was kind of Aunt Ivy in
there for a while wanting everything on
communities in that was dumb because you
need VM to test stuff out of my how you
going to test the device drivers how you
going to fuzz 40 days how you going to vm's
are an essential part of the development at
every level in industry and you know and
thinking that you're not going to need him
it is a 30% hit if you if you deploy a VM or
a group of yams a lot of yams and then you
put Grey's on top of that you're wasting
your wasting architectural processes that
stupid you should probably seek a nodes that
are on hardware and you said that with them

854
03:00:39,790 --> 03:01:40,028
if you want to save up to 30% and
performance but if you're doing development
and you're doing you know testing and you're
trying to get the cloud doesn't do it so
it's a lot more work to do that and you
probably want to do that in the Enterprise
eventually get the performance boat boost
but you have to have things like that put in
place and you have to reboot in at the
tweaker nefud all the stuff and I've been
doing with the provision that I've been just
like shutting it down and restarting it you
see how fast it goes it's a pretty slow
right now but if I had to do that with
physical hardware and a net boot it would be
even worse right and have a great week I had
a good week my image at the save my tftp
image and I have to reboot the machine with
tape freezy gabs amount of time to get the
iterations that I need so when people say
infrastructure as code that goes for
development so when so when you're dealing
with different operation in operational
deployments architectures you can actually
tweaked a little thing for the prince
statement here redeploy your architecture
put a statement here read a player
architecture and you can either ate at same
way of software

855
03:01:40,037 --> 03:01:54,136
for what and it feels really good because
it's very goddamn it and the time it would
take to do this kind of thing before was
insane and I was just insane right so this
this just has that much how much the other
one has so let's go

856
03:01:56,704 --> 03:01:58,850
SSH

857
03:01:59,089 --> 03:02:10,902
call the local I just different it is but
there's a problem you can't test storage
classes you can't test see a nice you can't
you can't test

858
03:02:11,048 --> 03:02:22,917
different implementations of of Ingress it
can't test load balancers unless you have
your own on Prime option there's a ton of
stuff you cannot do

859
03:02:22,917 --> 03:03:14,793
because you just can't because the cloud
provides its own the sewn all of its own you
know storage classes everything that you
have to like build your own and you can't
write your own software that fulfills a
storage cost for example if you use if use
if use any of the cloud providers you
another reason I'm interested because I'm
very interested in developing software for
Cooper Nettie's I wanted to know if I
eventually want to be able to code
implementations of storage class software
and stuff like that and make sores classes
that back right that the interface that's
not in the face the pain and then go
straight to Synology or whatever you I would
really like to be able to write that code
and it to be able to test a storage class
implementation there's no way you can do
that in the car because the cloud forces you
to use their stores class

860
03:03:16,541 --> 03:03:34,407
he's a storage, other than grass controller
I don't think you can know there's from what
I've been told anyway I've identified a lot
but I've been told that there's some of that
stuff you can't get to you do you don't have
a choice you have to use theirs I'm almost
positive that's the case for load balancing

861
03:03:34,598 --> 03:03:37,409
yours in traffic on azure

862
03:03:37,409 --> 03:03:59,177
that yeah that's different though right and
I don't think that using a load balancing
you mean we have to look at each individual
thing but I know of at least two things that
do not come with

863
03:03:59,179 --> 03:04:03,799
kubernetes if you're doing on priem NeoCube
ATM set

864
03:04:05,299 --> 03:04:29,588
yes I'm saying so that's why that's why
that's why I would look that's why I would
look that's why that's why I want to do an
on-premise or something and and make it easy
to just fire one up and blow it away right
let me just to hold this hold Cloud cost to
which is not much just told me how we just
passed the styrofoam stuff and he did it for
like five bucks for the cloud time you know
on Amazon whatever

865
03:04:30,059 --> 03:05:07,273
it is just things but you can your eye color
going outside the lines if a plant is in COD
if you do that ya don't know that for sure.
We also talked about to vomit yeah yeah it
depends what kind of like what I was doing
all the Jupiter home development and
adjustments I was using me to giving kind
for all that completely and and that's a
different thing again the reason I'm doing
this is because I am realizing there's
multiple tools in the toolbox for emulating
communities at different levels oh my God

866
03:05:08,933 --> 03:05:11,210
and

867
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:34,548
it's so you know that's that's what I'm
talkin about I there's multiple tools in the
toolbox and I have sought to understand them
all so far and a couple of them I have not
yet fully fully examined and that's one of
his suit I we just I now realize I've just I
found the I finally learned something

868
03:05:36,037 --> 03:06:07,518
it's easy to do development on the cob
absolutely if I was if I was going to do
development I would I would stick with the
cloud of any caves or something like that I
wouldn't but I'm not I'm about I'm about 60%
development 40% of operations I would say I
kind of want to change that ratio I want to
be at least fifty fifty and I feel like my
operation skills have gotten really soft
especially lately I can do my my mounting
and volume stuff and not having an affair
skills

869
03:06:07,522 --> 03:07:07,907
yeah yeah that money for development for the
moment I would not do anything that I'm
doing right now but especially we're going
to see this actually we're going to the
calendar and I'm glad about that because
we're going to when we start doing the Boost
here let's get this give me the first boost
is going to be you know mr. Rob he doesn't
know how to do this stuff just figuring it
out with you that's the Boost that boosts
will get better every year but this boost is
designed to do nothing more than to
kubernetes eyes you know convert your
application development application for
communities in there is some strict design
differences between designing something to
run in kubernetes and just designing it to
run on a service somewhere it's totally
there's some real strong considerations that
actually impact the the back end and the
front and architecture of how to do that and
if it if you go into it thinking oh hey will
just throw it all in committees later you'll
end up designing stuff and if possible

870
03:07:07,918 --> 03:07:21,174
I know you're not talking about the Boost
I'm just pulling this up because I'm just
mentioning it everybody we're going to be
talking about these issues coming up and
we're going to be doing administrative stuff
too and that's going to include why you
might want bigger and return form that kind
of thing

871
03:07:21,177 --> 03:08:04,306
Senior Communities customers eksu always aw
yeah Tech stuff that is in a scent on me to
make it with her yeah it doesn't I'm taking
on the harder point on purpose because that
hardness is essential to understanding on
priem the Plymouth for Enterprise and that
is my job my job is to keep an eye on priem
non-cloud on friend Cloud deployment you
know with no other vendor running and
getting as close to a deployment at home
that I can to that same to find me that I
support at work is really critical

872
03:08:04,309 --> 03:08:21,734
and it's different it's different it's
absolutely different than what you would use
in the cloud 100% And and that's that's why
I'm doing a real big plus here I don't know
if you noticed but this one has has as 10:20
and that's got one gig and and Anna says far

873
03:08:21,735 --> 03:08:26,930
less wait to see her

874
03:08:28,811 --> 03:08:35,412
memory I take control has

875
03:08:35,828 --> 03:08:38,455
fresh air

876
03:08:38,455 --> 03:08:45,189
as far as far less available total so this
one has like one less than

877
03:08:43,675 --> 03:08:51,302
someone Megan this has one place that's
little bit that's about to most of the can
call another.

878
03:08:51,786 --> 03:08:58,061
So if they're not know I don't know where
you're getting that impression that is not
true

879
03:08:58,317 --> 03:09:32,009
not the people that I talk to everybody in
my realm is absolutely not talking about the
glass they're docking about on friend yeah
it just depends on where you're talking on
YouTube videos in an overall in oh no ways
on the internet yeah it's and marketing it's
all about Cloud it's all about picking one
of the providers and going from there if you
if you talk to investment Banks like Porsche
I don't know for sure is that the investment
banker whatever I think for sure it is as
mentioned that they are with one of these
Enterprises

880
03:09:32,012 --> 03:10:18,527
yeah yeah if you're it if you're if you are
some of these other people in our community
they deal with Cloud but but their primary
purpose if I think the portion mentioned
that they were air-gapped which means they
can't even touch the cloud there is a lot of
really substantial Enterprises where there's
big money to be made and lots of work to be
done where they do not want access to the
internet for anyting and these companies are
in need of Specialists to help set up on
Prem kubernetes appointments and that is my
chosen Focus I would rather focus on that
and that's the world I kind of want to see
us living I don't particularly like your
baby different than us

881
03:10:18,532 --> 03:10:28,751
I might be I mean and someone in some
respects I I mean a lot of these
multinationals that we work for I know mine
does is in Europe for sure and so

882
03:10:28,751 --> 03:10:42,207
yeah yeah I would be the one to ask you
about that they have got a lot of access to
multiple Enterprises it but I think it's I
guess the caution I would say is it there

883
03:10:42,367 --> 03:10:47,174
there is a lot of things happening that no
one hears about

884
03:10:48,633 --> 03:10:58,331
if you go to a conference and you hear about
it we talked about that with you macaroni on
the sap Sunday when we when we had him all
over the interview

885
03:10:59,185 --> 03:11:34,525
remember that web is much more skewed toward
Cloud yeah and my research absolutely when
when that's occasions is a hundred percent
skewed towards called because if they can
get out there really fast and and that makes
it that's fine that's like a nice
alternative to serverless for them right and
I'm I support that completely in fact that's
what they say about hybrid cloud like our
organization does have stuff on the cloud
and it's usually the public facing
microservices and rest apis and things like
that that are in the cloud and then they
just did the fat communicating between them
is a thing you know

886
03:11:35,466 --> 03:11:37,544
going to find a job

887
03:11:37,799 --> 03:11:53,659
I mean there's lots of ways to get into a
group home lots of ways to get into it I am
made the booster so we can with my opinions
on how to get started in the best way
recently wrote A Blog about that

888
03:11:54,198 --> 03:12:01,209
yeah this is a recent thing I just wrote
actually

889
03:12:05,042 --> 03:12:16,369
I am not trying to put you off at your store
advertised I'm just I've already answered
this question is a lot so you don't have to
agree with the stuff that's in there I just
that's how I answer

890
03:12:18,136 --> 03:12:21,781
I'm sitting outside of a structurally
communities

891
03:12:21,781 --> 03:12:37,792
so we actually have made a discovery I have
made a discovery I don't give a damn about
anyone I want them in with my statements
there so I won't do that

892
03:12:37,793 --> 03:12:45,573
what have just discovered is the proper way
to ensure that

893
03:12:47,177 --> 03:12:54,578
you get a different number and the truth of
the matter is I actually know when I can do
now

894
03:12:54,578 --> 03:12:58,214
and I'm going to change it to something that
actually matters

895
03:12:58,214 --> 03:13:15,914
and I want to know what that means so in my
in the setup I want to have an if statement
that says if the name is cloud I want to see
fuse Eliza I mean I want

896
03:13:15,915 --> 03:13:23,875
I want to see videos of I just want one so
I'm going to say this if name equals and I
don't know how to do this

897
03:13:26,966 --> 03:13:34,109
control Right End else

898
03:13:38,371 --> 03:13:41,131
and I want to see fuse

899
03:13:42,007 --> 03:14:02,225
it was one that I have been looking for how
to do that and the secret is by embedding
the same provider inside of the iteration
which makes me very happy so that should
actually work I'm going to try that now
vagrant destroy

900
03:14:05,488 --> 03:14:06,876
vagrants

901
03:14:10,416 --> 03:14:17,371
I love your work and working within a camera
so see Alexander so you can play and I can
read

902
03:14:18,714 --> 03:14:36,204
yeah that depending on the application
that's going to be fine but I would I would
maintain that that's going to be less and
less possible and that application
developers creating significant software are
going to have to stop thinking about

903
03:14:36,241 --> 03:14:41,937
I'm just going to make this thing I'm going
to head over to devops going to put it into
a container and put in a couple days I have
to think about it

904
03:14:42,327 --> 03:15:42,781
the more significant the application let me
give an example of Alaska search right the
more significant the application the more
aware of how it's going to be deployed it it
has to be more aware of those considerations
the developers have to be and and this
simpler the application is just a micro
servers and one gives a shit it's answering
one question while the storage involved and
so I'm going to that would be that would be
my suggestion is that people doing software
development and need to start thinking about
what is this going to look like when it's
fully deployed and if you just want to be a
programmer keep your nose down and do you
know it's clean and just just you know give
me this thing I'll give you the same for
this out pointers this one service has to
answer this question but if you're going to
move into the software architecture and
design which is what most of her when she
knows I think want to do then you you have
to think about the larger picture about it's
going to be deployed and

905
03:15:42,790 --> 03:16:42,910
can't do that without understanding and
communities and doctor from another larger
perspective for example we had somebody know
this is not I'm not putting anybody down
here but we had somebody the other day try
to compare go to Python and by how big the
containers were and they were putting go
they're putting a go compelled binary into
an Alpine container and comparing that to
python and a python VM inside of a python
container and that is a newbie mistake
that's a newbie mistakes because they don't
understand containers and I didn't
understand containers a year ago but one of
the advantages of go is that you can do a
friend's couch container and they just met
today like thank you so much for saying that
because I didn't run trash container and I
went from 2.6 you know whenever MB to 1.5
for The French Press container that's
because the developer didn't understand the
advantages of doing a front sketch container
and they may if they were making a software
decision about what language to pick and
stuff like that at the design session while
they are we going to develop this blah blah
blah

906
03:16:42,920 --> 03:17:37,472
they may have picked node or typescript or
Ruby or Southern Python and it be fine but
they would have made a significant
performance decrease because of that
decision when they could have wrote it
written it and go or roster anything is
compiled the data from scratch container
that means that the developer has to know
what from Chris trash containers work with
and how darker works because that's how it's
going to be able to lead to Floyd and that
it depending on this the number of of you
know the pods are going to end up from that
piece that component that's a really
substantial change really substantial on the
order of like two or three hundred percent
safe means of of ramen and all the other
discs everything so that's why that's why I
mean that's that's why I think the higher up
you want to be in the software development
architecture their money you want to make
the more higher you you're going to need to
understand

907
03:17:37,480 --> 03:17:45,266
you know the cloud the cloud thing the cloud
native thing and it means thinking of your
app from the very first day about how it's
going to be deployed

908
03:17:48,593 --> 03:17:51,046
yeah

909
03:17:51,384 --> 03:18:05,115
Play Summer came into communities and they
had no idea what persistant voice for it's
going to happen I'm just saying what but
other people are aware of I'm just saying
that

910
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:17,892
I'm just saying that it's not going to be
enough to just learn typescript and write
code that's not going to be enough going
forward more and more

911
03:18:18,644 --> 03:18:38,581
as a volunteer form I think most of us
absolutely absolutely are and that's why I
want I wanted to kind of shoe horn my my
local stuff in Dancing with their form just
because I didn't want to the cognitive
overhead of maintaining Ruby very very vague
and file knowledge and I would rather learn
as volunteer form than vagrants right

912
03:18:38,582 --> 03:18:48,115
but that's not the sweet spot so it's kind
of kind of hard to do that big rinse up

913
03:18:49,210 --> 03:18:59,190
it's going to bring up all three not if I
did this right then only the control plane
should have two CPUs and everything else
should have won

914
03:19:00,863 --> 03:19:07,701
and I'm going to confirm this is true I'm
going to make us a lot about this cuz I've
learned something here I keep hearing about
polygamy

915
03:19:08,929 --> 03:19:21,295
yeah does that does that help your buddy
still a fucking hate HCL I wanted to like it
so bad cuz I'm such a hash of core Fanboy
but I cannot like it

916
03:19:21,721 --> 03:19:29,321
I just can't I try so hard and I just cannot
like it yeah

917
03:19:31,307 --> 03:19:42,235
I might I might be with you on that I
continue to hear really respected people in
my my community recommend for me to Mia and
I I definitely want to look at that

918
03:19:43,328 --> 03:19:46,572
Yogi really hear you can holyshit

919
03:19:47,098 --> 03:19:54,765
does it run on top of terraform or is it a
separate product from terraform that's super
cool

920
03:19:57,164 --> 03:19:59,787
that is really really cool

921
03:20:22,896 --> 03:20:30,808
sometimes the easiest and simplest yes I
agree is a mushroom is it better is it
compatible

922
03:20:36,409 --> 03:20:43,801
I can find get something videos on YouTube
channel I have to find a specific one

923
03:20:44,738 --> 03:20:48,059
based on those ideas you got filter

924
03:20:48,554 --> 03:20:55,305
you can't just do videos on that maybe if
you want to search my soul casting go to get
Hub and search

925
03:20:55,580 --> 03:21:02,954
let me show you so I can which one are you
looking for group hug what are you looking
for communities for example right

926
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:09,455
set query vagrant

927
03:21:09,466 --> 03:21:31,453
that'll give you another that's a link that
will give you and you can search GitHub for
specific things if you want to search for
videos you have to go it's so hard to find
the video search yeah if you're going to
search for vagrant I don't think I have
anything on vagran I have beds on links

928
03:21:31,454 --> 03:21:48,595
the search bar on YouTube is almost
impossible to find ya let me show you the so
I made a little thing to help people out but
if you go to YouTube and you want it you can
probably know this more than I do but if you
go to somebody's channel right

929
03:21:50,148 --> 03:21:57,005
hi Rob. So then you click over here do you
have to see what I just did there

930
03:21:57,005 --> 03:22:04,374
in order to search just my videos you have
to go all the way to the end and you click
this little thing here

931
03:22:04,375 --> 03:22:10,886
and then you can search for whatever you
looking for you can search for

932
03:22:11,489 --> 03:22:17,293
where do you find a filter based on ID
number another number is not in there

933
03:22:17,293 --> 03:22:34,974
there's some that it not everything has a
video I should probably say so but the
things that happen if it's in the
description and I also haven't made
everything into a video so yeah and there's
there's two this is the best I can do

934
03:22:34,976 --> 03:22:41,188
I just get lab my knees are really all these
are like years old

935
03:22:41,467 --> 03:22:47,938
get a real job not just a job yeah that
doesn't haveyeah that doesn't have a video
that's not a video yet

936
03:22:48,230 --> 03:22:50,213
no that's

937
03:22:52,070 --> 03:22:59,622
is that chat did I did I did I do it wrong
Zedge

938
03:23:00,047 --> 03:23:07,913
chat job they're so that's the if you linked
to that

939
03:23:08,429 --> 03:23:11,189
that will give you the right one

940
03:23:13,306 --> 03:23:17,649
yeah I would like to make it easier to
search but so far it's

941
03:23:18,502 --> 03:23:30,387
I'm always trying to figure out better ways
of doing this is more of the most important
thing of all is that I can find my own stuff
I won't lie I'm very selfish that way

942
03:23:53,793 --> 03:24:01,005
YouTube Channel video search doesn't work
the greatest if it's tagged with an ID

943
03:24:03,819 --> 03:24:05,476
I was like a number

944
03:24:08,044 --> 03:24:12,297
well I'm trying really hard to make it so
that you guys can find searchable content

945
03:24:24,614 --> 03:24:26,373
why is it taking so long

946
03:24:27,307 --> 03:24:33,416
this is something I've noticed it takes
significantly longer to start to do all of
this stuff with virtualbox

947
03:24:33,959 --> 03:24:42,053
Gmod the human liver and stuff was way
faster to provision like like twice as fast

948
03:24:44,737 --> 03:24:52,397
cell yeah I'm doing right now is I'm

949
03:24:54,713 --> 03:24:56,182
yeah

950
03:24:56,362 --> 03:25:16,302
so you know why are we doing this again well
we're doing it because there's more support
for virtualbox and apparently it's easier to
create volumes which I wanted Mountain
that's what got me switching back over so
this is nice so vagrant

951
03:25:16,751 --> 03:25:22,741
status give me all of the statuses on the
system and that's like way too long

952
03:25:23,027 --> 03:25:28,039
alright so let's see vagrants

953
03:25:29,268 --> 03:25:32,061
SSH control

954
03:25:34,661 --> 03:25:37,338
l s u p I wonder if I'll even work

955
03:25:39,030 --> 03:25:43,749
she name is that sound can you actually
execute a control command

956
03:25:44,231 --> 03:25:52,236
I wonder if you can execute control
coronavirus Circle you can nice oh God I'm
learning so much

957
03:25:52,414 --> 03:25:56,398
that she Alice see if you

958
03:25:57,473 --> 03:26:04,239
so keep your family God dammit

959
03:26:04,928 --> 03:26:09,726
that looks like there's only one see if you
on the control plane

960
03:26:10,428 --> 03:26:13,347
that means my if statement failed

961
03:26:19,224 --> 03:26:23,363
that means my instatement failed

962
03:26:28,306 --> 03:26:31,940
yeah there's something wrong here I don't
know what it is

963
03:26:45,730 --> 03:26:52,049
I don't know I don't know if Ruby I mean
it's been so long I don't remember it

964
03:27:02,863 --> 03:27:05,760
all right so let's do

965
03:27:10,646 --> 03:27:13,820
b l a c

966
03:27:16,084 --> 03:27:22,608
no no no no no no no Ruby Rose Ruby

967
03:27:29,076 --> 03:27:30,976
complete guide

968
03:27:37,922 --> 03:27:41,951
let's see here definition and whatever

969
03:27:43,665 --> 03:27:46,135
I want to know if the string

970
03:27:53,214 --> 03:27:54,654
AccuWeather

971
03:28:04,330 --> 03:28:06,582
I mean it should just be equals right

972
03:28:16,150 --> 03:28:24,084
and I feel so dumb I feel like that is
famous not working

973
03:28:27,545 --> 03:28:30,336
I really have to do like string match or
some shit

974
03:28:38,250 --> 03:28:46,191
no I had it right I didn't write you so why

975
03:28:55,134 --> 03:28:57,416
I want to set only works with memory

976
03:29:01,417 --> 03:29:04,394
god dammit

977
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:14,096
maybe I need to have this earlier

978
03:29:25,337 --> 03:29:27,792
when you think you might have any ideas

979
03:29:33,698 --> 03:29:36,804
maybe maybe there's not

980
03:29:51,174 --> 03:29:53,531
I don't know I feel like it's not getting
here

981
03:30:10,811 --> 03:30:13,895
I mean this is a long way to do this but

982
03:30:17,498 --> 03:30:19,326
you know I can probably do it here

983
03:30:29,222 --> 03:30:35,827
I'm giving you this get rid of this give me
this give me that give me that

984
03:30:37,230 --> 03:30:39,003
and keep this

985
03:30:49,809 --> 03:30:57,008
parents LOL

986
03:31:28,293 --> 03:31:31,376
well is it run this like every time

987
03:31:34,056 --> 03:31:37,603
let's give you a Jersey

988
03:32:04,874 --> 03:32:06,256
only gotwhen we got

989
03:32:27,527 --> 03:32:30,839
see here

990
03:32:35,785 --> 03:32:40,203
I wish it was say it it's not saying I'm
going to have to go all the way in here and
see what happens

991
03:32:44,050 --> 03:32:51,210
why does it have to pull the whole thing
every time I think we need to do that link
thing so that it doesn't do it as fast I
mean it didn't take as long

992
03:33:05,646 --> 03:33:07,531
I don't know man

993
03:33:15,108 --> 03:33:17,438
all right that wasn't as bad

994
03:33:28,035 --> 03:33:34,244
why did it have to run all that control
stuff everytime I don't understand why I had
to do that

995
03:33:35,107 --> 03:33:41,466
every student read it again I said something
about CPUs and there that you can't change

996
03:33:42,109 --> 03:33:44,831
it's it's like freaking me out so

997
03:33:45,973 --> 03:33:50,235
apparently could change memory but we
couldn't change the number c fuse

998
03:33:52,464 --> 03:33:55,720
so I can buy if I change the number of

999
03:33:58,747 --> 03:34:05,147
I mean let's do the other one let's do node
Austin don't wanna

1000
03:34:11,674 --> 03:34:19,304
so same thing same thing

1001
03:34:20,393 --> 03:34:23,758
more more stuff to tester

1002
03:34:31,790 --> 03:34:38,185
let's change put memory in here

1003
03:34:42,240 --> 03:34:45,163
I mean

1004
03:34:45,978 --> 03:34:57,756
I could have swore that we just figured out
how to do this and how we have a provision
differ memory based on the the the name that
we did that

1005
03:34:59,539 --> 03:35:04,747
we did it by providing by providing another

1006
03:35:05,946 --> 03:35:07,625
VM

1007
03:35:16,957 --> 03:35:22,134
I wonder I wonder if it's because we have is
like this template very well here I wonder
if the

1008
03:35:23,107 --> 03:35:26,116
remind me Casino name is to find here

1009
03:35:32,974 --> 03:35:38,307
I know I don't know I don't even know how to
test it I don't know I just feel like

1010
03:35:44,073 --> 03:35:57,667
I'm we okay so we we broke all of this out
and we did two separate ones and that worked
so now the thing I'm trying to do is trying
to say okay if the string matches this do
something conditional inside of here

1011
03:35:58,106 --> 03:36:04,593
and that's not happening so

1012
03:36:05,101 --> 03:36:10,320
I could be there's two CPUs or not something
we can change or could be the air
conditioner is not getting matched

1013
03:36:10,834 --> 03:36:17,523
but then it was multiple times with it if
condition was matched so

1014
03:36:18,392 --> 03:36:21,777
it has to have something to do with house
being cold

1015
03:36:21,777 --> 03:36:29,401
because it's Puget Sound spewed all that
stuff across the screen

1016
03:36:31,593 --> 03:36:35,171
so so that has something to do with it

1017
03:36:41,685 --> 03:36:48,068
I mean I've actually I think I know how to
do this without usingand without using this
statement so let's stick with that

1018
03:36:51,764 --> 03:36:57,136
and put in here do you know who wanted to

1019
03:36:59,099 --> 03:37:05,479
and we have those 10 gig of memory provision

1020
03:37:07,710 --> 03:37:12,163
and 1st ncph

1021
03:37:15,169 --> 03:37:19,853
yep all right so let's keep that head up
here would just get rid of this

1022
03:37:26,337 --> 03:37:30,023
I want to keep this for multiple control
points I'm going to have one for now

1023
03:37:33,612 --> 03:37:38,341
I might add like 3 or 4 control place like I
wanted to control one or something right

1024
03:37:38,365 --> 03:37:41,746
so really that Emily B is to

1025
03:37:42,464 --> 03:37:56,617
since these are virtually the same things
which is why I was figuring I can call if
I'll call another function most I just want
to see if you think that would work out so
let's try to do this this actually worked
with memory so it could be the fact that it
could be his memory just into it

1026
03:37:57,154 --> 03:38:00,079
that could be that could be the option

1027
03:38:19,925 --> 03:38:22,175
Suns schedule

1028
03:38:25,337 --> 03:38:28,795
I'm going to save the shelter cuz those take
forever to run

1029
03:38:31,936 --> 03:38:38,371
and come back if this works I know this is
like slow morning but I kind of need to do
it

1030
03:39:32,085 --> 03:39:35,967
hahaha do do do do do do

1031
03:39:36,320 --> 03:39:40,843
they are insecure key detected we will
replace it automatically

1032
03:39:43,418 --> 03:39:50,321
it does make me wonder if we could do this
is just with ansible I'd much rather do this
with ansible and vagrant

1033
03:39:52,234 --> 03:39:55,067
it's just yet another cold one right

1034
03:39:56,909 --> 03:40:01,394
assholes got way bigger future than bigger
until for this kind of thing

1035
03:40:05,118 --> 03:40:11,622
it is said to have a VM hell you can write a
script

1036
03:40:12,460 --> 03:40:14,386
automatically

1037
03:40:16,948 --> 03:40:21,891
I don't know why I say that that way I'm
just I just do

1038
03:40:22,179 --> 03:40:25,398
I have my own weirdness

1039
03:40:26,372 --> 03:40:33,947
one CPU let's see about control and be mad
if it's not there

1040
03:40:37,455 --> 03:40:43,481
God dammit what the fuck

1041
03:41:04,018 --> 03:41:07,303
that's only three of megahertz that's
interesting

1042
03:41:24,259 --> 03:41:31,003
this is what I wasthis is what I was afraid
of so this is the same behavior I was seeing
before that makes me wonder

1043
03:41:32,636 --> 03:41:35,710
I know it makes you is it 2.9

1044
03:41:37,820 --> 03:41:45,748
you see what I'm saying this this provider
line right here overrides the CPUs for this

1045
03:41:47,133 --> 03:41:53,148
memory doesn't memory doesn't watch if I
give this

1046
03:41:53,680 --> 03:42:03,165
I already tested this this is one of my
testing you know it's not working so I don't
know what the fuck is going on so this one
we tested and it definitely works

1047
03:42:03,658 --> 03:42:10,493
so yeah I don't know

1048
03:42:12,330 --> 03:42:21,287
I kind of want to look there I am like this
close to just doing this with a bash script
and then putting that in ansible

1049
03:42:21,404 --> 03:42:40,434
I am really close to doing that because
because the thing that's fucking is up is
the Ruby from the vagrant that's like not
being interpreted properly if I was if I
knew if I was dealing with the command for
the provider that's creating the allocation
I think I would be better I would probably
be better to do this has been stripped

1050
03:42:41,186 --> 03:42:56,502
I'm like I'm really seriously thinking of
doing it that way because half of this
project is in the provision script most of
the project is in the provision script right
and all that does is just get run on the
system which I can definitely run just by
putting it over there on my own

1051
03:42:57,309 --> 03:43:19,991
and I have to provision Avea volume and I
have to figure out what the fuck did the
main lot late languages to provision the
volume and every one of the add-ons that
says to do volume permission he says to exit
out of your Ruby vagrant and run this
command that was going to provision this
volume for you willing to just fucking
provision the volume using VA using the
verse about commands directly and call it a
day

1052
03:43:21,632 --> 03:43:41,669
I think that the extra layers of technology
in here are fucking is up on the fact that
it can do that he can provision you know
three of them at the same time it's not even
doing any synchronously the fact that it's
pulling the image down off the internet and
cash it into doing all that that's kind of
cool but I really don't give a shit

1053
03:43:42,070 --> 03:43:43,966
it is

1054
03:43:44,065 --> 03:43:55,915
I mean it is spitting it out you know but
those are all things that can be done from
command line calls to to virtualbox and
virtualbox is the primary provider anyway
for vagrant

1055
03:43:55,915 --> 03:44:11,364
call Vivian box manage APA ya using the
customer saying yeah because you saw all
that they are every time that they had a
vagrant thing yeah be customized modified
bmidc fuse to ya

1056
03:44:11,366 --> 03:44:12,833
right

1057
03:44:13,255 --> 03:44:48,006
but the thing that's taking the thing is
kicking my ass right now is it it's this
nebulous Ruby object that it is sort of
Adventurer than is called a different
intervals obviously the look every time I
change of every time I change the value here
the last value wins so this has no is no
sense of scope or anything and if you're
going to call it infrastructure as code then
you give you should probably do things like
you know observe the scope of the Blocker in

1058
03:44:48,009 --> 03:44:58,134
which which I'd I swear to God I got to work
with memory we just tested that it worked I
was really hopeful then I went to do it with
CPUs it didn't work so I'm going to test the
PM's now and see if it works

1059
03:45:00,496 --> 03:45:37,069
otherwise otherwise there's some arbitrary
order in which these two things are executed
and whichever one set the CPU last wins and
this stuff is escaping out of this block
scope and it's affecting all of it as if it
were a global that's like all the problems
you have a global programming and is it just
makes me want to throw the whole fucking
thing at the door again because I'm fighting
with Ruby here I'm not even fighting with
vagrant I'm fighting with Ruby here and if
I'm going to be fighting with Ruby you might
as well fight with ansible and Bash which I
know which are more relevant for the My
overall job than vagrant

1060
03:45:37,097 --> 03:45:48,616
and I ain't got no style of vagrant I like
that it's been able to pull up everything
pretty quickly and it does it does some
extra magic that I would have to figure out
how to do is Bash

1061
03:45:48,617 --> 03:45:55,457
it almost did something it look I'm not it's
not on the shit list but it's okay

1062
03:45:55,458 --> 03:46:02,562
right now until until I figure one thing out
if they got his kind of back on the shit
list

1063
03:46:02,563 --> 03:46:05,197
because it's a

1064
03:46:04,513 --> 03:46:10,691
a really really hard thing to say I want one
disc with this much memory as an extra
volume

1065
03:46:11,048 --> 03:46:21,064
that should not be difficult the whole point
of a thing like this is to be able to say
hey give me this extra discs I have this
final and amount it right and

1066
03:46:21,149 --> 03:46:24,527
Municipal point of provision in the first
place

1067
03:46:25,856 --> 03:46:33,112
the fact that this you see me change these
things 3 or 4 times right watch what happens
if I change it if I change

1068
03:46:34,205 --> 03:46:59,412
how many something else to test this I'm
going to change this one to two and you
watch all of them are going to have two CPUs
even though they are completely scope
differently all right and if someone's going
to say dumbass why you doing that this is
why I didn't tell me that I want you to tell
me that but the fact that changing the CPU
count here is going to affect this EP
account of the controller of the control the
end that's up here which is entirely
different block

1069
03:46:59,417 --> 03:47:03,921
it's fucked up family work Sia

1070
03:47:05,774 --> 03:47:09,008
yeah we'll see you at 5 if I make it through
it

1071
03:47:10,065 --> 03:47:14,903
so so this is this is really this is really
it

1072
03:47:15,600 --> 03:48:06,306
I didn't even construction trade this this
last test is the first is the last time I'm
going to fuck around with anger and believe
me I have been a vagrant fan has been doing
things really well up to now but this shit
with volumes and the ship was scoped
configuration sets is a pain in the ass I
would much rather have a yamel file for that
and if I have to make my own tools to do
that so bad and I just might it's just might
because it's not that hard I mean it's not
that hard it's supposed to be just calling
calling provider is right well who really
gives a shit about any provider besides will
Starbucks right now and then I can guess you
wanted understand delivered stuff I guess
people wanted to that bed but why I had a
layer of abstraction there when I just go
direct to the thing that you're using and
interpret that

1073
03:48:08,665 --> 03:48:16,217
so I'm going to if this doesn't work I'm
going to try with ansible next to do

1074
03:48:16,546 --> 03:48:23,699
did you try to do see if you can sit in
change change note to do

1075
03:48:23,948 --> 03:48:31,309
she was one I think I think I think what
you're saying is any the answer is yes

1076
03:48:31,310 --> 03:48:33,465
think I tried that

1077
03:48:36,515 --> 03:48:49,131
the test that I did that appeared to have
taken was I did this appear and this down
here and I ended up with machines that had
different memory so far the seat fuse is not
working though

1078
03:48:49,478 --> 03:49:03,785
now when I say V. Two CPUs it does say to
but then I wonder will this one I'm doing
LLC for you is that the mistake is Ellis if
you showed me one CPU with 2 GHz

1079
03:49:03,786 --> 03:49:07,448
and I know I have four GHz CPUs

1080
03:49:08,105 --> 03:49:21,677
so what I wonder is going to do something
magical with a number of CPUs and then just
throw it down the makers I don't I don't
know how that stuff works so that was one of
the reasons I was maybe talking about that

1081
03:49:52,249 --> 03:50:02,218
and Prok I didn't look it in for Oculus look
at that next time it's possible it's very
possible that I'm looking at the CPUs
completely incorrectly

1082
03:50:02,219 --> 03:50:07,276
that could be the case I would really like
that to be the case actually so

1083
03:50:07,279 --> 03:50:10,696
let's first of all try free Dash age

1084
03:50:17,631 --> 03:50:24,860
ellipse now we're just trying to memory
comparisons right

1085
03:50:24,860 --> 03:50:28,999
total is you know

1086
03:50:30,807 --> 03:50:34,230
let's try on control

1087
03:50:39,251 --> 03:50:41,630
I want

1088
03:50:47,171 --> 03:50:53,410
oh no I'm really confused because it's like
it's not even seeing the two different
things anymore

1089
03:50:56,466 --> 03:51:03,712
Speck provider for the machine at the global
config I think you're right

1090
03:51:08,092 --> 03:51:13,778
well you know okay I honestly I don't
remember the test I did I need to recreate
an eye test

1091
03:51:14,031 --> 03:51:19,902
so the test I'm pretty sure that test I did
was I I did two completely separate configs

1092
03:51:20,819 --> 03:51:26,767
yeah I think that's what happened I thought
I was going to be able to scope it within
here though and you cannot do that

1093
03:51:28,369 --> 03:51:29,917
so

1094
03:51:30,931 --> 03:51:40,118
oh wait oh my God I feel so fucking stupid I
see immediately what my problem was to see
my problem is

1095
03:51:40,410 --> 03:51:46,722
I found it I think I found it I found it so
I'm back to liking bigger and again

1096
03:51:47,067 --> 03:51:54,746
there's no problem here config I'm so stupid

1097
03:51:56,322 --> 03:52:17,246
I'm stupid I feel stupid I feel so stupid I
was so stupid that was definitely the
problem that would explain perfectly because
that was it was almost as if I was changing
a variable in a scope outside of the block
because I was

1098
03:52:17,832 --> 03:52:24,833
it's exactly what I was doing all right well
in a live and learn live and learn

1099
03:52:26,437 --> 03:52:33,782
I feel very confident about this next
attempt I do I feel very confident that was
it

1100
03:52:34,614 --> 03:52:51,792
the reason I was doing it since I was trying
to test that I have made some people have
this this van provider thing outside of the
scope and then some people have it inside of
the scope so I would be really surprised if
this doesn't work if it doesn't work I went
through a bigger nothing fucking window

1101
03:52:52,526 --> 03:52:59,404
I'm sure it will though cuz that was like
user error I was like oh he

1102
03:53:03,128 --> 03:53:06,647
we're not doing all of her Disney so it
should go pretty fast

1103
03:53:08,086 --> 03:53:13,164
Reagan up I really don't want to have to
maintain Ruby my whole life

1104
03:53:13,326 --> 03:53:17,695
so I'm still not completely

1105
03:53:18,207 --> 03:53:25,417
yes we have a very complex relationship so
what else is new

1106
03:53:40,764 --> 03:53:43,414
here's my questions

1107
03:53:44,241 --> 03:53:51,899
do we still want to even if this works do we
still want to look at ansible for this kind
of thing and and

1108
03:53:51,900 --> 03:53:55,754
do you think ansible skills are better than
vagrant skills

1109
03:53:57,796 --> 03:54:22,168
this is strong part of me that wants them
thinking about others as well it's like when
we helped introduce this whole thing to
others who are just getting into the
infrastructure engineering kind of thing how
essential is vagrant we do and supposed
essential we know that we know that
something like telephone or Plumbing is
probably going to be a part of it as well

1110
03:54:22,784 --> 03:54:30,650
you know I don't know I figured I think
Megan is more on the bike yam

1111
03:54:31,013 --> 03:54:54,038
people people even okay so developers are
Developer friend earlier was saying that
when they have them at as they used their
former and terraformed to do is to carve out
their children in the cloud and then they do
development there and they bring it up or
take it down and stuff and that's pretty
common right

1112
03:54:54,039 --> 03:55:04,109
at turbo Mansoor sense will make sure I
don't run across the lawn M so it's what I'm
trying to get my I keep coming back to

1113
03:55:04,277 --> 03:55:11,601
oh yeah they still do there's a lot of
people that still here but I keep coming
back to

1114
03:55:12,101 --> 03:55:23,730
if we can even if it's a little bit more
difficult because ansible a terraformer not
designed to do this what we're doing
everything we can wait to yeah yeah

1115
03:55:24,753 --> 03:55:33,887
it wouldn't use anything from you from a
vagrant is is ansible as a red hat thing so
you must not use your head

1116
03:55:36,590 --> 03:55:43,271
but you're probably aren't you running a red
hat Enterprise self OS I was going to say

1117
03:55:57,173 --> 03:56:02,544
really your whole system's I don't know
about that

1118
03:56:03,480 --> 03:56:12,411
I am having hit a few barriers there already
I don't know how do you do you put us in
Lenox back on it then cuz it doesn't come
with it right

1119
03:56:14,338 --> 03:56:15,775
interesting

1120
03:56:22,536 --> 03:56:24,808
wait now I'm really confused

1121
03:56:31,405 --> 03:56:38,906
are we wanted the same we wanted the same
memory of course you did we want some lsusb

1122
03:56:39,497 --> 03:56:43,116
I'm sick of you wait

1123
03:56:56,010 --> 03:56:57,641
come on

1124
03:57:09,588 --> 03:57:12,816
never go that was it all right

1125
03:57:14,647 --> 03:57:21,688
I can't believe you have you have a pain
running said haha interesting

1126
03:57:22,475 --> 03:57:27,071
yeah I don't like asking Lenox at all if I
could get a ride around it I would

1127
03:57:27,170 --> 03:57:31,033
does that fulfill all your like government
requirements of stuff

1128
03:57:32,495 --> 03:57:37,175
because I mean are like let you know that
kind of thing

1129
03:57:41,958 --> 03:57:46,183
I feel like that was a long and drawn-out
tedious thing

1130
03:57:51,225 --> 03:57:57,868
a name equals control ac fuse

1131
03:58:09,037 --> 03:58:14,238
are securities a sec interesting

1132
03:58:16,325 --> 03:58:22,453
a ever played with Harbor we've been looking
for Harbor for a scanning I'm just curious

1133
03:58:35,289 --> 03:58:48,186
yeah I mean it seems like the best internal
registry these days right I actually did
come back to we need to set it up as soon as
I'm doing all this artifactory yeah that's
another big one

1134
03:58:48,664 --> 03:58:50,316
yeah

1135
03:58:51,942 --> 03:59:16,396
interesting options out there I know it's a
tough it's a tough to pick him right hard to
tell to help guide others and say hey which
you know which things do you need to learn
here so many options and it is a crapshoot
you know that you invest in the right thing
and I can be very frustrating isn't making
her coming into it it's like which things
should I learn you know

1136
03:59:21,238 --> 03:59:23,521
oh nice try

1137
03:59:27,369 --> 03:59:38,512
it worked last time so the only thing I
added here was an if statement because I
wanted to make sure my review I am pretty
sure my baby was correct and it just was in
the wrong scope so this should fix that
problem

1138
03:59:39,165 --> 03:59:55,345
I mean I have to remind myself that just the
ability to redo Baker destroy vagrant up is
a massive savings and time if you were
trying to imagine trying to provision these
systems using actual machines to do this
testing

1139
03:59:55,349 --> 04:00:00,090
the iterations I did in the last hour alone
would have taken me a full day

1140
04:00:00,091 --> 04:00:05,240
I mean I would just it just it just blows my
mind how much virtualization

1141
04:00:03,748 --> 04:00:24,599
how much virtualization has sped up work on
every front and Industry whether it's you
know looking 40 days like the most of those
or you know sampling network engineering in
architectures or testing up and it's just

1142
04:00:24,601 --> 04:01:01,591
is really amazing fact it's so easy it's
causes has caused all of our infrastructure
to get far more complicated because we can
script it and because we can script it then
all of a sudden navigations we make are not
just singular applications there now
composed of multiple components that spread
across multiple containers running on both
the movie ends and that increases the
complexity and if we don't have these other
tools we will be shipped out of luck cuz I'm
to be so complicated we would never do
anything like that in the old in the old
days back in with no one server went out
kind of situation

1143
04:01:14,189 --> 04:01:15,428
aunt

1144
04:01:57,278 --> 04:01:58,647
see her

1145
04:02:10,504 --> 04:02:18,315
a stranger thing that should be fine
two-course oh my God

1146
04:02:20,270 --> 04:02:22,788
my if statement is not working

1147
04:02:28,108 --> 04:02:34,142
I didn't change the preset messages to
change your number it's not working

1148
04:02:37,225 --> 04:02:44,004
you can't do this oh I put name equals

1149
04:02:47,144 --> 04:03:02,528
that is like the worst how many of you made
that mistake before you know what that is
what's wrong with interpreted languages
that's one of the main reasons not to use
and interpret language everybody want to
explain to our friends out there what just
happened

1150
04:03:03,961 --> 04:03:13,204
because I used assignment guess what
assignment always evaluates to true so the
condition was never fall so that else never
happened

1151
04:03:13,206 --> 04:03:35,705
I cannot tell you how come in that are is is
really really common infected in and no you
have to do a job description have to do
three of them to get it to really write you
measure asked me to talk about Unix Linux
kernel different distros different teas and
why they should try doctor and get something
better to tell me when I finished you get a
raise or you're fired

1152
04:03:37,740 --> 04:03:44,588
what are the two yes but it's talk are you
fucking kidding me

1153
04:03:53,553 --> 04:04:31,453
oh my God you know what it came out in 2013
I knew it was I just didn't learn it I knew
how important is going to be I still didn't
learn it I didn't need it if I didn't think
I did you know how much it would have helped
my education I could have made Docker images
for the kids to take home put on their
laptops and stuff and I didn't do that I
regret to no end that I did not learn Docker
in 2013 at the same time that I deployed
skills tag because I was sending people home
with virtual machines that stuff and if I'd
known about darker I could have seen it for
station Docker containers and I could have
said all of my python stuff as a Docker
container run on their laptops and they
would have had to log into the server

1154
04:04:31,458 --> 04:04:35,355
but it didn't and I force them all the log
remotely SSH into the server

1155
04:04:35,876 --> 04:04:39,624
on a big exercise machine like I see Iron
Man series

1156
04:04:40,637 --> 04:04:44,919
not a long time no

1157
04:04:47,343 --> 04:04:54,150
oh my God that's crazy is it going to rain
over there

1158
04:04:59,475 --> 04:05:03,379
all right last time then get this right

1159
04:05:04,895 --> 04:05:07,795
this Irish talk about something related

1160
04:05:14,340 --> 04:05:15,909
oh my God

1161
04:05:16,535 --> 04:05:22,785
oh my God I'm so sad for you I'm so sad for
you

1162
04:05:23,944 --> 04:05:35,202
you know I thought I was bad that everybody
on my team uses putty to connect to the
server they have no idea what two months is
or how to use it and I'm just like or even
screen for that matter

1163
04:05:35,610 --> 04:05:45,829
and they're great people the right people I
am not putting them down there phenomenally
brilliant people are just amazing people
they just they don't think it's necessary

1164
04:05:46,580 --> 04:05:55,450
I don't want to do this Tech talk anymore
all God he wants me to show how to click
here and there

1165
04:05:56,490 --> 04:06:00,474
did he have you talked about Lenox and then
bitching about it and become relevant

1166
04:06:00,506 --> 04:06:58,648
if you don't use Linux I don't know man but
I you know what are well I'm glad you can
come here and vent if there's one thing I've
always wanted to be for the people that
build a lot of communities then you know
it's the retreat for teachers and we would
all get together on the beach literally we
would get together on a literal vide virtual
Beach and we were just shoot the shitz and
just complain and vent and then we would go
back to our work and we would get stuff done
and if this community can be that for people
as well as helping them learn I think it's
really important people understand that that
your job is not everything and otherwise of
the job you're working at the people don't
know Linux don't know what team was just
doing whatever right and they might have a
limited view it's super easy to start to
believe that that's how the whole world
looks at things and that's wrong so yeah
traffic status

1167
04:06:58,908 --> 04:07:06,667
10 years behind in their go to that but it's
also behind what's today's market yeah yeah
it is an and that's kind of

1168
04:07:10,990 --> 04:07:14,649
but there's more than one God hey look to
see if he has to work now

1169
04:07:14,651 --> 04:07:23,213
oh my God I feel like that's a major thing
I've definitely walking to shut down all
right so

1170
04:07:28,795 --> 04:07:52,483
so we got we got I got the conditional note
stuff at now it back to volumes and you know
if it's I am praying to God that it's
something we can do inside a vagrant without
having to get specific but I've been taking
a quick break I'm going to walk around at 7
so and we come back we're going to do the
volume mounting

1171
04:07:52,486 --> 04:08:00,001
and that if if if I don't do anything else
tonight except for the volumes to melt and
use in a Fest so be it

1172
04:08:00,014 --> 04:08:03,659
Osoyoos tattoos

1173
04:08:06,692 --> 04:08:09,963
I get there from here like a dislike Wick

1174
04:08:19,849 --> 04:08:22,323
alright so

1175
04:08:25,354 --> 04:08:31,108
love to Virtual box and tighten up

1176
04:08:34,867 --> 04:08:37,622
yeah I'm good one thanks pal.

1177
04:08:38,464 --> 04:08:45,078
Yep thank everybody for coming by I'm I'm so
going to be here I'm just going to take off

1178
04:09:15,161 --> 04:09:19,181
boy oh boy oh boy

1179
04:09:28,366 --> 04:09:34,406
all right yeah I'm going to I'm going to be
and go going to break her

1180
04:09:36,454 --> 04:09:38,892
my brain is like mush right now

1181
04:09:50,258 --> 04:09:55,893
08 we're going to keep this up this is how
did you get yeah we were going to get that
one all right

1182
04:09:56,714 --> 04:09:59,062
all right see you in a bit

1183
04:10:18,722 --> 04:10:19,950
232

1184
04:41:43,630 --> 04:41:51,599
oh that's very good cheers

1185
04:41:52,424 --> 04:41:55,473
put a case on it this time yeah

1186
04:41:59,265 --> 04:42:01,718
Rona

1187
04:42:28,997 --> 04:42:34,505
so yeah c'est la vie

1188
04:42:35,118 --> 04:42:40,059
city of Eden island survival mode

1189
04:43:00,366 --> 04:43:07,204
all right we're going for it we're going for
an FS mounts

1190
04:43:07,981 --> 04:43:10,588
which means we have to get it volume created
first

1191
04:43:13,898 --> 04:43:21,799
which means we're back to breaking it in
wonderful ways a Porsche

1192
04:43:22,407 --> 04:43:28,785
tagged at Beast I kinda want to tag him with
a spending special

1193
04:43:29,611 --> 04:43:37,566
tagged free and if s

1194
04:43:40,607 --> 04:43:46,382
I'll delete that time later but I just want
to be able to go back to that take if I need
to that specific one

1195
04:44:14,805 --> 04:44:21,623
all right alright alright alright alright
alright vagrant

1196
04:44:22,401 --> 04:44:28,080
file then what else we need

1197
04:44:29,906 --> 04:44:31,789
what else do we need

1198
04:44:38,138 --> 04:44:41,333
god dammit god dammit

1199
04:44:45,192 --> 04:44:46,995
we need

1200
04:44:52,902 --> 04:45:00,024
I don't know if he's going to work this
brand is going to kill me I was going to try
and set a variable

1201
04:45:00,087 --> 04:45:06,150
I don't know why it has to be the second
disc we say b a n f s

1202
04:45:07,566 --> 04:45:14,988
if they don't want to learn who I am am I I
said the wise are you documented procedures

1203
04:45:15,771 --> 04:45:23,081
I know it's probably safe to say but I
understand your concern there

1204
04:45:24,188 --> 04:45:40,042
after all this yeah actually really am
enjoying this I'm actually liking this more
than gaming lately I had I had I won four
straight games with serious down so they
just probably last night you can look at it
to my team in history if you believe me

1205
04:45:40,043 --> 04:45:46,112
so I might do that later I'm actually my
stream that I should cuz I have a build now
that's like guaranteed to stump

1206
04:45:51,443 --> 04:45:57,105
this going to say and if ass add vdi

1207
04:45:59,439 --> 04:46:02,025
and then we're going to do we're going to do

1208
04:46:02,941 --> 04:46:08,054
Devine ISD Target is CBN box we got that is
he Target Hussein we got that

1209
04:46:10,826 --> 04:46:16,894
good thing we only want to do it to one of
the machines we don't want to do it to
control

1210
04:46:22,461 --> 04:46:28,636
I kind of feel like I need to do a control
separate from the other stuff but I don't
really need to

1211
04:46:29,070 --> 04:46:39,095
and I didn't reveal or python that's a tough
call a man that is a tough call I I don't
know I've been I was thinking about that in
the shower just now is like what do we need
to know

1212
04:46:39,782 --> 04:46:47,453
I probably would say I mean I love Ruby to
but I probably would say python because the
ansible ansible python

1213
04:46:47,459 --> 04:46:49,241
so

1214
04:46:49,242 --> 04:47:02,574
ansible hands down is my favorite
configuration tool ever seen I like way more
than terraform who is definitely easy it's
like really surprised the problem is it just
doesn't have logic I mean it does but

1215
04:47:05,970 --> 04:47:08,085
all right so we have

1216
04:47:08,483 --> 04:47:14,218
when do the NFL thing we're doing right now
is a text to tect

1217
04:47:15,404 --> 04:47:17,093
yeah

1218
04:47:19,889 --> 04:47:24,514
I mean there are so many choices but they're
fine right

1219
04:47:24,514 --> 04:47:32,195
I've heard people say it just looks like a
big dictionary list mcmap you know unless
file exists

1220
04:47:39,506 --> 04:47:43,000
I said I could roll or going to say

1221
04:47:47,949 --> 04:47:53,705
I said it's going to say unless

1222
04:47:53,781 --> 04:48:00,979
well that exist God damn Ruby is so old

1223
04:48:02,334 --> 04:48:09,681
no. Customize

1229
04:48:51,099 --> 04:48:57,528
I think llamo I mean it's as much as problem
problems it's definitely

1230
04:48:57,528 --> 04:48:59,999
for consideration stuff

1231
04:49:03,172 --> 04:49:06,198
there's a ton of stuff about Ruby I really
love

1232
04:49:13,129 --> 04:49:18,384
I don't think this is going to work because
I don't see how it's going to run it

1233
04:49:48,476 --> 04:49:54,960
transfer that over multiple lines without a
problem I can write

1234
04:49:59,349 --> 04:50:04,924
that's a very Ruby thing to do two line I'm
up now they are giving stuff like that

1235
04:50:18,196 --> 04:50:20,104
should have automatically thing

1236
04:50:30,541 --> 04:50:33,350
what is declarative right

1237
04:50:35,680 --> 04:50:39,014
the key to it is it raining in Des Moines
models of ammonia

1238
04:50:39,742 --> 04:50:46,577
I kind of want to try this all an ansible
and see if I could just shows for bringing
up the

1239
04:50:46,783 --> 04:50:48,692
bring up the VM do you know

1240
04:50:49,209 --> 04:51:04,540
is a strong part of me that wants to do that
in the end of the Ruby behind I like to I
like to focus on I mean it's good to know
Vince is bigger in a little bit but I'd like
to focus on Ansel and terraformed above
everything else and possibly possibly follow
me because we have to do is she all right

1241
04:51:07,757 --> 04:51:15,109
the mostly ansible ansible is like so cool I
really really want to get into it

1242
04:51:18,277 --> 04:51:20,444
I don't even know if that's valid Ruby

1243
04:51:31,126 --> 04:51:36,985
what is it no i r l

1245
04:51:52,375 --> 04:51:58,261
I didn't notice it pytorch has been
developed by the AI Labs at Facebook / meta

1246
04:52:00,593 --> 04:52:02,643
I did not know that

Swig stomp spiced

1248
04:52:26,747 --> 04:52:28,601
yeah I need to do

1249
04:52:29,399 --> 04:52:34,764
yeah everybody loves pipe or towards just
like way easier than testifying hearing

1250
04:52:35,518 --> 04:52:43,310
so I don't I don't know I haven't gotten
into it enough to be able to tell but can
way the fuck is all that stuff

1251
04:52:48,661 --> 04:52:54,118
production environments for research I think
that's that's been

1252
04:52:54,366 --> 04:52:56,788
what I've been hearing

1253
04:53:06,730 --> 04:53:11,684
Hip Hop fuck it

1254
04:53:15,714 --> 04:53:28,046
I'll provide assistance for winter time to
get serious yeah I've got probably probably
getting on Hay how that is it going to be a
c e wheel of busy here I just don't get an
opportunity could do anything with it

1255
04:53:28,623 --> 04:53:30,463
yeah

1256
04:53:37,764 --> 04:53:42,600
what's a provision shop at revision are safe
to keep your cards true

1257
04:53:44,122 --> 04:53:48,315
so what are we doing about example as if I
need a variable disc

1258
04:53:48,316 --> 04:53:53,061
is that filing for the second driving to
finding the new harddrive criticizing want

1259
04:53:53,061 --> 04:53:57,675
if I do find a controller and porch to test
you

1260
04:54:01,497 --> 04:54:07,840
wait we can do that part so we did see if
you a memory

1261
04:54:13,128 --> 04:54:20,801
interactive mode I like them when they push
each other like that you know

1262
04:54:28,459 --> 04:54:30,634
I think that's good for everybody

1263
04:54:40,555 --> 04:54:46,265
we do I have an idea I guess I do

1264
04:54:52,514 --> 04:54:59,385
36 ID Source ETL

1265
04:54:59,680 --> 04:55:04,184
say that controller

1266
04:55:07,734 --> 04:55:15,492
pour one divide 0

1267
04:55:17,638 --> 04:55:19,681

1269
04:55:34,951 --> 04:55:42,319

1270
04:55:43,053 --> 04:55:49,620
yep I mixed myself time device support SATA
controller

1271
04:55:49,896 --> 04:55:53,771
sorry i d create file name

1272
04:55:54,248 --> 04:56:02,103

1274
04:56:12,700 --> 04:56:13,856
oh

1275
04:56:22,643 --> 04:56:26,967
I guess that's the only one that has an end
very interesting

1276
04:56:34,220 --> 04:56:36,658
Panera customized storage

1277
04:56:37,480 --> 04:56:42,271
unless and customized end

1278
04:56:42,894 --> 04:56:49,109
I thought my check is again so we have yeah

1279
04:56:55,341 --> 04:57:02,008
it was such a good stuff it's big stuff
let's file exists disco and Fs

1280
04:57:03,156 --> 04:57:05,469
that there isn't an FS

1281
04:57:15,813 --> 04:57:23,416
all right if there is a file there's an f s
file let's do our thing

1282
04:57:24,790 --> 04:57:27,316
no customize free HD

1283
04:57:28,964 --> 04:57:33,803
I find this isn't just have to memorize or
just no way of like not looking this up

1284
04:57:35,198 --> 04:57:40,408
drain fixed size 28 device

1285
04:57:41,508 --> 04:57:45,604
I don't need that when I need that I need
that.

1286
04:57:46,559 --> 04:57:54,158
So that's it so we're going to create a hard
drive file on an FS effect size 2500

1287
04:57:55,349 --> 04:58:00,876
and classes for Catholics

1288
04:58:02,313 --> 04:58:09,542
I don't know no and customized storage
attached

1289
04:58:10,871 --> 04:58:13,254
how do you say controller

1290
04:58:15,914 --> 04:58:22,936
works one device Arrow so we have to make a
controller

1293
04:58:43,745 --> 04:58:49,625

Define the control in Port to attach this

used for my Birchbox

1298
04:59:35,348 --> 04:59:40,948
instance running on OS X is everything on
your setup

1299
04:59:43,472 --> 04:59:47,814
I don't know if I need any certificate or I
think probably say two controllers fine
though

1300
04:59:51,743 --> 04:59:59,024
it's a very different opinion or set of I
just might have been a huge partnership
between meta and Amazon

1301
04:59:59,171 --> 05:00:05,097
animal bite or stuff apparently a good
percentage of Facebook friends on Amazon

1302
05:00:05,291 --> 05:00:10,042
so it might it might be just sit or
something else in your case it's okay

1303
05:00:15,774 --> 05:00:22,866
and if it's been filled out and you could
check is it and your hard drive is being
such

1304
05:00:25,003 --> 05:00:26,908
see you at the station

05:00:41,835 --> 05:00:54,839
they have him something else you're so cool
about and we really really have to punch for
some shoes cuz you can actually fuck around
look like at this partitioning of stuff on a
virtual machine you cannot practice at stuff
on.

1307
05:00:57,911 --> 05:01:02,971
Yeah

1308
05:01:03,483 --> 05:01:06,345
by torch I think I agree

1309
05:01:06,858 --> 05:01:11,985
they look like they're having their offering
all their stuff over there that's going to
be a big deal

1310
05:01:12,370 --> 05:01:24,192
no matter what you think of the company's
that's going to be a big deal for machine
learning so you have it helps that makes you
someone else helped you and if you want to
add more than hard drives a bigger build see
example

1311
05:01:27,560 --> 05:01:30,449
I just got some ideas how I exist

1312
05:01:34,345 --> 05:01:41,935
wait what I just have to do part 1 and 2 and
it's a different this just name

05:04:58,264 --> 05:05:03,034
wait time for you to do something that takes
less brain power like DotA

1336
05:05:05,029 --> 05:05:11,068
I'm happy though can I just say I am happy I
I cannot tell you I love you I'm this stuff
that we're doing right now

1337
05:05:11,244 --> 05:05:21,921
warms my heart I mean it cuz we're actually
I I can see a clear path to like total
kubernetes Mastery by using these techniques
even if I don't get them out this right away
I can do something else

1338
05:05:24,289 --> 05:05:28,529
the customization command failed

1339
05:05:34,753 --> 05:05:41,785
it could not attach the storage because
there wasn't any storage that's why

1340
05:05:50,066 --> 05:05:53,043
if I file as far as this

1341
05:06:03,217 --> 05:06:08,455
could even get there I'd rather not say that

1342

1425
05:18:45,317 --> 05:18:48,610
as they say in England keep your pecker up

1426
05:18:49,123 --> 05:19:04,379
night is that it's anything else we we we
had we had a president and Mission president
from Great Britain ring going to be exact
while I was in my mission in the Caribbean
islands I was on Martinique specifically

1427
05:19:04,722 --> 05:19:12,368
and the French island of Martinique that's
actually where I learned how to speak French
and

1428
05:19:13,555 --> 05:19:32,284
the president would come visit very very
infrequently it was it was pretty apparent
that he did not like the Caribbean is
probably a racist fuck I don't know anyway
on the bright side it's Friday though that's
true hell is it to Friday's tomorrow so true
story

1429
05:19:32,620 --> 05:19:55,151
Kia on the are missionaries on her Island
where the Press were waiting for this run so
I can tell you the story I guess I can do
this so yeah so so so so Island where would
I get very frustrated I didn't say
Australian I didn't know I did I was just
the point that I don't know where Tony's
from and

1430
05:19:56,112 --> 05:20:31,092
we were really depressed cuz we couldn't get
anybody to get baptized in this church that
told you you couldn't go to heaven if you
were black until 1976 I wonder why they
didn't want to join in retrospect I think
it's pretty clear anyway so he would come
there and he would give his fee's like
missionary conference is where they'd make
us nice food and bring it to the room to get
us all riled up to go out there and kind of
hurt those people you know just like in the
in the Book of Mormon musical if you ever
seen it which is phenomenal and and no I kid
you not he he got up at the pulpit and he
said

1431
05:20:31,096 --> 05:20:42,132
I know Ellis Summit. My Max has horrible so
I'm just I know I'll just have been

1432
05:20:42,340 --> 05:20:47,581
but this is my message to you I just want
you to keep your pecker up

1433
05:20:50,018 --> 05:20:51,637
and

1434
05:20:52,749 --> 05:21:48,305
the missionaries from California and and an
Idaho and Utah we were all Americans and to
the term pecker had a totally different
meeting we will call each other Peckerwood
in high school yeah Peckerwood you know we
had like anatolius we had no idea what he
was saying to the fact that it's like you
know if he'd send his zebra so you know the
other weird-ass English things that they say
over there right but so we just looked at
each other and my mission companion
companion the companion of my friend of mine
who was also had his own, he was the mascot
for Ricks college and university and he was
just a blazing red head you know Irish
wonderful do just so much fun. Me how to eat
salsa with a 7 never had salsa in my life
until I was twenty and

1435
05:21:48,311 --> 05:22:15,680
and I was on my mission it I had to go on
1990 to go on my mission to taste my first
salsa that's how white bread I was and and
if in the city so anyway so yeah he he we
just we were busting out laughing we were
like trying our hardest to like not much
just like laugh in his face and he was
trying you trying to get your ass up you did
a good job

1436
05:22:15,867 --> 05:22:24,149
I don't think that's what he meant to do
just keep your pick us up I'm like okay

1437
05:22:24,149 --> 05:22:25,113
does that mean we should

1438
05:22:23,709 --> 05:22:41,742
does that mean we should we should knock on
more of the doors when they come to the door
completely half-naked cuz we're in the
Caribbean does that mean we should go to
more baptisms on the nude beaches where they
roll their top down and they have those
beautiful blonde and black streaks in their
hair and white and I are blue eyes

1439
05:22:42,249 --> 05:22:46,299
what a memory keep it back up mate

1440
05:22:50,973 --> 05:23:05,671

look at the look up do not look up do not
look up that's not the spirit you're feeling
right now I promise

their horniest time of their lives out into
the world to become missionaries and and
they like send them to a Beaches they sent
it to Martinique on French beaches where
nobody wears almost any clothing and then
they say Hey you can only have baptisms on
the beach and then we going to the beach
which I just have to find one that doesn't
have a bunch of naked beautiful French woman
on it

1443

it was wonderful torture it was wonderful
torture

1445
05:23:53,880 --> 05:24:43,134
many a missionary fell to the sins of the
Flesh in the Caribbean I'm just going to
tell you that right now I happen to know
because I was assistant to the president
which meant that I had to advocate for the
elders that had their crotches grab them
while they were presenting his field trip
with Joseph Smith's first Vision no kidding
or or the district is District Authority who
answered the door in the girl with the
fishnet top on with her very bucks in this
like hanging out said hey how can I help you
others and we were like dude I'm telling you
at every corner and then you are American
love times in American that means it was
ticket to wealth and lot of a lot of at
least four Elders that I knew married Martin
naked women that then went back to America

1446
05:24:43,581 --> 05:24:48,425
yeah I didn't have these like closet
relationships with everybody you know

1447
05:24:49,082 --> 05:24:55,583

Edwards and word doctor Professor Edwards

1469
05:27:55,504 --> 05:28:01,768
it worked it allocated a new disc drive holy
shnikies wait we wait

1470
05:28:02,046 --> 05:28:09,242
more booze plays cheers it was because of
you Doctor Professor we're good you were
good you're good luck

1471
05:28:22,363 --> 05:28:29,718
all right let's do this

1472
05:28:30,226 --> 05:28:36,424
let's do Vigor SSH into control

1473
05:28:36,701 --> 05:28:39,748
imma show you why I'm so happy

1474
05:28:42,383 --> 05:28:46,649
imma show you because watch lsblk

1475
05:28:46,649 --> 05:29:03,628
yes do you see it do you see it behold the
greatness there is an IDE controller device
that is the default and there's an extra 20
gig this weekend is signed it and if us
aren't you excited

1476
05:29:03,629 --> 05:29:06,499
tell me you're not excited

1477
05:29:09,061 --> 05:29:13,715
Jerry idea how long I've been trying to do
that all day all right so fine

1478
05:29:14,179 --> 05:29:18,212
yes and as much as labor going to be

1479
05:29:18,905 --> 05:29:23,031
this isn't even allocated just here this is
like

1480
05:29:25,610 --> 05:30:03,315
I'm trying to say is actually it should be
only I'll get it there so we got an old one
it should be omitted and so would you be
okay with all the blocked devices you know
that means we can mount it volume fill that
shit up with all kinds of shit and probably
just smelled like a 1-gig want to know that
I got the phone because I just want to fill
a fuck her fill it up when I fill it up and
break it yeah hey you know how to do that
much and me not like that you know but that
probably right if it's / m e space

1481
05:30:05,927 --> 05:30:13,873
I am super happy I mean I cannot be happy
right now and

1482
05:30:13,873 --> 05:30:16,697
the relatively minor thing

1483
05:30:17,209 --> 05:30:33,345
what I did is I use vagrant to provision
three machines virtual machines in including
one that has an extra amount point and
external volume that I can then attach the
NFS storage to provide an FS storage

1484
05:30:36,232 --> 05:30:38,191
so yeah

1485
05:31:08,785 --> 05:31:15,943
alright so let's see here I was at

1486
05:31:17,855 --> 05:31:35,689
show you a trick I don't need to USB trick
it's irrelevant it is much cooler look at
this actually created a disk drive ya on the
play called virtualbox this major one minor
or whatever

1487
05:31:35,690 --> 05:31:42,768
and I stayed within the scope of the
provider so it was something like extra shit
that had to happen

1488
05:31:45,137 --> 05:31:47,424
this is like really tremendous

1489
05:31:51,748 --> 05:31:59,743
now what now we need to make it if it's
mailed out of it which I've never done and
if I do that I will like be the happiest
person on planet Earth

1490
05:32:00,278 --> 05:32:05,115
I'm not exaggerating so they going up we did
it

1491
05:32:05,561 --> 05:32:09,516
wait so this is hands-down the best tutorial
on that

1492
05:32:12,437 --> 05:32:21,411
make sure to use IDE controller when working
with Linux

1493
05:32:27,663 --> 05:32:33,308
yeah oh my God

1494
05:32:41,219 --> 05:32:57,949
all right

1495
05:33:22,656 --> 05:33:24,003
all right

1496
05:33:25,098 --> 05:33:40,324
I think this is a minor when I almost feel
like I want to leave it to me but I feel
like should we go all the way for the NFS
should we go all the way for the NFS Mount I
feel like the NFS Mount is like right around
the corner

1497
05:34:06,507 --> 05:34:08,064
oh my God

1498
05:34:13,086 --> 05:34:18,963
all right I should we go for it

1499
05:34:20,723 --> 05:34:28,390
which one you want to screw up on well this
is done this before I was like done

1500
05:34:29,588 --> 05:34:34,743
I need use F2 if using about Ellis Ellis
Ellis Bill game

1501
05:34:37,291 --> 05:34:38,740
yep

1502
05:34:40,477 --> 05:34:47,486
oh my God I'm so happy I learned a lot more
things to sew Zetas create

1503
05:34:48,790 --> 05:34:54,211
virtualbox and vagrant provider

1504
05:34:54,914 --> 05:34:58,696
uses sub commands

1505
05:35:00,541 --> 05:35:09,413
it might be obvious to everyone else but it
wasn't to me

1506
05:35:09,420 --> 05:35:16,769
when you see the following I it is the sub
command

1507
05:35:17,480 --> 05:35:24,633
to the main VB wasn't vbox

1508
05:35:26,609 --> 05:35:29,034
was it VB

1509
05:35:39,043 --> 05:35:42,256
to get to the main device management in

1510
05:35:45,381 --> 05:35:52,946
all right so I mean let me see what I mean
vagrants vagrant

1511
05:35:54,050 --> 05:35:59,719
as well as her if

1512
05:36:01,864 --> 05:36:08,464
tututututututu poppity pop Batman Grandy's

1513
05:36:08,771 --> 05:36:14,829
2 3 4 5 6 four five six seven eight

1514
05:36:15,499 --> 05:36:17,504
Apes

1515
05:36:28,091 --> 05:36:29,240
yep

1516
05:36:35,230 --> 05:36:37,142
alright so

1517
05:36:43,574 --> 05:36:45,529
so in the above

1518
05:36:47,117 --> 05:36:52,778
create HD is actually a box

1519
05:36:54,645 --> 05:36:58,808
create HD

1520
05:36:59,367 --> 05:37:07,319
and yes you have to fucking include the
proper case

1521
05:37:14,817 --> 05:37:16,850
that is a thing

1522
05:37:24,470 --> 05:37:26,121
setlist

1523
05:37:43,781 --> 05:37:51,674
I have feel like Star Trek I like a novice
like Newton yes

1524
05:37:58,217 --> 05:38:02,842
set edits vagrants how many vigorous I have

1525
05:38:05,512 --> 05:38:07,305
I'm going to delete that

1526
05:38:14,357 --> 05:38:22,192
Aaron's lighting they can even bring about
adding a second ride with me for a few bucks

1527
05:38:27,496 --> 05:38:28,977
learning lab

1528
05:38:34,928 --> 05:38:36,872
local cue

1529
05:38:41,784 --> 05:38:48,943
242 ignorance is a

1530
05:38:49,652 --> 05:38:53,615
usually the fastest way to get

1531
05:38:55,274 --> 05:39:01,987
a virtual environment running that allows
you to test

1532
05:39:02,463 --> 05:39:07,200
everything related

1533
05:39:08,071 --> 05:39:17,431
2 creating and on from Trinity's coaster
from scratch

1534
05:39:26,297 --> 05:39:28,061
related

1535
05:39:29,081 --> 05:39:38,836
I have to put stuff in my eyes that
otherwise I won't every time I'm going to
get repo I'm putting in my side as well so
pops up on those search results that's the
main reason I'm doing this

1536
05:39:40,438 --> 05:39:48,099
because I put that remain there as well. Lab
is it called

1537
05:39:52,168 --> 05:39:56,739
yeah

1538
05:39:59,870 --> 05:40:06,794
can this be the what what to drink less

1539
05:40:06,996 --> 05:40:40,634
try to keep her lettuce you know doctor
Professor since your insecurities I have to
do the community certified Security
administrator and the keynote of Def con
this year was how to break into communities
clusters using using all of its
vulnerabilities so as somebody interested in
forensics the security I think you might be
interested in that that's something I
haven't gotten to yet so I'm still trying to
get a handle on this occasion stuff to get a
certified administrator and developer stuff
but at some point we're going to move over
into hey we need to break into this thing

1540
05:40:40,638 --> 05:40:49,782
they're signing challenge or sign-in
challenge did they really I feel like that's
selling out man

1541
05:40:49,782 --> 05:40:53,410
seriously I feel like that's majorly selling
out

1542
05:40:54,091 --> 05:41:02,202
I'm not to talk to Bob about that Bob works
over there these days I've seriously
considered working there actually

1543
05:41:02,551 --> 05:41:06,697
hey I've been I've been asked apply

1544
05:41:07,194 --> 05:41:25,379
I've been asked if I had the box is Bob's
over there till 10 Bob is it works over
there I stated that he was telling about his
trip I need to go out for drinks with him
and have him just tell me everything about
it he went he went to Greece for a company
get together for have the box I was like oh
my God I want to join this company

1545
05:41:28,499 --> 05:41:44,318
Sonic.exe of activities America going to be
able to hack the shit out of many
communities cluster ever and that's part of
the fun I agree I feel like that's kind of
selling out I know why they did it I can say
I can assess I can probably guess why they
did it

1546
05:41:44,797 --> 05:41:51,462
doesn't make it any less you know the fun
vti

1547
05:41:53,279 --> 05:42:02,429
all right we're at we don't want to say that
20 GB of disk space to 2 to get home that
would be bad

1548
05:42:03,151 --> 05:42:06,069
I definitely practice absolutely

1549
05:42:06,733 --> 05:42:15,503
I know that's why I'm I'm kind of bummed too
but they removed it I liked it it took me a
long time since she was relatively simple
but I still think you're well

1550
05:42:16,869 --> 05:42:23,507
the river because the kid teacher anything
if you if they required to know something
before you can even get in

1551
05:42:24,192 --> 05:42:38,804
also try Acme trackers like very welcoming
and get overly marketed and you know he's
not nearly as good as active box not even
close but it's the thing that everybody
talks about

1552
05:43:04,588 --> 05:43:10,239
do do do do to do to do to do to do to do to
do

1553
05:43:14,925 --> 05:43:18,191
tell him I left the building and I know
where tell me why is

1554
05:43:26,201 --> 05:43:27,855
yeah

1555
05:43:54,139 --> 05:43:57,049
to do to do to do to do to teeth

1556
05:44:02,011 --> 05:44:09,583
I agree that it is more of a yeah they try
to do it but yeah

1557
05:45:00,267 --> 05:45:03,911
now they cannot remember his all going to
see when I'm typing

1558
05:45:03,918 --> 05:45:11,698
do you guys know what I am watching another
stream the whole time obviously but it's
like super Tuesday

1559
05:45:15,007 --> 05:45:18,059
alright so

1560
05:45:25,289 --> 05:45:29,034
so

1561
05:45:34,100 --> 05:45:38,003
all right so what are we doing here at we
got

1562
05:45:41,856 --> 05:45:45,139
we're going to take me to see it at first we
just need to

1563
05:45:44,364 --> 05:45:54,590
we just need to do NFS so we dive into NFS
right now or do we not do we like go ahead
and dive in and we wait I think we should
probably dive into n f s

1564
05:45:55,103 --> 05:45:56,290
yeah

1565
05:46:08,336 --> 05:46:15,819
alright so what we got here

1566
05:46:29,282 --> 05:47:23,793
alright I'm already relaxed you confess I'm
watching Leslie Leslie is fucking amazing
her stream is so much fun and she's doing a
bunch of amazing stuff with ripped she's
like they're doing a bunch of remote stuff
but her whole family is really fun to watch
she still got their dogs and their brothers
and sisters and cats and everybody over
there and the family is coming on his cell
phone. They're gone so go to subtil Leslie
she's really funny her full family's really
funny it's it's mostly a matter of
subscribing to their family and and it's
just like the central character in the whole
thing she's really crazy fun and she's also
learning coding so and she's doing IRL
streaming so it's just one big happy family
over here you know

1567
05:47:23,798 --> 05:47:33,773
I have an offense even if it's working this
kind of finish should we leave benefits for
now sweet even if this I think we should be
done if that's what you guys think

1568
05:47:34,777 --> 05:47:42,291
I think we should probably leave nfs4 now I
go for that

1569
05:47:45,633 --> 05:47:51,540
sweetie very festive tomorrow and play some
Dota or some Witcher

1570
05:47:52,128 --> 05:47:58,362
if I send out our son Witcher I think that's
probably the way to go

1571
05:48:01,144 --> 05:48:06,391
cuz I certainly can't concentrate anymore as
my second Brandy

1572
05:48:09,280 --> 05:48:12,412
did I make it straight says noon

1573
05:48:12,554 --> 05:48:19,627
but this is so great about this is I know
for a fact we can do any Fest know I
absolutely know that we can

1574
05:48:19,628 --> 05:48:22,729
so so here we go

1575
05:48:28,439 --> 05:48:31,426
alright so

1576
05:48:35,766 --> 05:48:43,267
I should probably save this anyway right
status get diff

1577
05:48:44,276 --> 05:48:52,547
you had more than a pretty fancy I'm still

06:50:03,076 --> 06:50:17,677
the reason I really want to pick a kiss
Krystal by the way is if you have a really
Mana heavy team and I actually do have them
on a heavy team if you have a Mana heavy
Team crystals Arcana can tilt the game all
by itself

1824
06:50:17,680 --> 06:50:22,197
all by itself because it gives everybody
everybody gets

1825
06:50:21,460 --> 06:50:27,541
it is extra to Mana regen early game and
that can tilt tilt the early game if they
know how to play

1826
06:50:27,850 --> 06:50:30,110

that

1908

no surprise there right unnecessary
complexity I like to suffer

1909
07:03:02,786 --> 07:03:09,205
I like to suffer with things that are over
the complex for no fucking reason

1910
07:03:09,764 --> 07:03:14,229
it's like I torture myself with it it's like

1948
07:09:25,558 --> 07:09:28,638
you know what you can do that all you want
that's just stupid

1949
07:09:31,155 --> 07:09:33,572
I'm like the last resort baby

1950
07:09:36,640 --> 07:09:44,779
they're going to split attack that's kind of
smart they're attacking from all sides
that's actually really smart I that's I'm
impressed

1951
07:09:45,931 --> 07:09:49,057
most of times I'll just come in at once and
die

1952
07:10:11,852 --> 07:10:14,264
God damn it really

1953
07:10:20,354 --> 07:10:22,178
yeah bring it on in here

1954
07:10:31,893 --> 07:10:39,601
seriously I can't protect against that shit
I can't

1955
07:11:06,111 --> 07:11:12,349
dead head

1956
07:11:16,283 --> 07:11:17,524
did

1957
07:11:19,363 --> 07:11:30,435
do do do do do do do do do to I had the most
kills in the whole game yay me also I didn't
feed 11 debts

1958
07:11:32,718 --> 07:11:35,195
headed to finance a face rag

1959
07:11:36,608 --> 07:11:44,555
yes Enigma I like Enigma but I don't plan to
an English one of the coolest heroes in the
whole game in my opinion

1960
07:11:45,152 --> 07:11:54,298
Enigma has been responsible for more four
more wins at the international level than
any other thing

1961
07:11:55,349 --> 07:12:08,502
yeah are mid got 011 against roll I wonder
what happened why did we lose most of cuz if
not I lost it and deny so troll got fed
that's how come

1962
07:12:10,867 --> 07:12:18,825
if they did I don't I don't regret it I
don't regret playing it for a second this
one

1963
07:12:19,147 --> 07:12:27,466
it's fine I'm stopping at my Nature's people
know me though they know me in my region
when I play the J band Nature's immediately

1964
07:12:31,802 --> 07:12:42,185
do do do do do do do do do do

1965
07:12:42,591 --> 07:12:46,973
sometime you'll get a drink drink I got

1966
07:12:47,316 --> 07:12:55,206
yeah you know we have a bad game one when
Crystal Maiden has the most kills also the
most gold

1967
07:12:55,874 --> 07:13:03,033
and I'll bet you anything that nobody else
has lost its when you met me you want to bet
me

1968
07:13:03,775 --> 07:13:07,405
and yet you know how you know they could go
in the good players and DotA

1969
07:13:07,405 --> 07:13:12,478
is this this is the fastest way to assess
identify a good player from an idiot

1970
07:13:13,205 --> 07:13:16,487
and I already knew what they were going to
call it

1971
07:13:17,255 --> 07:13:29,639
refreshing was Lincoln the name oh my God
yeah I wish I could do that I don't play
that way I wish I could is the fastest way
to establish a good player you look at the
ones you don't have any denies

1972
07:13:29,779 --> 07:13:35,050
if they have zero denies then you know
they're an idiot that's how you know

1973
07:13:36,377 --> 07:13:42,246
what's the fastest way to identify an idiot
and brand new person and go to and then you
remember their name and then

1974
07:13:40,718 --> 07:13:51,689
their name and then you remember when you're
going to play them cuz you going to be with
them again in the region probably wonderful
human beings but then you just know what
you're doing with the you like okay now I
know what I'm dealing with

1975
07:13:52,791 --> 07:13:59,702
I don't recognize anybody from here but they
recognized me because my name is pretty
recognizable

1976
07:14:00,610 --> 07:14:06,416
I've had one person actually like watching
me on string whole time to see where I was

1977
07:14:07,087 --> 07:14:16,743
wait to see how you can do that right that's
why people delay streams on Twitch I'm like
if you going to do that in Turbo okay fine
if you need that to feel good about yourself

1978
07:14:16,884 --> 07:14:23,135
I'll give you that triple sevens retirement

1979
07:14:24,034 --> 07:14:30,630
777 esta means something it must mean
something greater than me

1980
07:14:33,790 --> 07:14:42,570
seriously this troll just dominated mid can
you tell who trolled fight against can you
tell I'll tell you who there you go

1981
07:14:44,260 --> 07:14:48,988
Nana's river guy owned acerbic time so I got
this though

1982
07:14:49,243 --> 07:14:58,536
watch residual Amber 6 skills he told me 5
times and that's bad that's definitely bad
he picked on me

1983
07:14:58,718 --> 07:15:04,206
6 holes on a mid early game I was even worse
22 total

1984
07:15:05,062 --> 07:15:09,497
either they don't type or speak

1985
07:15:13,864 --> 07:15:21,448
I see what you mean I see what you mean I
don't know if I agree you're talking about
because I cannot pubs yet

1986
07:15:22,519 --> 07:15:27,954
are we talking about pubs for sure but

1987
07:15:29,561 --> 07:15:37,754
yeah if you plan on the team course you
wanted to talk see like band again cuz they
are telling you they know me

1988
07:15:37,840 --> 07:16:12,111
they know if he could you play play against
know me they know that I ripped them in the
fucking do it I went 14 and 0 yesterday and
one of my Four Winds yesterday every game I
played yesterday one with with this and I
just wanted to know they know they started
that should we try that but stay and chat is
like really fucking fun and chant is so much
fun especially if your new boo we can't go
cuz they're Stones you can't play enchant
versus tonnage is bad for enchant ice
probably lose you but I don't want to

1989
07:16:12,117 --> 07:16:21,217
I want to play Legion it's too dangerous I
know I'll play Ricky Ricky goddamnit the
band all my fun trolling Heroes

1990
07:16:21,753 --> 07:16:25,799

he's Mele

1992
07:16:29,834 --> 07:16:38,559
oh ranged melee melee melee arranged so I
can find at the rate the range guys

1993
07:16:39,871 --> 07:16:43,349
oh good yeah razor can back me up that's
good

1994
07:16:43,350 --> 07:16:48,001
it's so hard to play Legion without arranged
in your lane

1995
07:16:48,001 --> 07:16:55,653
because she gets gets ripped to shreds by
and write any range Heroes thank you music
music is nice

1996
07:16:59,238 --> 07:17:01,607
the job stuff

1997
07:17:06,544 --> 07:17:10,583
is a tough one because this one is good for
Less

1998
07:17:19,574 --> 07:17:24,068
I don't know what I'm going to do here I
don't want to do my try something different

1999
07:17:26,539 --> 07:17:32,346

07:18:07,814 --> 07:18:15,115
I have a good feeling about this razor I do
I have a good feeling about this razor

fine I have a son yet

2008
07:19:29,597 --> 07:19:33,452

that's like really stupid

2009
07:20:16,162 --> 07:20:20,782
his razors got my back you could actually
pull the set together

2010
07:20:26,652 --> 07:20:29,544

2013
07:21:17,292 --> 07:21:19,348

know because I don't talk like I won't be
able support in juggle normally I would but
turbo doesn't work that way

2015

that way

2021
07:22:44,867 --> 07:22:56,371

don't want to die is the thing under a level
but the thing that they just you can pick up
the levels later I'm under a level pretty
bad

2045
07:28:20,311 --> 07:28:25,681

2046
07:28:28,094 --> 07:28:33,011

2047
07:28:35,027 --> 07:28:37,483
I got to do all of it it's only 10

2048
07:28:42,116 --> 07:28:45,988
this is sloppy we're going to win it but I'm
just really sloppy

2049
07:28:46,756 --> 07:28:51,237
sloppy I'm telling razors kicking ass the
razor's playing really well

2050
07:29:14,313 --> 07:29:16,676
raising my buddy Sophia has a mama

2051
07:29:26,946 --> 07:29:36,122
don't kill him

2052
07:30:33,270 --> 07:30:36,358
they're all dead they're dead Jim

2053
07:30:56,990 --> 07:31:03,463
are they that ain't all

2054
07:31:04,285 --> 07:31:11,471
I need Sharde Sharde is kick-ass charger do

2055
07:31:12,126 --> 07:31:17,804

out three reading my stuff

2056
07:31:22,212 --> 07:31:29,259
also I need faster attack speed what gives
attack speed on her probably a selkie R Us

2057
07:31:30,756 --> 07:31:34,160
I'm thinking I'm thinking of salt cure Asia

2058
07:31:44,057 --> 07:31:46,771
I'm not I'm not fighting in that

2059
07:31:52,255 --> 07:31:59,478
yeah that would have been a bad tool bad
Newell might not have died though

2060
07:32:00,645 --> 07:32:09,135
when I die three times I guess the
second-highest top-class deaths under the
worst player on the worst player

2061
07:32:10,566 --> 07:32:17,897
play Onyx yes if I got a bunch of shit going
on same time so

2062
07:32:18,416 --> 07:32:20,857
I need a stone bad

2063
07:32:26,749 --> 07:32:37,259
I have a troll noise I had a troll why are
you pushing me to our pleas for missionary
yes go go go go hit the tower

2064
07:32:38,960 --> 07:32:41,022
I guess they're not rats like me

2065
07:32:54,692 --> 07:33:00,067
against Manish yeah it's just fun

2066
07:33:02,474 --> 07:33:07,322
I think it's delightful wait

2067
07:33:09,084 --> 07:33:10,835
god dammit trial

2068
07:33:33,800 --> 07:33:40,176
shit there's a fight one round let's get to
the fight

2069
07:33:46,974 --> 07:33:50,367
we're destroying these guys no thanks to me

2070
07:34:11,037 --> 07:34:12,903
I'm taking it

2071
07:34:20,049 --> 07:34:25,890
I'm a tank it and careful we got canceled so

2072
07:34:28,304 --> 07:34:34,556
I guess they just don't want to fight fine I
was going to have to Stone

2073
07:34:39,952 --> 07:34:47,449
that would be my first phone are we
converging what are you doing here peoples

2074
07:34:47,830 --> 07:34:53,756
oh shit how is razor razor when you get a DL

2075
07:34:54,370 --> 07:34:55,834
has weird

2076
07:35:02,664 --> 07:35:04,217
all right here we go

2077
07:35:12,726 --> 07:35:20,240
come on people you gave him the win all
right I see how you are

2078
07:35:21,483 --> 07:35:28,007
you hate I mean come on that was not that
hard of a kill he's like no Health never
even fucking right clicked

2079
07:35:29,483 --> 07:35:36,988
supports a picture that was not my fault

2080
07:35:37,198 --> 07:35:43,696
I have to do on that was my my all they
didn't even notice single right click for my
entire team and they were all there

2081
07:35:44,050 --> 07:35:47,661
how is a $2 credit it was a little confusing

2082
07:35:49,704 --> 07:36:04,217
and meanwhile are they going to lose people
who do this like who wait who thinks that
they are just say we can lend us any time
I've beaten people like that all the time
because they wait and then it was just too
dangerous to do that

2083
07:36:04,268 --> 07:36:08,036
if you can still do that so easily because
they're all dead

2084
07:36:08,063 --> 07:36:14,965
so it's razor this RZR knows what's up I'm
not afraid of his rages on our team this
razor is good like really good

2085
07:36:14,976 --> 07:36:20,288
the Raiders good good razor

2086
07:36:31,900 --> 07:36:38,333
we win I think Sammy how's the worst on the
team but

2087
07:36:38,375 --> 07:36:44,459
I put a new someone I didn't give up tools
and shit like bad Legions do

2088
07:37:00,345 --> 07:37:06,398
man told youtold you they're good they are

2089
07:37:07,537 --> 07:37:13,562
I saw him under level buy a lot ship Melinda
Lowe

2090
07:37:14,599 --> 07:37:22,253
I can't say moles I'm okay just too many and
I'm playing good I'm not playing horribly
but I'm not playing it on the horse on the
team

2091
07:37:23,587 --> 07:37:25,521
worst on the team right now

2092
07:37:28,921 --> 07:37:35,618
am I doomed I think in Turbo I think there's
a support given to give it to rancheros

2093
07:37:38,623 --> 07:37:39,999
beans

2094
07:37:41,874 --> 07:37:47,730
in Elysian team than the last one in the
winter Chief a China vase

2095
07:37:48,553 --> 07:38:09,622
I kissed her I completely agree I have no I
like I feel shame because I sucked this game
I did I totally sucked I'm a horrible kind
of afraid to fight because I let razor take
all the hits I just I don't like playing
melee in Turbo

2096
07:38:09,623 --> 07:38:18,108
Millie and turbo is like just asking to get
your ass kicked because it's all that ranges
in Turbo in my opinion

2097
07:38:18,108 --> 07:38:26,287
cuz you're not you're not even close to them
to do the damage you know you're just so you
can lay down so much damage from a distance
and you still have like maneuverability

2098
07:38:26,407 --> 07:38:44,751
I I seriously I think I I think Raines
Heroes have a strong Advantage not to
mention they can get work at it or he'll
break or something and they can they can
meet you so you can even get on top of them
to do anything it's really hard to play
Amelie here on in in in Turbo my opinion

2099
07:38:45,912 --> 07:38:51,282
I mean s skeletons pretty forgiving I mean
leaves is pretty damn forgiving

2100
07:38:51,831 --> 07:38:56,008
crazy bastard yeah yeah it's better still
thing

2101
07:38:56,169 --> 07:39:08,328
yeah but I mean the thing is you have to get
to them when you plan to get strange cereals
like the reason the reason that the reason
that like dumbasses I don't have any High TV

2102
07:39:08,631 --> 07:39:11,848
butterfly be the reason that

2103
07:39:11,849 --> 07:39:53,085
the people and turbo kick sniper all the
time is exactly that reason he's like the
easiest right click hero you just stand back
and rack up the kills because because in
Turbo you get so much gold so quickly you
can buy all kinds of shit that make up for
the fact that that your ranged in your
squishy as a Ranchero so would you rather be
a male hero that does the same damage or
rain sure that does the same damage which
one would you rather be and that's why in
Turbo I think mainly Heroes and turbo is
really dangerous to put email he wrote all
the time but they're much harder to play in
Turbo in my opinion

2104
07:39:53,096 --> 07:39:55,002
so imma take a quick break

2105
07:40:18,785 --> 07:40:30,937
yeah I think I played him in the racial so I
think that's part of the reason my my timing
of last hits is really is really based on
Ray Charles ain't even even a chance I can
buy her better than most most my life

2106
07:41:12,776 --> 07:41:18,389
all right I'm going I'm going to watch a
show of my wife see you guys later bye
