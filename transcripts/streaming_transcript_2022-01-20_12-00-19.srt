1
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:35,182
all right let's see here

2
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:41,314
how to go about this in an organized way

3
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:23,161
wow my other two sons got covid to they
don't live with me there in college

4
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:35,807
car purchase fell through yesterday is my
wife trying to find another one

5
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,010
Christopher Lee don't have a car right now

6
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:46,483
I'm like a 50 year old with no car have the
answer for the $200

7
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:53,251
no just how big is a computer just use vm's
on your machine

8
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:56,209
yeah do what I'm doing

9
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:04,015
this is this is the cheapest way hands down
and it'll get you all the training you need
you don't need to set up everything

10
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:10,225
I guess if you answer what I mean

11
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:18,560
and why would you set up a VM server for
driving youget baby to raspberry pies in a
case for two hundred bucks

12
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:32,626
just spend a little bit more money on your
current for computer and put the CPUs on
there and use vagrant that's that's my
current position so I'm doing right now
actually which is a great segue into the
day's stream

13
00:25:33,624 --> 00:26:02,279
again of the purpose of this is primarily to
give me a community severe enough fast
anytime I want and go to practice and
resetting it up also to play around Santa Fe
storage classes so that I can check
monitoring volume ounce and a combine this
with monitoring outside of outside
activities and inside of Curry's and sending
alerts I think that's that's those are all
that the corps needs of the of our job right
now

14
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:10,296
at work so we've been talking about alerts a
lot lately

15
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:15,864
an observer ability and visit you and
visibility into your cluster and Sada
excetera excetera

16
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:22,145
so get right to it I only have one more work
or no to join

17
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:30,124
I want to spend a little bit of time for
generating search so that I can SSH

18
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:37,315
between systems and the reason for that is
because

19
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:43,546
I want to play around with the notion about

20
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:54,063
I honestly I think that's something I
probably want to put in my cluster is
another what I want to put the ability to
use any of the control planes is launch
Point without

21
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:56,195
without

22
00:26:56,886 --> 00:27:32,034
password login using certifications as a
safe search to get to any of my nodes have a
I just something that I personally am going
to put into my architectural decisions
anytime I'm deploying a cluster anytime and
appointed cluster it includes you know
search Publix medicated SSH access from any
of the control planes to any of the nodes so
that we can quickly get on a node and and
take care of it and if that means on
occasion putting

23
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:57,977
you're adding a side server to do that kind
of thing but for the most part they can't
replace it always be able to do that they
should be able to to get to them to Russell
Sage a new thing I just discovered call VM.
Provision file copy of file over and I want
to do that by generating an SSH key and

24
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,445
I am going to go ahead and just

25
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:06,639
do that this way

26
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:23,601
I mean if somebody wanted to change your
keys I don't need to do that again this is
just a test server so I don't mind having
those search built into my thing

27
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:27,177
I normally would never saved public and
private search here

28
00:28:27,178 --> 00:28:34,928
if you know I mean I guess I could generate
them dynamically but then they can't be
provisioned

29
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:44,058
I don't think your Vigor to file can
generate stuff

30
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:56,416
I mean I suppose I control plan I can do the
problem I have is

31
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:01,767
yeah

32
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:09,060
I mean I can put it into the provision
script the provision scripts kind of
cheating though right

33
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:14,036
the first purpose is for just kind of all
things to all people

34
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:40,374
I try to decide is ansible to provision can
reduce cluster from bare from Bare Bones
service

35
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:45,578
instead of this provision yeah

36
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:54,580
I am that's where I was headed originally
but I have such a small demand for this
provisioning that I kind of want to make it

37
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,894
within the single within a single of a grand
file you know

38
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:10,252
I definitely think there's value in doing
that I think the long-term might need to
learn how to do answer with bruising like
that but and it was definitely a better
suited for this kind of thing

39
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,948
well when it comes to vagrant

40
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:23,597
I have two options are I can try to generate
the certificates during the provisioning
process and copy them over

41
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:59,815
or I can hardly code some public and private
server pair for this deployment that's
understanding that this is just a a test
they were already making Liberties were
dropping that do you know doing all kinds of
things that you would never ever do on an
actual production installation like you
would never just dropped the firewall on
disable system VSC Lennox and some like that
so where are you taking liberties with this
to make it just work in a local environment
as if it was a MINI Coupe on steroids you
know and actual thing

42
00:31:00,768 --> 00:31:07,657
and to that effect I think Kim cancel
commands on the Sonos yeah

43
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:25,659
that is exactly what I'm hitting as you know
because I I would run the one command on as
root on the control at I was just about to
write some good information and things says
hey if the same as control then do this if
the host name isn't then do that to you know

44
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:34,683
and I can't even be sure that it's going to
provision any of those systems in a
particular order

45
00:31:35,104 --> 00:31:44,694
and it's not like you have a different stage
right it's not like you have provisioning
and then another provisioning right I guess
you could is this or these

46
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:48,582
have a question so are these

47
00:31:51,510 --> 00:32:01,876
are are the are these if I have a separate
can pick up provision is it guarantees that
happened after the other one I have a
feeling it is

48
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:09,917
I have a feeling it is I have one step in
and you have another provision step

49
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:13,328
if it is then we're fine

50
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:21,641
they were fine we can have that first
division step say yeah if it doesn't if it
is then we could say

51
00:32:23,764 --> 00:32:31,225
we say post for vision and that would be

52
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:37,452
all the stuff image of the cell

53
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,666
so if the host name

54
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:52,040
equals troll

55
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:59,185
I can see if it in this case we only have
one

56
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,941
where's your SSH stuff

57
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:46,164
here's a drink man generator bacterium in it

58
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:58,133
I'm not going to be doing that this
difference I mean if you wanted to do that
if you wanted to like it the whole cluster
of yeah

59
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:15,896
this particular this particular thing that
I'm doing right now sets up all the stuff
necessary to start scheme ATM and it from
command line but it allows those steps to be
to my house because it's designed for
training right

60
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:31,117
but that that is really annoying those steps
are really annoying So eventually you're
right I would want to make another one that
totally stands up the whole cluster like
entirely if it says of the storage class and
everything you know

61
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:35,316
and I don't know how to do

62
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,405
that your joint commands you'd have to

63
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,091
I mean if you set up an FS first and get
that going you can set up the joint command

64
00:34:50,491 --> 00:35:01,004
you can that's one way we could do it we can
actually set up an offense that I'm a good
cuz I kind of want to do it anyway I have to
set up and if there's any way you can set up
NFS through vagrant

65
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,957
and then you could store it in the share
drive and then everybody could just know it
was there

66
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:14,431
wish we kind of need to do that anyway you
know

67
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:19,801
let's do that that'll actually that'll
actually make short work of the S8 setup

68
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:27,052
if we do that at first because they'll be
sharing the same file system and we can just
do that

69
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:31,012
and I need to set up an FS anyway so

70
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:37,492
it's very important yeah

71
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:47,040
yeah if one side the fastest setup all we
have to do is just spit the output to
standard temp directory in NFS and then go
on to the note and doing on there

72
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:55,326
we just have to make sure it doesn't in
order serious with nothing with it multiple
Provisions right so

73
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:08,215
it does hit Dusty did you get your ass to
work

74
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:23,428
provision

75
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,749
no I did you get your future bigger than
work

76
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:13,860
all right Parma Homestead yeah

77
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:21,020
and put that down here

78
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:46,821
I think you're pretty manifest volume should
happen before all the community stuff

79
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:52,341
because this is this is a provisioning this
system right

80
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:59,025
we need to do this isn't limited to NFS like
independent of everything else

81
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,780
yeah the magic if this magic is annoying for
sure

82
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,953
you know what's going on

83
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:16,629
this stuff is okay with attic storage cost

84
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:22,963
what is your thing we need to do we need to
do so there's

85
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:32,282
c n i c s i and

86
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:39,060
he c r i

87
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:53,411
oh I know

88
00:38:54,335 --> 00:39:00,714
Ruby's pretty good I don't remember if I am
it's been fun

89
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:11,513
you didn't do files you can copy files over
I don't think we need to come over I think
if we create an FS over there which we need
to do then everything would be shared

90
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:16,884
I actually needI actually need to do that

91
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:56,486
alright I actually think I have this up
right now so we're going to focus on
manifest right now like quick I did this
once but I'm not very good doing it I do
think I'm going to have to set up an FS
quickly as of Cora Cora Cora skill

92
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:04,967
very important and again I I don't I don't
do it all the time so this is another thing
to practice

93
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:17,503
what's that is mind control and dammit maram

94
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:32,566
if I do last night I had four complete
Annihilation wins in a row with Nature's
actually to still get it published to the
turbo guide on how to do it

95
00:40:34,544 --> 00:40:40,727
Fujitsu so so crazy the secret is not
getting boots

96
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:49,400
they were up so we don't have a big enough

97
00:40:53,263 --> 00:41:02,154
I don't know how to set up in a peso I'm
going to go ahead and do this I kind of wish
you could you could do like stages I wish
maker and had stages

98
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:08,264
so you can like say vagrant up face one
bigger tub face to you know I mean

99
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,559
that would be so cool

100
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:17,153
sometimes you might not want to bring up I
can probably do it inside for some
directories

101
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:30,298
you seem like here are just the machines
again now and then here is the machine plus
like if you want to test different parts of
the process

102
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:36,711
now you can just coming out those entire
sections I guess of the provisioning once
you get there

103
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:43,453
where you can you can put a good put you're
such a Revival in Persian script

104
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:48,830
and I mean so we can do this is just say

105
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:57,541
Unisys you say the same I'm so glad hostname
worked it was just so easy I don't know why
we were missing Alyssa

106
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:04,085
I got to do Elden ring guys can take over
everybody sign not mine though

107
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:11,382
just code inspection tool where'd you find
that

108
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:16,938
if you had traffic to your boo tcpdump for
kubernetes

109
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:24,359
holyshit holyshit

110
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,796
haha

111
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:21,005
Circle Bar C O my God that's cool

112
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:44,103
yeah goes into my second brain

113
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:50,735
I'm so thankful that it for later Credit in
FS volume

114
00:43:54,448 --> 00:44:01,833
I think I'm a boy alright so let's just go
ahead and provision this thing

115
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:08,515
are you up it's going to take a while I had
I took it down yesterday because

116
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:13,713
I should probably start using bigger at
Holtz instead of destroying my whole thing

117
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:39,934
how my kids had it has a Shins

118
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:06,005
oh really

119
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:15,383
did you just put it in a file store with the
push right

120
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:25,849
are using it or is it just a basic cuz it is
just a just a technique doesn't have to be
good kid it is not the best for this

121
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,603
rsync

122
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:41,912
yeah that's what I do oh you're linking
directly to the file name

123
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,263
oh shit oh shit does that work

124
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:01,434
fuck you don't even need to make an app for
that

125
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:13,090
so you just need to you just need to take
the time stamp and then open up because
that's a pwa like that

126
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:21,331
that's like a 30-minute pwa oh my God

127
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,742
did you make it to mobile a is a ptb

128
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:33,655
you can make a progressive web app that just
opens that you seriously you can't make a
progressive web app all it does is a
redirect

129
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:41,923
it's just as it creates a crazy new number
and read her accident yeah

130
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:48,738
there's that you could make all the pwa does
is redirected to a new thing

131
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:52,525
there's a reason yeah so are you listening
to the cookie

132
00:46:52,526 --> 00:47:00,330
yeah sorry this service at Nanny's name is a
cookie and then redirect I know you just
every time you go to it it gives you the
news that the problem is

133
00:46:59,448 --> 00:47:05,215
I promise he has it well searching is not
that problematic because you have already
has surging

134
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:14,001
no it doesn't know I was just your cookies
God damn that's Bryant that's really really

135
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:16,976
that is very brilliant

136
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:27,893
so it looks like it looks like the
PostScript is guaranteed to act and run
after the other ship which is very nice

137
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:34,993
6 make something soon yeah search is just a
link right yeah

138
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:47,563
yeah I just put like a button in a button go
to it simple for the wind I mean why am I
cross the streams is already a system for
storing knowledge you know so source

139
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:59,930
and then you can when you get to your foot
when you get to your computer you can do the
right thing you know Andre base or whatever
you need to do that's the biggest downside
of using getting GitHub is all the rebasing
eventually you're going to have to do it

140
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:09,980
you know I'm over at I'm over 1000 gets
right now and it's it's it's stuff to browse
it but it's not meant to be browse just
meant to be searched

141
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:17,214
most recent that yeah yeah

142
00:48:20,757 --> 00:48:27,225
yeah I mean that whole thing yeah

143
00:48:31,307 --> 00:48:42,389
eventually I want to have it so that that is
stuff is saved when you save is it but every
time you add an extra bit to the process you
complicated so I can't because it work

144
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:53,722
like if you update the Manifest every time
you create a news that or if you render
everything is HTML every time you do it both
of those are both things that I've thought
about doing right

145
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:56,841
I think the solution there is to put a hook

146
00:48:57,216 --> 00:49:06,144
I think hooks are the way to go on this is a
real solid examples when it hook makes sense
like so because if you could use your simple
thing

147
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:13,230
you know this simple little kid if you make
an idea and if you have a hook on GitHub you
can Auto publish that is a web page

148
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:17,312
and United touch anything

149
00:49:17,427 --> 00:49:36,425
he tried to touch any any change to the any
change to that repo would trigger I
rear-ended her that the only problem with
that is this year's that gets really really
huge yeah you just out of here is Ezra s
really huge you might have to pay for
processing power but it's like going to mold
the cost would be like totally minimal

150
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:44,371
yam cuz I'm saying yeah we kind of actions I
meant that I meant that when I said I'm
going to get it back to us

151
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:47,716
the trigger I get her the action and render
it

152
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:53,943
give him some of the cost of that I did not
know that you fucking kidding me

153
00:49:54,189 --> 00:50:00,246
if used to get of action and you're tied and
you use use use GitHub pages

154
00:50:00,278 --> 00:50:05,398
or even everfi which automatically just does
anything that's ever been changed to get hub

155
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:08,782
no netlify doesn't do that actually

156
00:50:09,293 --> 00:50:15,014
now because Nana has a hook it wouldn't work
it at these going to pages and interesting

157
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:19,546
ever know not what this not something like
this

158
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:23,298
oh yeah you better get of action and Run
Road boom

159
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:37,820
I need to figure out where to figure out how
to standardize the location of the renters I
think we need will it has to be supposed to
be so I can dock they let you identify that
now

160
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:44,602
if we had set in that the root at the root
of our zettelkasten if we had a director
called doc

161
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:51,175
then we could render everything in there
most recent that issue 2

162
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:55,538
yeah totally does because you could just
rendering

163
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:07,479
yeah you can put the NN you can just put
that as a piece of data on your gate and you
just fetch it and you naked to your latest
right just URL request

164
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:18,261
yeah absolutely well that's the thing that
I've started to go down that rabbit hole and
then like oh because I I want to do it in a
way that's consistent so everybody can do
the same way

165
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:24,093
yeah as soon as we start adding as soon as
if she's already too much of that stuff

166
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:29,456
I kind of want to put a. Zet aura.

167
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:34,278
Meta or a. Norrell and I mean

168
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:40,865
I start my start wanting to put files in the
root is so that you like a manifest file the
reason I

169
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:52,212
the reason I haven't gone down that path yet
is cuz I know it's going to suck me into the
knowledge exchange for itself again because
as soon as you have that as soon as you have
that you have

170
00:51:53,099 --> 00:52:15,200
because now I have to do is be able to share
everything with everybody else so the most
recent file thing was already a part of
manifest so the Manifest is supposed to be
the Manifest is supposed to be a single file
at the route to that has everything and it
shows when it updated and Wyatt updated and
then other people can follow the Manifest
and if it to see which things manifested now
you can follow other people's battles

171
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:26,094
yeah go run with that I mean if you want to
run with that but whatever we do I really
want it to be super duper hyper clean

172
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:41,200
API standard because then we can share as
that's the thing you know it was kind of
idea and rendering Alyssa we were starting
to enter into that space

173
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:45,847
I can take a verb a search engine when
should you get this already

174
00:52:46,837 --> 00:53:05,534
yeah well here's the thing if I mean if we
get it to render to get a pages right and we
include in the render the Manifest file then
people can access URLs and we don't have to
use get for that we can use we can use the
base URL to follow people

175
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:55,692
yes I'm trying to say yes I already and I've
got a lot of work done on it already like
there's one file called Subs those are all
that there's a follow there's a there's a
there's a root level file file called follow
follow you follow you said to is it when it
says here you blacklisted so you can
collaborate with other people into boxes
people assess all in my in my keg stuff but
yeah I have fun with it I mean we can
massage it into his standard I would look
we're very close the reason that I stopped
working on Peg and by the way not picking B
on on The Keg was because of that we
discovered is that thing and it's been about
a year now right and I really feel like it's
mature and it's solid and just the standard
just to read me in this kind of thing works
for me

176
00:53:56,349 --> 00:54:42,384
I guess I'm absolutely that's the whole
point it is the reason I did it this simply
it was so that you could use it anywhere you
can store and get repo and you don't even
need to get repo right strictly speaking you
don't need to get repo you could just do
something else but to get rid of those are
nice because of the generation of the
metadata so if you if you if you have
actions to generate the metadata I mean your
golden golden now we can like in a post a
link to anybody else's things and you can
have like a URL to the source and you can
have a URL to the render and the render
would be and then we have to ask a question
do we include the readme.md files with the
index HTML files in the render if we want to
make it web accessible everyone or just keep
it on on get

177
00:54:42,390 --> 00:55:05,954
I think we should probably just keep it on
yet personally because because get people
can get clone I didn't get cloning is
probably the most the lowest hanging fruit
in terms of like something to somebody's
thing it does however store all of it right
and the difference between that and doing
the Manifest by the way I was talking is it
you could actually coat it so that

178
00:55:05,956 --> 00:55:33,126
if somebody wants to follow another person
they don't have to get all of their stuff
they could get the most recent changes to
the Manifest files and only download those
things basically and if we do it that way
we're kind of simplifying our own get in his
innocence because that way you can fall
people you can you can follow some people
say look I only want to know if they've had
any changes and other people can say no I
wanted if the Manifest every time and see
any changes that have happened in the whole
thing

179
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:53,939
yeah yeah I mean if you're if you're this is
all part of that the knowledge exchange for
his stuff is that'll just kind of kind of
came in and derailed me because it worked
and I had enough to get through it but those
are the next steps is their hands down their
people been asking me because I hit a
thousand that's now so yes let's talk about
it

180
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:59,540
let's see here alrighty

181
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:05,990
so we got our Provisions stuff going to go
ahead and go out to the

182
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,609
see if

183
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:20,872
we're going to go out to the let's what day
can we do that on I know sometime sometime
when things are just random we can talk
about that I really

184
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:47,484
I really want to I really want to put cake
back in the front all I can guess is just
sharing zettelkasten Intellicast in or just
as little as just a notch notice so there is
overlap there and then we can in a go with
that that's why I put them as individual
read me and there's a fire in the San Jose
that you can use the data. Yamel file as
well and yours at all if you want to if you
want to have structured data and then you
have distributed flat file database

185
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:54,491
there's no fucking Bitcoin whatever

186
00:56:56,725 --> 00:57:04,410
yeah oh yeah me too I'm probably weekend
maybe Sunday afternoon and God knows I'm not
going anywhere we have a car

187
00:57:04,843 --> 00:57:12,247
I can't believe you don't have a car I feel
like I'm 20 again vagrant

188
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,268
vagrant SSH into the control

189
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:27,589
we are going to set up an FS over here and I
am going to start from scratch

190
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:32,745
actually have a live on this how much RAM do
I have

191
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:39,606
is a 16 your check though

192
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:54,741
yeah I allocated to dig around to each thing
so 246 right now I'm pretty I'm under pretty
tight Ram pressure I don't think I can do
much more than what I'm doing right now

193
00:57:56,721 --> 00:58:02,128
so yeah like I'm using 10-gig

194
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:08,398
a 15 gig and that's that's with three
provision vm's at 2 gave each

195
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:15,241
something I learned about me I'm just
recently this last week go from talking to
people to know more than me is

196
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:26,590
the ram is the one thing that's going to
limit the number of Verso machines you have
more than anything else you can
over-provision CPU but you cannot
over-provision Ram

197
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:33,220
it actually makes me wonder if how much RAM
I can add to this particular machine

198
00:58:33,531 --> 00:58:41,770
because I I think I think I might jack up
the round a lot so that I can have multiple
the ends more than just three beings running

199
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:47,246
is Hebrew like a 4 gigahertz

200
00:58:52,100 --> 00:59:01,185
gaming system i7 are we go 8 cores at 4.7
GHz is freeze pretty fast see if you

201
00:59:01,474 --> 00:59:08,271
Governor 28 yeah tricked out with rims

202
00:59:08,698 --> 00:59:10,672
of course you would

203
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:19,177
My Bologna but it's not great and chunky
chunky I don't I don't know if I want to do
that but

204
00:59:19,178 --> 00:59:22,513
has Metallica man looks so cool

205
00:59:22,513 --> 00:59:27,336
it's only call Bosch top so much tell me
about it on the stream pretty cool huh

206
00:59:27,462 --> 00:59:35,648
it's called Bass Shop has been reinvented in
in Rust and go and there's like one of her
what everybody likes

207
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:43,005
awesome flutter my quick thoughts on flutter
or

208
00:59:43,005 --> 00:59:49,700
you should do it if you're doing mobile
native app development you need to learn it

209
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:58,002
Isaiah 7 yep yes

210
00:59:58,002 --> 01:00:13,068
this is The Fantasticks it's impossible to
please games pretty well when I don't have
all my DMs on Twitter with 32GB to CPU
Ravenna running yesterday and it was not
good while streaming

211
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:18,253
and who is not good it was definitely not
good

212
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:23,365
I forgot to go on stage with just going to
give me a second here

213
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:26,914
start the stage

214
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:39,914
there's a station just cords people come in
and talk to me too but mostly I need to
focus

215
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:58,106
so I know and I complain about Papa's but
I'm going to change anytime soon because I
just need to get shit done and I want to be
able to play games then it just works right
now until it doesn't it's not it's not
annoying enough to throw out

216
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:04,723
I just want to reimage myI just want to
reimage my system I really don't I do not
ready for you

217
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,570
n f s n f s it is

218
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:20,418
I have an entire thing on an FS a whole Lab
I did on it so I'm going to go read my notes
on it

219
01:01:24,356 --> 01:01:25,967
I thought I did

220
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:38,662
I make Labs every time I learn something and
make a laugh about it so has all my notes
and scribbles and failures and everything in
there and then I it's kind of a contained
and searchable

221
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:46,836
of all the systems if also seems silly to
configure anything need to

222
01:01:50,184 --> 01:02:28,650
that's why I want to just do this once and
get it covered and then I will never have to
you can you imagine how amazing is going to
be I am already so excited I was like having
dreams about it last night because I can I
can provision communities like that like a
real kubernetes block instance and anytime I
want to fuck with a different. He's sitting
or something like that or play with an
offense or or install a sink externally and
then send in my single alerts you know from
you even if it's only thing is running
Docker compose then it from I think I can
actually call out to it and made from fresh
containers to do a single calls I can do
everything I can to know if anything I want
with your daddy's I'm so excited

223
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:36,055
and people like yeah welcome to the party so
loved answer the workstations

224
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:40,361
and if sfsf timers

225
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:47,952
yeah it was an FS was not was not a friend
Center in my dreams but I could have swore I
did a

226
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:49,649
yeah

227
01:02:52,964 --> 01:03:01,899
if you see kind of local and if that's
that's about this is a fail that was a we
did it but that that was not

228
01:03:02,351 --> 01:03:09,275
that this is what led me to do what I'm
doing now kind kind of you know isn't good
enough

229
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:15,034
I kind of it just isn't it's not good enough

230
01:03:15,264 --> 01:03:22,416
peanut yellow this is me practicing my TV
mounts

231
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:29,749
is episode

232
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:49,403
well if it's set up a set up a ticket system
I bet that's exactly the kind of thing that
we have to sow and if this is the quickest
way to set up you know never attached
storage

233
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:58,098
for something and it's even if it's a pain
in the ass and everybody agrees it's not the
best way to go

234
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:06,483
so install NFS benefits Colonel sir it which
is a weird name but that's how you get it

235
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:12,154
all right so this is why I'm doing this cuz
I got if I got to remember my myself out of
probation this

236
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:15,200
Siri what's your dash

237
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:23,630
I want to get so good at sitting in a fess
up I don't even have to think about it I
just just just happens

238
01:04:23,803 --> 01:04:30,470
young yes yes dog shit

239
01:04:31,272 --> 01:04:38,136
Young I have probably go look for a whole
thing on this

240
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:49,613
lemon FS storage management utils

241
01:04:57,918 --> 01:05:00,216
on

242
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:09,512
I don't want to configure I want install it

243
01:05:11,785 --> 01:05:14,950
I can read hat

244
01:05:21,014 --> 01:05:25,810
and she exports I don't worry about that 10
how to install

245
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:39,199
I sent to my state I think

246
01:05:42,557 --> 01:05:44,366
I don't even know that

247
01:05:54,104 --> 01:05:56,597
and then that's just another reason to do it

248
01:06:01,595 --> 01:06:05,769
it's like if you're in a fishing bait stores
that sell then they already

249
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:17,932
nfsu tills the NFS server packages on
redhead

250
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:32,193
yeah I don't want to do that I'm sick and I
am I made a really good decision last week
all of my kubernetes work is on redhead
systems

251
01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:44,287
and I'm really glad because it's some of the
stuff is this stuff's already there I don't
think it like right now but it just works
and I'm really glad about that decision
really happy I made that decision

252
01:06:47,752 --> 01:06:51,986
nfsu tells

253
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:57,779
and start enable and if is Sir and if it's
utils is the name of the package parent Lee

254
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:04,597
it pops up with that in my provisioning OCC

255
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:14,993
I'm starting to enable an FS server service
why they call it or PC by never received
mine has an extra part of it yeah

256
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:31,929
provision n f s

257
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:09,106
you better necklace and we're fine for you
until now

258
01:08:10,034 --> 01:08:11,836
what does that mean

259
01:08:22,989 --> 01:08:30,789
I am running pop OS I am but I am
provisioning the stuff to run

260
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:38,056
on my my my environment is going to be

261
01:08:38,186 --> 01:08:40,387
not that

262
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:48,432
as this record is interesting

263
01:09:22,215 --> 01:09:24,680
222

264
01:09:32,848 --> 01:09:35,624
I actually don't need to do that but
whatever

265
01:09:51,518 --> 01:09:55,571
I want that to be in there all right

266
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:12,706
we can move this out into another thing
later alright so we need to do in FS

267
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:25,091
all right

268
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:33,034
sudo yum install nfsu tails

269
01:10:37,303 --> 01:10:38,891
and

270
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:45,913
I see we

271
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:56,895
we have individual hostnames now so then
we're good we have to have that that's a
really important then what then start the
NFS service

272
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:11,049
this is why I have to know how to script to
do this job X1 again at this year's

273
01:11:11,923 --> 01:11:21,889
I have a greater percent of those surveyed
are two ways manually adding experts file
using the ex-wife s utility command line I
did not know about export of us utility

274
01:11:25,337 --> 01:11:32,938
maintain table of export in Access file
systems I have a ceramic tea table Etc

275
01:11:36,036 --> 01:11:39,752
nice I do not remember any of that

276
01:11:42,517 --> 01:11:59,637
Central Transport cigarettes fell out like
lights are ignored start a line with hashtag
backslash to rap if I should be on sale
online space characters if any list of
authorized hosts have to be mentioned at for
the office for each of the house should be
placed parentheses directly after those they
didn't fire

277
01:12:00,736 --> 01:12:03,019
it's in the experts file

278
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:09,691
I guess I might be able this is relatively
easy

279
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:23,877
I was blocked group will take a second we
will take a secondary disc of your passing
20 GB a Titian this just to create a file
system on it to use as an NFL share

280
01:12:25,071 --> 01:12:27,228
secondary disk

281
01:12:27,714 --> 01:12:33,286
and Princess Anna sister going to file
system on it she's has an NFL sure

282
01:12:37,244 --> 01:12:42,552
I wonder I wonder if I could Frisian extra
volume

283
01:12:42,827 --> 01:12:46,763
I know I can see you forgot how to do it

284
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:53,417
cuz yeah uh oh

285
01:12:54,482 --> 01:12:57,100
same team, few hours

286
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:05,231
are you at all that's tricky well that's a
have fun

287
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:13,514
that's a tough one have you tried talking to
him

288
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:26,920
may I wouldn't be afraid of talking to
people doing the interview and say I'm on
call that week

289
01:13:27,342 --> 01:14:08,121
I would respect that if you told me that if
I were interviewing you at the interview
gets pissed off by you asking to reschedule
because you're on calling you're doing being
a responsible employee then that's more of a
red flag about your employer a potential
employer the person interviewing you is
actually a good chance to check to check
them out if you say hey I'm sorry I'm on
called that week any other week is fine I
can take it out but that week I'm on call
and I'm unavailable negem Venegas I don't
know I got this guy is so useful and valued
by his current employer we should probably
do what he asks and give him more money for
them

290
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,399
I don't know what I mean

291
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:23,561
call somebody to sponsor me I get up thank
you for that I got a new $2 a month deposit
is used to say Jesus welcome thank you I see
that you're in there

292
01:14:24,495 --> 01:14:35,952
I see you're there thank you so much for the
sponsorship on GitHub I wish I could notify
you know what I'm going to make a plug that
does that it says notify you Avenue get him
sponsor I'm going to put that in my
streamelements

293
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:43,888
thank you very much for that I just it's
another reason for me to keep my email up
because it's only when I get notified on
those things

294
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:52,499
alright alright alright alright so we were
making volumes

295
01:14:53,699 --> 01:15:00,833
are you can make a Des Moines mall by itself
problem is is how do I mount it

296
01:15:00,004 --> 01:15:07,672
and have a system know about it and vagrant
this I do not know Anthony

297
01:15:11,894 --> 01:15:18,163
hey I can have an if statement in here yeah

298
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:21,846
I can have an if statement in here

299
01:15:22,414 --> 01:15:29,790
that provisions and extra drive as an NFS
Mount and then have it be controlled by
control

300
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:33,575
is that makes sense I think

301
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:43,302
will take a secondary disk with capacity of
20 GB and partition this this to create a
file system on it to use as an NFS share

302
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:51,153
secondary disk and when we see him

303
01:15:53,110 --> 01:16:00,601
I'll see that so say and I don't want them
all to have extra discs

304
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:03,500
I just want control to have extra discs

305
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,364
I think that's the way to do that

306
01:16:28,115 --> 01:16:30,832
we need a statement here that says

307
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:36,611
you know if it's a good thing then do
another thing

308
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:47,114
if my IDs Emissary I have no idea

309
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,263
it's been so long

310
01:16:56,193 --> 01:16:58,348
beginner's guide to Ruby

311
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:13,297
if name

312
01:17:15,556 --> 01:17:17,346
equals

313
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:29,703
troll then what

314
01:17:35,045 --> 01:17:38,084
I'll give it an extra 10 GB.

315
01:17:44,396 --> 01:17:46,649
I'll give it a secondary

316
01:17:53,657 --> 01:17:56,856
I don't know what that's going to do this
try it

317
01:17:57,614 --> 01:18:04,234
I had the foresight to just know that's the
Destroyer situation yeah

318
01:18:04,234 --> 01:18:11,473
you take a little while for this base still
faster than it would take if I didn't did do
you want to destroy no to

319
01:18:14,693 --> 01:18:22,505
no no

320
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:29,652
yes vagrants up

321
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:34,092
I can say they're the ones are already there
I'm hoping

322
01:18:40,098 --> 01:18:42,785
I asked for the acceleration

323
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:50,251
work is good

324
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:57,565
Elmo Lennox 80s

325
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:02,516
it's just for you for losing control that's
good

326
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:08,304
and the question is is it going to add the
extra disc or not

327
01:19:11,008 --> 01:19:17,514
not reprovision we allocate rebuild vagrant

328
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:23,239
totally different tools design for
completely different purposes

329
01:19:25,147 --> 01:19:30,356
vagrant is primarily for bringing up
multiple virtual machines

330
01:19:30,356 --> 01:19:33,805
and doctor is through dealing with
containers

331
01:19:33,805 --> 01:19:40,927
so the only overlap there is the Syracuse
like a workspace container which one is
Lenox looks

332
01:19:39,539 --> 01:20:07,506
Onyx looks appears as if you're using like
you're actually not you're using the
underlying Lennox and vagrant would be a
situation where you want to have multiple
vm's like actual vm's so we have any it we
have this notion of containerization of
virtualization and they cross over sometimes
but there's definitely cases where you want
an actual virtual machine

333
01:20:08,024 --> 01:20:10,308
as much as that sounds like an oxymoron

334
01:20:14,614 --> 01:20:29,607
verb for this exact purpose you cannot run
minikube I tried for a full week to get kind
Docker containers to look like vm's I swam
Upstream try to get that to work if so
stupid I should use Viagra for that

335
01:20:29,799 --> 01:20:35,742
you want to learn kubernetes learned a great
because you can deploy

336
01:20:37,549 --> 01:20:45,530
communities clusters in any number of
different configurations with different
numbers of machines and stuff depending on
how many has CPUs and RAM you have

337
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:53,320
and it's way better than manacube way better
I'm already like so happy for that

338
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:58,076
I too was a lot I want to see how many

339
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,787
they going to say control

340
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:11,995
this is three separate computers that I have
available to me these are not containers
that these are actual virtual machines

341
01:21:15,826 --> 01:21:18,680
Mount what I got a god

342
01:21:22,152 --> 01:21:26,727
I didn't give me the name of the new FS that
we have

343
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:39,117
so we have the base honest be okay

344
01:21:39,648 --> 01:21:44,801
there we have never move partition

345
01:21:44,802 --> 01:21:52,065
as a room partition have a swap or just
that's what was the stabled Trump should be
disabled

346
01:21:56,057 --> 01:22:01,985
community I think we are away

347
01:22:04,402 --> 01:22:07,138
what is this is just something

348
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:21,338
I don't think we needed to do it actually I
think at the end of the day we didn't have
to do that

349
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:26,614
yeah we didn't

350
01:22:27,497 --> 01:22:46,920
if you stand we went through what we went
through all the instructions on how to do
that and turn it didn't need it the one
thing you have to do this is the trickiest
part of container do you versus dr. If this
is first trick the first got you is it you
can't get container D without docker

351
01:22:46,923 --> 01:22:51,496
because you need to add the doctor repo and
that is counterintuitive

352
01:22:51,761 --> 01:23:00,295
but you don't install Docker you only
install container D that I owe that was the
trick

353
01:23:00,296 --> 01:23:08,326
and the third because the default container
D package installation is designed to work
with docker

354
01:23:08,929 --> 01:23:49,577
because it's designed to work with Dr the
default config. Tamil file for container. He
has nothing in it it's like absolutely empty
and so that was in the instructions step by
doing it already can pick default and
sending it out here it takes care of
everything it sets up your proper users and
everything and and then you can just unable
you can you can enable and start container
and it will do still do the right thing and
we we we provisioned so yeah this this this
little bit of magic was not intuitive
because if while exist we open the files and
that makes a file

355
01:23:49,581 --> 01:24:20,867
it appears that the dock of people by
default with container to do not install a
good config. All file because it's designed
to work with Dr right that's where the
package is about but and so you have to say
no I actually want to use container T I want
to override your minimal config file with
the big old The Faults as if I was going to
continue this this is a line of magic fixed
all of that it takes the permissions and fix
the group thing and did all

356
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:28,655
do that so I'm a super happy about that
because that's I didn't have to set anything
or all that stuff

357
01:24:29,688 --> 01:24:34,382
I am concerned that because I am not seeing
an extra partition

358
01:24:36,981 --> 01:24:41,954
here so

359
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:55,341
yeah there's no doctor anywhere to be found
on my end points affect how you Doctor it s
or talk about and then somebody somebody
taught me about Kris Kris ETL

360
01:24:56,455 --> 01:25:00,836
somebody tight on Kris ETL and I was like oh
my God

361
01:25:01,901 --> 01:25:25,075
it's so cool you can just crazy tale to do
anything that you would do they would care
about anybody with Doctor you don't need. I
need to increase HDL to replace my doctor's
skills as Dark Arisen as a thing for her
that you're my own you suggested but I don't
think anybody should ever have doctor on
their nose and points anymore and that guy
would strongly encourage you to be removed
to people and abused it

362
01:25:25,076 --> 01:25:42,520
in our Enterprise the admins are abusing
darker bag vlogging it is root on any of the
notes and running Doctor cuz I don't have it
anywhere else cuz it's not on their jump
post their log-in servers and that's bad you
can't convince me

363
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:51,138
so it doesn't look like it melted I'm
concerned no cuz it does look like it
enabled swapnote I didn't

364
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,163
that's office off

365
01:25:59,402 --> 01:26:01,918
swappa supposed to be off over here

366
01:26:02,194 --> 01:26:10,855
it doesn't look like it's using it so I
think it is off but I don't know how often
is anyway I don't see

367
01:26:12,519 --> 01:26:18,774
this is box storage devices right it should
have given us a different block storage
device

368
01:26:21,337 --> 01:26:26,566
and it did not I miss my if statement didn't
work

369
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:33,105
this is this is a tough thing because

370
01:26:33,395 --> 01:26:39,845
Vanguard does it end it does magic under the
hood that I don't understand and don't need
to understand I need to just do it

371
01:26:41,537 --> 01:26:48,652
I'm going to actually try this I said let's
read about disc allocation

372
01:26:50,389 --> 01:26:52,421
vagrant

373
01:26:54,456 --> 01:26:59,065
I want to add an extra just volume to cuz if
you look at role playing

374
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:07,993
the real primary true

375
01:27:08,274 --> 01:27:18,849
sometimes it is the primary just for I guess
is not large enough and you need to add more
space to resize adjust you can simply add a
config like this below to expand the size of
your guests arrive

376
01:27:21,356 --> 01:27:23,393
eraser

377
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:33,402
no the furniture this is telling me her to
expand the guest main drive without this
option bigger ones that attach a new disc

378
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:35,291
to the guest

379
01:27:36,944 --> 01:27:44,589
we have the event to get some now come with
right I think my if statement is it is the
fail here

380
01:27:47,773 --> 01:27:53,782
that I don't know if that's true or not I
want an extra 10 GB try that

381
01:27:56,913 --> 01:28:03,260
I'm going to try to do vagrant

382
01:28:09,072 --> 01:28:12,390
does Riley want to destroy the control plane

383
01:28:16,449 --> 01:28:26,545
yes it's Joy. Imma try to reprovision it and
see if it pulls the next thing up otherwise
then I'll go check my recent texts

384
01:28:27,912 --> 01:28:31,156
so excited about this you have no idea

385
01:28:31,543 --> 01:28:36,226
I've been wanting this for more than a year
a happy release

386
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:50,931
this this is the one true way the one true
waited to take as long as you cooperate I
swear to God and I've seen other extremely
experienced can race people on YouTube that
are very esoteric had no followers do the
same thing

387
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:58,331
so I feel that that's been confirmed for me
but once again I'm going to go make coffee

388
01:35:55,654 --> 01:35:57,675
corn braids going down the wrong pipe

389
01:36:03,339 --> 01:36:05,289
all right all right

390
01:36:08,051 --> 01:36:12,555
please let me have a new can I has a new
volume

391
01:36:16,528 --> 01:36:21,072
are you liking the expertise

392
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:26,533
if it stops rather abruptly cuz we got to
network I don't know what to do I don't know
how to teach you

393
01:36:26,803 --> 01:36:33,109
so every year it gets better hopefully I'll
have all of them

394
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:42,007
the rest of you don't know

395
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:52,370
the last two years I've been doing beginner
boost series it's very very very very casual

396
01:36:52,971 --> 01:36:54,831
is it going to get you going

397
01:36:55,129 --> 01:37:09,492
and I'm getting ready to going to be doing
everything I've been learning about
communities or last year I'm going to try to
put that into 26-week Series in preparation
for my certification I'm going for in June
and I don't get it but I'm going to go for
it

398
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:13,821
everybody says I should do fine but I don't
know nothing

399
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:21,912
there's a video that experts use talking
about alright so

400
01:37:23,828 --> 01:37:30,254
if this is a thing we should be able to log
into the control plane and see LS block we
should have to block devices

401
01:37:33,017 --> 01:37:37,555
and we don't we still only have the one damn
it

402
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:41,131
how do I make more than one block device

403
01:37:45,367 --> 01:37:52,877
I'm out of my league here with a red he's I
mean with vagrants so I'm going to go go to
the internet's

404
01:37:54,017 --> 01:37:59,508
I promise you for example a bunch of guests
will now come with her to get some juice
rather than the fault

405
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,582
anniversary box

406
01:38:05,911 --> 01:38:17,085
I didn't have her to box functions it is not
possible to shrink the size of disc weren't
using where to buy shoes in the liver make a
can attach multiple disks to a gas using her

407
01:38:17,829 --> 01:38:24,541
I got bull this is what we want

408
01:38:29,723 --> 01:38:33,412
I can pick me up to find hatch corn to blah

409
01:38:34,846 --> 01:38:37,741
name extra storage

410
01:38:39,465 --> 01:38:46,496
lyric an attachment with this suggests using
you're the best writer the example of
attaching a single this to a guest with 10
GB or should be down here

411
01:38:57,831 --> 01:39:05,249
that's a good name I bet I do I bet I do I
bet I have to get a different name

412
01:39:07,826 --> 01:39:10,490
yeah I bet that's it

413
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:24,876
and say name

414
01:39:24,878 --> 01:39:27,103
Anna Faris

415
01:39:36,032 --> 01:39:43,898
vagrant destroy control and what are you and
already restarted yes please

416
01:39:45,074 --> 01:39:47,968
vagrants up control

417
01:39:54,857 --> 01:40:03,385
we can figure this out we will really be off
and running will have a lot of advantages
that this works pressure involvement what a
name

418
01:40:04,856 --> 01:40:11,657
Russian velvet 7381 the name that's a great
name to

419
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:15,368
Dave poggi

420
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,443
it's all good

421
01:40:27,065 --> 01:40:30,241
covid-19

422
01:40:31,728 --> 01:40:41,442
that reminds me of like home so I didn't
know Maha I'm sure you do

423
01:40:41,798 --> 01:40:45,806
sun Saudia is the Sun

424
01:40:48,236 --> 01:40:54,356
the chant the chant to the sun in South
Street is home so yeah, ha

425
01:40:54,806 --> 01:41:00,604
I want to see Ryan Omaha

426
01:41:01,838 --> 01:41:06,898
so if you want to worship the Sun or you
want to worship somebody named santiso
yachty

427
01:41:09,072 --> 01:41:11,018
I'm sorry Anna Maha

428
01:41:21,793 --> 01:41:27,184
running the script. Is that the region is
here that It Go

429
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:34,050
please Let There be two discs let there be
light and two discs here

430
01:41:37,095 --> 01:41:45,739
adding an extra volume is not something you
can do from inside of the OS obviously it's
like Hardware you have to say

431
01:41:45,872 --> 01:41:51,643
Imma Stay revelation

432
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,440
turn turn into dual complete

433
01:41:58,344 --> 01:42:04,152
shoe all right

434
01:42:09,103 --> 01:42:14,491
please have another one dammit no success

435
01:42:15,986 --> 01:42:22,495
is it that I just can't see it it's a box
but it's a box devices should be there right
now

436
01:42:28,918 --> 01:42:33,381
I don't know what's going on it's not
working

437
01:42:36,965 --> 01:42:43,651
and it didn't give the name or anything I
failed I have failed

438
01:42:44,448 --> 01:42:51,413
I think of a new extra storage when we do
wrong to do something wrong we didn't do
anything wrong it's just

439
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:59,596
I think I might name and invest can you only
have one

440
01:43:02,975 --> 01:43:09,287
maybe have to put it up here I wonder if
this disk in line is even being read at all

441
01:43:18,889 --> 01:43:22,269
I don't want to get them all extra disc

442
01:43:29,052 --> 01:43:31,627
10th is peace

443
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:41,365
Shante is peace and stability is Sun so it's
probably your name probably means peaceful
son

444
01:43:50,251 --> 01:43:59,230
I don't I don't know what I'm doing I have
to go read more a lot I need to read other

445
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:02,342
stuff

446
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:14,788
I'm thinking we need to touch it to if you
touch many this you can you read me to
generate multiple discs for vagrant attached
to your guests

447
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:25,235
and if I had scored youdo I

448
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:28,415
this didn't work I tried this

449
01:44:32,910 --> 01:44:39,254
what am I missing am I missing something I
feel like this is right

450
01:44:46,037 --> 01:44:47,857
I feel like that's right

451
01:44:53,907 --> 01:44:57,447
it only works is virtualbox are you sure

452
01:45:03,182 --> 01:45:05,628
if that's true that would explain it

453
01:45:15,536 --> 01:45:24,276
I'm afraid that means that I'm going to need
to mount the main volume of control as an FS
mount on it and everything else

454
01:45:26,154 --> 01:45:36,009
as I'm going to have to do this which isn't
that bad that's on the bad me for what we're
doing and I think that's fine

455
01:45:37,953 --> 01:45:44,516
so it's only wears a box I do I've
encountered my first

456
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:53,154
example of something that does not work and
that's the first time

457
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:01,197
I could change it to I could change all of
this to Mel Let's test that hypothesis yummy

458
01:46:01,584 --> 01:46:08,995
let's do let's change it to

459
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:14,499
I'm trying to surprise you with something

460
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:20,695
I just want to this is this is an academic
exercise

461
01:46:25,552 --> 01:46:30,313
alright so let's try it I mean pull down the
whole thing

462
01:46:31,806 --> 01:46:38,843
and I have a box on here so I can provision
everything over too much and then I want to
see if I get it if I get an extra Mount
point

463
01:46:38,861 --> 01:46:46,730
I mean cuz at the end of the day I really
don't care how much extra overhead is
virtualbox from liver by the way

464
01:46:48,216 --> 01:46:56,139
you know what I mean this is this is
something that I really can't measure

465
01:46:57,136 --> 01:47:01,052
after all the hassle I had to go through to
get liver to work

466
01:47:01,106 --> 01:47:10,582
I kind of wonder if I should just kick it to
the curb and just use virtualbox tell me why
I will laugh his ass off because that's what
he said I was going to end up doing

467
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:13,635
give me a second

468
01:48:06,615 --> 01:48:14,274
I hate that that's true you know what a
virtual box allows me to use multiple
volumes and liver doesn't

469
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:20,623
my short walk to get coffee has given me
time to ponder the decision

470
01:48:20,953 --> 01:48:23,460
and I'm quite certain

471
01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:29,074
that I will not be using the word any
further if that's true

472
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:39,720
let me tell you why as efficient and awesome
as liver is on a single system for Linux

473
01:48:40,664 --> 01:48:47,293
there's two there's two factors that have
played into this decision to move to
virtualbox from delivered and chemo

474
01:48:47,293 --> 01:48:49,722
the first factor is

475
01:48:49,723 --> 01:48:56,256
somebody suggesting that I publish my my
vagrant set up so that other people can do
training

476
01:48:56,355 --> 01:48:59,795
on whatever system they have and

477
01:49:01,646 --> 01:49:16,002
if I go public it's going to be clear that
most people are going to have much easier
time sitting up virtualbox by just fucking
installing it just works right that's the
first reason the second reason

478
01:49:16,559 --> 01:49:37,247
is that you can mount a multiple Bloxorz
devices and you can test situations where
you emulate having multiple multiple core it
if you cannot emulate a virtual machine that
has multiple this tribe's than what the fuck
is the point

479
01:49:37,745 --> 01:49:59,735
and if liver doesn't allow you to do that
then that is not that is not a proper
solution because I I need to be able to test
scenarios where I have a system that has
extra space attached or doesn't have a base
attached turn used to measure the Nexus
baseball a month and that's a real core
requirement for any other reasons I would
never use a virtual machine the first place
with this kind of stuff so

480
01:49:59,738 --> 01:50:10,769
that's going to make a decision pretty solid
and I will document that conclusion if this
turns out to be the true so there's a Moment
of Truth vagrant SSH

481
01:50:11,915 --> 01:50:19,853
control we should see 22 block storage
devices here and we do not wish means I'm
still doing it wrong

482
01:50:21,912 --> 01:50:29,444
it means I'm still doing it wrong what am I
doing wrong

483
01:50:30,493 --> 01:50:34,340
that's actually encouraging because it's
possible it liver it still does it

484
01:50:38,179 --> 01:50:45,733
wait what why is this reporting 128 gig disc

485
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:57,122
from this up with your studies and liver
provider oh you know why

486
01:51:02,023 --> 01:51:08,266
because I have the environment variable set
of it you know I explicitly said virtualbox

487
01:51:08,266 --> 01:51:14,026
very interesting yeah I have a feeling it's
not a very well I'm using

488
01:51:25,603 --> 01:51:28,032
they are in default provider

489
01:51:40,272 --> 01:51:42,627
let me make sure first of all

490
01:51:45,568 --> 01:51:52,082
yeah that's weird hey presidents and
apparently they did

491
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:38,222
I found a few likes scientists and
physicists how I don't know

492
01:53:38,435 --> 01:53:44,103
I don't have a lot I recently was made aware
of therecently was made aware of the of the
Danish

493
01:53:45,055 --> 01:53:51,033
I want to say the Danish word dutch that the
person who had and who who discovered
quantum physics

494
01:53:51,209 --> 01:54:11,674
that's the best probably my favorite
physicist right now most because everybody
thought they were fucking insane and then
ended up being completely dry and then
getting totally Vindicated and and that's
why I think I like them the most I I need to
figure out who that was they were studying
the behavior of light photons Niels Bohr
yeah that's him

495
01:54:11,766 --> 01:54:15,735
knows where I actually want to read it a lot
more about Niels Bohr

496
01:54:16,998 --> 01:54:30,294
I don't know anything about him as a bunch
of this mess a computer scientist kind of
people that are that I really like to but
I'm all the scientists the one that comes to
my mind first is Niels Bohr mostly because
of all the shit he took

497
01:54:31,638 --> 01:55:00,103
everybody thought he was insane they told
him his crazy Einstein directly the big
fucking marketing power that which was
Einstein took full power attack against
Niels Bohr and said you're full of shit I'm
going to prove it and use all of it in a
scientific marketing and budget powered is
thing to disprove bore and he's into being
wrong and he died Einstein died regretting
his greatest regret was you couldn't
dibrunos Moore was right was wrong and Niels
Bohr just quietly one

498
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:03,008
I just I really that's why I like him so
much

499
01:55:06,071 --> 01:55:14,293
Roy system isn't working for 7 Robin I have
to go outside I have to do something else I
have to force myself to do something else
away

500
01:55:14,457 --> 01:55:31,267
but absolutely I feel like I'm in prison
this is my prison right here is a stupid
fucking apartment why you think I might wear
so motivated to buy another car because I
don't got got in the shop because we got
rear-ended by a semi my wife on a slowly
thank God

501
01:55:31,514 --> 01:55:38,821
so then I can get out of here and get out of
here and go walk around I actually was like
so many people I don't like

502
01:55:38,822 --> 01:55:50,657
I like control and like working with
computers by the way I really love it I like
Simon plumbing problems but it's not built
in to be more of an outdoors person and so
I've had to come to terms that the very very
hard

503
01:55:54,138 --> 01:55:57,519
good answer he actually no shit

504
01:55:58,808 --> 01:56:15,545
yeah there's actually really great
documentary on that I mean it's it's very
sensationalised for the sake of the other,
if you were on Netflix or prime I think it
is Amazon Prime but it was a win in the
quantum and then it got into it it was
really cool

505
01:56:16,211 --> 01:56:27,301
I wish I knew his name now they'll remember
his name or that's why I like Barb workout
you know you got shit on

506
01:56:30,283 --> 01:56:39,713
I really miss my bicycle Community officer
about yo yeah me too oh God yeah I wish I
could do that I did that for 20 years

507
01:56:39,713 --> 01:56:47,470
no I did it it felt like I did it for why
were you so frightened so that's three years
in and I can do it for 3 years

508
01:56:47,471 --> 01:57:00,655
and after that I just work from home I work
from home for 25 years after that or the
twenty or so after that from always the
difference is I don't have my bike with me
because his fucking apartment is there
supposed to be transitioning to a house and
now we're stuck here

509
01:57:00,658 --> 01:57:10,645
Tesla summer rain is crazy yeah he's a super
popular it's like it's like it's like it's
like all the hackers loving Che Guevara was
awesome but he was also

510
01:57:10,647 --> 01:57:16,189
not awesome she's a he still wanted some of
the shirts

511
01:57:16,939 --> 01:57:33,111
at my favorite are the I like it on the song
Heroes Immokalee is like a really big fear
Sciences II you guys rented. I DM digital
computer and then you have all that the
people in this shit in there have you rent a
Fanta have you read the innovators

512
01:57:35,331 --> 01:57:44,855
I'm only about halfway into it I need to get
I need to finish it I really need to finish
it you might like it it's pretty interesting

513
01:57:44,855 --> 01:57:49,380
it's it's it's an Isaac since it's about the
right decisions

514
01:57:49,380 --> 01:58:07,352
is it supposed to always wanted to make you
says it's like a book that covers a lot of
innovators who makes fantastic but he's done
some of the things as well he's writing his
and research is just so phenomenal it's it's
a

515
01:58:09,088 --> 01:58:14,860
I've been tempted I've been actually I've
been tempted to read this one on stream

516
01:58:14,861 --> 01:58:21,564
the innovators Walter Isaacson so he goes
through everybody touring and all this the
reason I really love it

517
01:58:20,347 --> 01:58:30,233
the reason I really love it though is he
covers a bunch of like unsung heroes that
were literally working as front room you
know when makgeolli came around and still

518
01:58:30,759 --> 01:58:38,571
oh you're going to love it if you like this
kind of his sister and stuff Paul Erdos I
don't know about Paul I'm not bad good

519
01:58:44,503 --> 01:59:00,264
well ready for the Philippines I don't know
about that makes me want to read about it I
love biographies by the way. Turning is King
he definitely is I was going to say to ring
and that's when I went to check my computer
scientists returning is

520
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:45,637
yeah he's definitely up there of course but
you know I think babbage's entertaining the
whole the whole day after they both got
there like Silicon Valley mentality before
there was Silicon Valley mentality they had
like start of sickness before there was a
star of sickness thing so if you can't do
anything without me I'm your I am I am your
shining Beacon it's so good that the
correspondence between Babbage and Ada and
it is like I'm not coming to work for you
and less you put me as credit in this and
you suck without me you know you need me
every time everybody thinks it'll ever see
that picture of her and that nice pretty
dress cuz she's the daughter of Lord Byron
right now she's a badass but she was also

521
01:59:45,936 --> 01:59:48,380
very not polite

522
01:59:50,377 --> 02:00:16,100
if you're both such people draw quickly I
did they draw conclusions about you know
which historical figures from the picture
and then they they don't even I didn't even
get it they were Babbage Babbage and Aiden
are having all kinds of shit go down that
was very much the kind of shit you would
hear and still kind of I probably imagined
you would have never been so I imagine that
you would hear in Silicon Valley today why
do likewise

523
02:00:17,373 --> 02:00:25,958
I ain't like Linus Torvalds a lot right
because I don't know he just does what he
wants and he's right and he doesn't
apologize

524
02:00:26,166 --> 02:00:34,005
he has a lot of I mean there's a lot of
there's a lot of Personality failures that
he has that I share I think maybe that's why
the reason I like him

525
02:00:35,767 --> 02:01:09,515
I mean you know he's he's definitely not a
shining Beacon of you know how to behave but
he's also brilliant so I value that more I
would rather he I would rather Torvalds like
call me a back birth and at least
acknowledge my existence then to receive
praise from a lesser human being that's just
me I but I'm built differently that's how I
am I I'm not I can take it I don't you know
Davis yeah

526
02:01:09,518 --> 02:01:13,479
yeah people talked about him a lot he still
has a channel here somewhere

527
02:01:14,028 --> 02:01:19,420
if he was he was a good programmer addicted
to mess

528
02:01:19,778 --> 02:01:26,029
is it okay so we are going to try to get to
see the right thing so

529
02:01:26,086 --> 02:01:27,783
we are where are we

530
02:01:29,308 --> 02:01:35,550
I don't need to rejuvenate provisioning
don't need that I need to clean up a little
bit.

531
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:40,620
I want to need around this is I don't know
who married me

532
02:01:41,776 --> 02:01:48,171
I probably don't need to have this open I do
need these open now

533
02:01:48,865 --> 02:01:51,745
this is it same as for Ruby

534
02:01:52,443 --> 02:02:01,670
at work to come back to the same as cuz I
think that they might work I think the
problem it wasn't working before was because
of the the provisioner provider

535
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:09,493
that's not supposed for Emeryville time now

536
02:02:09,494 --> 02:02:26,638
that's very sweet of you seen the source
code for Minecraft it's absolute shit no
sorry not if you're watching but oh my God
what he would tell you that you'll be the
first person to tell you that it's like dude
I was playing around with Java I was an
experiment

537
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,698
is

538
02:02:28,812 --> 02:02:37,459
not pretty much all of them are autistic son
plus I'm now they're all on the Spectrum I'm
pretty sure I am on the Spectrum

539
02:02:42,225 --> 02:02:53,129
oh yeah that just happens everybody though
name a name like one person who doesn't
degrade because I have lots of money and
it's pretty much everyone

540
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:59,002
so we need to get rid of that

541
02:03:01,309 --> 02:03:06,442
what's thesunset vagrants

542
02:03:07,658 --> 02:03:13,411
call provider alright service due destroy

543
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:21,117
the toy the toy this please I want to
destroy them all

544
02:03:24,577 --> 02:03:38,536
a first name your child that I did not
finish it or not not to be the first person
to tell you that the source code for
Minecraft is she said you'd be the first one
to say so

545
02:03:39,478 --> 02:03:50,231
he was experimenting you said this is a fun
program I just want to see if it works he
just kept adding more crafts to do it over
and over and there's nothing wrong with it
I'm not putting down a notch

546
02:03:50,307 --> 02:03:55,547
I mean he did kind of he did kind of you
know

547
02:03:56,065 --> 02:04:02,832
that dude had to do a lot of shit though
people sent death threats man yeah we ever
heard about that

548
02:04:03,204 --> 02:04:22,827
he had nothing to do with the purchase was
Minecraft or any of the other changes and
people would send him deathreats all the
time he hadn't worked on Minecraft for like
five six years he was off doing that other
thing he was working on right and people
would send a difference cuz I guess I'm
going to kill you because you ruined my
Minecraft like my gown is just a fucking
game

549
02:04:23,744 --> 02:04:32,267
it's crazy I know wondering you probably
already was going to reclusive and then all
the sudden all these humans come out and
prove how much he hates humans

550
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:49,058
you know how many of us are are sometimes
subject to that I would be me sometimes I
hate all humanity and then I meet people
like you all and it restores my faith in
humanity in like know there's people in my
wife thank God for my wife oh my God thank
God for my wife

551
02:04:49,703 --> 02:04:58,327
from your life love you big we write about a
bunch of Santa Maria writing a bunch of a
bunch of mods and stuff

552
02:04:58,328 --> 02:05:06,900
you one of the many it been many very
intelligent successful engineer start with
Minecraft some of them are millionaires now

553
02:05:10,866 --> 02:05:29,537
you can watch that that's that's featured in
the vice documentary cyberwar where there is
a millionaire based on software he wrote to
prevent attacks against his Minecraft
servers became a millionaire and he says the
words Minecraft making some pretty good
Engineers out there he said it just like
that

554
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:44,624
I need to get that quote I need to go I need
to go to watch the entire cyber World Series
again and just like and just like getting
video video clip after video clip out of it
and there's so many good video clips in it

555
02:05:44,629 --> 02:05:47,923
yeah he moved yes he did

556
02:05:48,349 --> 02:05:52,908
yes he did does that make him a bad person
you tell me I don't know

557
02:05:57,197 --> 02:05:59,639
I don't know who mocks is

558
02:06:02,907 --> 02:06:06,260
I don't know I'm a hermit I don't know who
that is

559
02:06:09,603 --> 02:06:17,166
I don't am I supposed to know I have a
better feeling about this one it just feels

560
02:06:17,166 --> 02:06:19,402
it feels better

561
02:06:20,245 --> 02:06:27,513
I hate that I'm going to have to throw a
live bird out after doing all that fucking
work whatever at least I can say I know live
right now

562
02:06:29,023 --> 02:06:42,665
oh you haven't been around for the last week
yeah that was there were several episodes
between then and now and now I'm a big big
enough and I've apologized for everything I
said about vagrant at least five times at
this point

563
02:06:42,667 --> 02:06:53,002
I was wrong I was wrong it was delivered
that was the problem it wasn't bigger

564
02:06:56,399 --> 02:07:10,581
Moxie genius you have to find Moxie I don't
I have never heard of them they probably a
wonderful streamer I don't know

565
02:07:10,585 --> 02:07:13,450
single is awesome

566
02:07:15,322 --> 02:07:21,912
still no discs I guess I'm kind of getting
pissed now

567
02:07:25,657 --> 02:07:29,093
if there's a burning to be pissed

568
02:07:33,237 --> 02:07:37,904
why does it keep making making love bird
stuff

569
02:07:52,311 --> 02:07:58,005
all right I'm going to rip you the fuck out
I'm going to rip you out

570
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:17,620
picking latest

571
02:08:23,585 --> 02:08:25,453
oh I think it pays off yeah

572
02:08:26,763 --> 02:08:40,952
I didn't did the problems libert, say that
again the problem that I had with vagrant
wasn't vagrants fault it was delivered and
it was because the liver provider for Vegas
is not very good

573
02:08:41,586 --> 02:08:50,077
and now I'm realizing why because I run into
my first reason for not using live bird at
all

574
02:08:50,195 --> 02:08:57,427
yeah I make bigger and got my routes and
didn't deserve it what else is new right

575
02:09:07,124 --> 02:09:14,186
all right when I force it to do you know
what I think it is I think

576
02:09:14,555 --> 02:09:19,403
I think vagrant uses liver unless you
explicitly tell it not to

577
02:09:23,096 --> 02:09:30,444
and it's got the other one just got someone
that's over at Minecraft now right I mean at
Microsoft I get that right

578
02:09:39,221 --> 02:09:44,506
very big lunch box my channel ID

579
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:52,930
I want this to work

580
02:09:57,324 --> 02:10:04,003
that's what I've been told I've read that
and I've been told that now so as soon as
testing

581
02:10:06,728 --> 02:10:11,561
how's everything if indeed that is true

582
02:10:13,104 --> 02:10:38,208
make a box of Puffs invented there is a Xbox
a Xbox it's a lie just like for some boxes
buggy yeah but if virtualbox definitely is
buggy but it first box lets you do a
separate block storage devices nnn liver
does not we don't know that yet but if
that's true then that's a no-brainer that's
a no-brainer and I'll never use Levert again
for vagrant if that's true

583
02:10:39,569 --> 02:10:50,821
so that's what we're experimenting with
right now in case you're wondering I'm
trying to decide if I can bring up a
separate block storage device and I should
do I should probably do a new thing here

584
02:10:51,149 --> 02:10:57,457
I should make a new lab for this I should
make loud that explained that explores the
difference the different favorite files

585
02:10:58,463 --> 02:11:01,090
what time is my meeting

586
02:11:13,069 --> 02:11:17,995
all right I have a I have a 2:30 meeting I
have to go to

587
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:24,238
subtitles in English you just need to go
watch the videos I did about it

588
02:11:24,549 --> 02:11:32,499
yeah I made a YouTube video about how to add
subtitles it's on youtube.com rwx Rob

589
02:11:33,095 --> 02:11:41,002
pretty good so far I can't forget I have a
meeting at 2:30 I cannot forget that meeting

590
02:11:45,417 --> 02:11:50,978
I need to make I'm going to make a new lid
for a new library for comparing providers

591
02:11:50,978 --> 02:12:03,644
and I'm going to say okay this one is using
virtualbox in this one is not and I want to
I'm going to I'm going to confirm that one
is allows block additional block storage
devices it's just like a big deal

592
02:12:03,868 --> 02:12:11,531
what are you do I read it twice that says
that's the case but I want to get it so that
that's confirmed you know

593
02:12:13,639 --> 02:12:21,067
just set a timer yeah I just something I do
the same thing thanks for the

02:12:40,308 --> 02:12:44,377
I'm so grateful I gave up on my privacy just
so I can ask for reminders

597
02:12:54,416 --> 02:12:59,926
and this is a provisioning three systems I
didn't need to do this so I got to be like

598
02:13:01,308 --> 02:13:08,031
Econo Tampa command repo so I'm going to the
one in the car if I say

599
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:16,257
I saw the look on one of The Wonder Years

600
02:13:16,566 --> 02:13:22,943
I would install whatever one's right in
front of you go just looks gorgeous looks
right to the stuff that's right there

601
02:13:32,097 --> 02:13:36,389
please work god dammit

602
02:13:40,957 --> 02:13:48,478
delivery going to be pissed why does it keep
making livered commit stuff

603
02:13:52,718 --> 02:13:55,279
do I need to set up a different provisioner

604
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:17,800
I am confused all right time for a new test

605
02:14:19,737 --> 02:14:25,447
I'm sorry I got 15 minutes I can do this
time for new test

606
02:14:39,732 --> 02:14:42,545
live vagrants

607
02:14:46,382 --> 02:14:50,699
storage compare

608
02:14:58,689 --> 02:15:03,332
that's a huge one but I don't care I don't
care

609
02:15:17,252 --> 02:15:24,869
are they grants either a storage

610
02:15:30,221 --> 02:15:33,366
all right so we can make a bigger file

611
02:15:36,844 --> 02:15:43,630
no we don't want to do this video vague
friends Annette

612
02:15:46,104 --> 02:15:53,196
just call it a day vagrant

613
02:16:00,849 --> 02:16:03,344
no

614
02:16:06,478 --> 02:16:13,197
I want that bass no we're going to do
generic

615
02:16:15,523 --> 02:16:23,484
Alma 8 dark Saturday to checks network box
port forwarding

616
02:16:23,485 --> 02:16:28,617
that we can be him alright so

617
02:16:30,634 --> 02:16:35,061
lab kids

618
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:41,188
vagrant I can file

619
02:16:43,672 --> 02:16:46,317
actually I just do the whole thing

620
02:17:05,085 --> 02:17:06,660
fuk fuk

621
02:17:12,853 --> 02:17:17,811
Meghan file home

622
02:17:20,170 --> 02:17:21,211
yeah

623
02:17:24,691 --> 02:17:28,602
vagrant is for provisioning VM is for
Developers

624
02:17:32,844 --> 02:17:39,631
so they can test different things as if they
were on different machines you don't complex
environments

625
02:17:51,719 --> 02:17:53,012
Xbox

626
02:17:56,291 --> 02:18:03,539
wait I don't want this one cuz I don't need
all that shit when do

627
02:18:16,786 --> 02:18:18,707
I'm going to make a fool

628
02:18:34,552 --> 02:18:36,304
alright let's try this

629
02:18:41,517 --> 02:18:48,540
am I the man still there I think they still
are oh shit

630
02:18:49,775 --> 02:18:55,113
tripping out of resources oh no we just
haven't

631
02:19:02,168 --> 02:19:08,654
we're going to kick it off live right now
it's like I can't spend all that time
getting on liver and I can't get off of it

632
02:19:12,703 --> 02:19:20,493
what the fuck what is that

633
02:19:22,356 --> 02:19:26,132
I don't think that's something that would be
cool if it was

634
02:19:37,168 --> 02:19:38,755
I don't know

635
02:19:39,658 --> 02:19:46,342
I don't know I don't know

636
02:19:50,404 --> 02:19:54,544
yeah but I mean when I shouldn't have to do
that

637
02:20:00,946 --> 02:20:07,764
I mean I'm at the whole point of this is to
say that I don't have to do that right

638
02:20:08,731 --> 02:20:12,022
God it's like how explicit do I have to get

639
02:20:26,965 --> 02:20:29,296
let's try that for the sake of

640
02:20:33,373 --> 02:20:40,978
I mean yeah it if it doesn't work

641
02:20:49,282 --> 02:20:57,103
well there you go well there you go

642
02:20:58,249 --> 02:21:01,152
Let it go I need to put that in his head

643
02:21:59,005 --> 02:22:06,769
I said I have I have both of those and
neither of them took but because it was an
error

644
02:22:08,339 --> 02:22:12,005
it just whatever when I can find but I
didn't know that

645
02:22:12,678 --> 02:22:16,799
so then I got this

646
02:22:28,743 --> 02:22:32,926
yeah watch him you want to see something
cool check this

647
02:22:33,148 --> 02:22:40,718
I need to put this command I'm going to run
it with a run this command in vim and
replace it with the output of the command

648
02:22:40,999 --> 02:22:52,705
without doing any cutting and pasting you're
ready so bang bang that's the filter command
to send a current line to the command line
she'll run it in bash and replace it with
its output

649
02:22:56,561 --> 02:23:02,467
damn it's too smart for me is too smart for
a God damn it

650
02:23:05,117 --> 02:23:09,523
that's right again but not like it did let's
just let's say

651
02:23:12,439 --> 02:23:20,237
and every time I make a big deal about
something it doesn't work so fuck that
everybody they turn up

652
02:23:21,949 --> 02:23:29,271
Idaho I got delivered but I'm trying to tell
you is you can actually run shit apparently
vagrant is too smart for me

653
02:23:34,459 --> 02:23:37,583
this is probably getting sense that out
actually

654
02:23:38,905 --> 02:23:44,517
so this particular case is going to be the
hard way

655
02:23:45,058 --> 02:23:50,558
I'm going down here and use this

656
02:24:02,988 --> 02:24:10,112
I did destroy the Box I did this red

657
02:24:11,468 --> 02:24:25,254
and sacrifice makes your birthday I just
read it many many times I halted it I
destroyed it I did all that it didn't do it
so the reason is right here vagrant could
not detect virtualbox another was virtualbox
is it installed have a feeling this is the
reason I have a confirm yet

658
02:24:25,651 --> 02:24:31,419
at 5 minutes okay 6 minutes

659
02:24:31,513 --> 02:24:36,601
Why didn't it make any noise it should have
been noise for me it didn't

660
02:24:37,253 --> 02:24:42,092
every two boxes of cell please find the VX
Mary added to the bath

661
02:24:43,618 --> 02:24:49,044
Remax manage binary yes

662
02:24:53,782 --> 02:24:59,043
if there is a cinder path so I don't know
what's up

663
02:25:00,795 --> 02:25:03,754
I don't know what's up with that really
don't

664
02:25:10,127 --> 02:25:15,181
Afghanistan the call that's like really lame

665
02:25:18,911 --> 02:25:23,262
yeah I'm going to get on the call and I'm
going to go I'm going to have to meet though

666
02:25:41,658 --> 02:25:43,484
wait

667
02:26:32,229 --> 02:26:34,201
yeah yeah I'll be back

668
02:42:01,270 --> 02:42:04,816
all right that's that's off yeah

669
02:42:07,357 --> 02:42:16,065
yeah I don't know this I think there's
something walking up the KVM to give him
stuff and it's not saying it there's no way
to know that though so

670
02:42:20,715 --> 02:42:26,766
let me try to do a by hand so

671
02:42:36,404 --> 02:42:37,915
vagrant

672
02:42:43,771 --> 02:42:51,729
Levert again why does it keep using
delivered

673
02:43:07,996 --> 02:43:15,688
a grant the strawberries that I'll trade and
plug in the flesh

674
02:43:16,941 --> 02:43:22,618
are sinking rsync shit that's cool

675
02:43:27,806 --> 02:43:30,342
I move the bigger in files

676
02:43:42,469 --> 02:43:48,343
big friends list sorry status

677
02:43:50,054 --> 02:43:51,728
not created

678
02:44:14,927 --> 02:44:21,379
Liberty again I don't know why I keep
driving with vert

679
02:44:28,422 --> 02:44:30,132
I'm annoyed

680
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:05,461
can't do it

681
02:45:06,421 --> 02:45:11,660
absolutely know that it's in the path so
this is some bug

682
02:45:12,344 --> 02:45:17,524
I don't know what the bug is but it's
definitely a bug cuz it's in the path that's
not a problem

683
02:45:19,556 --> 02:45:21,717
you know what else is new right

684
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:32,551
ironically I defense so much work to get
liver to run that if I undo the work I did I
might I risk

685
02:45:33,925 --> 02:45:39,462
and I'm not being able to get liver back
easily have it all documented but still

686
02:45:40,361 --> 02:45:49,822
Justice for sister to realize that I can't
do multiple multiple block devices with
virtualbox despite the stuff I've read and
heard from the trap

687
02:45:50,984 --> 02:45:56,195
I haven't think if I reboot it will reset
because Liberty won't be turned on by
default

688
02:45:59,291 --> 02:46:01,949
and I might fix first box

689
02:46:02,275 --> 02:46:07,436
I mean it could be the result boxes like
hoes to I can't even type anything

690
02:46:07,704 --> 02:46:15,510
because papa is a piece of shit power off
off off

691
02:46:16,386 --> 02:46:22,432
has beenhas been released, said let's do a
fresh virtualbox install habitat

692
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:36,286
the song be fine update

693
02:46:39,337 --> 02:46:40,974
I can't see that

694
02:47:19,170 --> 02:47:33,985
it's raining now and then work on virtualbox
upgrade which might kick out the vert might
also fail because you can't get control of
our provider I think that's what's happening
we had that same problem before yes

695
02:47:34,444 --> 02:47:58,175
Halo strips at price of generic Xanax do you
say I'm saying I think I think that but the
hypervisor is fucked up the KVM is not as
messed up at the moment and somebody else's
is using it I thought there was a way to
look at who was using it as a Caprock see if
groups or something like that

696
02:48:02,942 --> 02:48:04,904
Amish can reboot I'll see you in a bit
