1
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:20,384
everybody yeah I had to skip the sea thing
today sorry in fact

2
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:27,010
I don't think we're going to be doing like
we're just getting Rhapsody up and go right
into the Google to the community stuff

3
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:33,557
I'm sorry to say that but it's just not
happening

4
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,962
it's not relevant to what I'm doing right
now so

5
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:44,122
and I need to get the Boost stuff done
before I get to see stuff done

6
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,073
and we've only got like one more week so
reschedule leave that book where it is

7
00:03:54,984 --> 00:04:07,566
and I'm really really really focusing on the
yellow propagations boots for kubernetes
this is like super important is more
important than the sea stuff unfortunately
for over all the time to do so

8
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:11,983
so you just going to see me doing NFL
smelting and stuff like that effect

9
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:15,834
I don't know I'm

10
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:23,915
I love this see stuff but it's we're really
paying for it or we're paying for it in
terms of time

11
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:32,536
I would really like to turn up the
infrastructure engineering time and

12
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:36,413
focus on that

13
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:49,405
picture of the 2020 boost man that's an old
one 2021 Bruce has newer stuff but I guess
you can go to the 2020 as well

14
00:04:55,715 --> 00:05:02,519
I feel like this counters going to change
the fact I've I know it is

15
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:15,267
and this is what we're going to do an FS
today so get your work there is so much shit
to learn for infrastructure engineering

16
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:27,617
and it is so totally critical to learn it
that spending time on c as cool as it is has
got to be

17
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:38,458
a secondary activity I can't be a primary
activity here it can't I know she helps
understand the system calls and everything
but we but not 6 weeks of C

18
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:46,264
so I don't know that's going to be tough I
mean

19
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:56,077
maybe six weeks ago I don't know maybe 6
weeks of it there's just too much to do and

20
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:01,731
she helps you understand a computer excetera
excetera

21
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:18,843
so I really want it I really want to make a
full 18 weeks on infrastructure engineering

22
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:26,550
and I had to meet infrastructure engineering
includes communities

23
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:38,113
I'm trying to think here

24
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:56,116
I don't even know if I can receive enough
time to go Python and JavaScript programming

25
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:00,667
as well as all the other stuff you know what
we should probably do see in there as well
and the universe

26
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:06,385
we should do if I want to see is it's not
even worth covering see unless you cover C
pointers

27
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:11,550
if you don't cover a c pointer your kind of
in trouble right

28
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,322
so

29
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,958
I don't know what we'll do some other stuff
here

30
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:47,613
I keep feeling like I should say I should
specialize on security and infrastructure

31
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:53,538
and then I should have enough applications
development to understand the applications
that you're going to be dealing with

32
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,526
and I guess Tracy stuff like that right

33
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,626
and you can learn the system calls without
knowing all of the sea you can just look him
up

34
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:23,802
and other people cover security they already
covered in rights of first of all I'm going
to do this

35
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,753
now put this year December 17th

36
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,327
now this is another 6

37
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:59,161
I think that's the thing to do

38
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,849
him

39
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:17,597
I mean it really does take almost a full
year to do this shit

40
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:31,452
the reason I feel like this is the way to do
this is because this is the stuff I know
that I do everyday this see stuff is

41
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:46,055
there's no Crossover with the see stuff in
it so I feel like it's better it's more
mentoring if I if I do stuff that I cover
and work with every fucking day if I try to
cover security analyst stuff it would just
be like a lights you know

42
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:49,028
topic on it because I like it

43
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:55,268
how to get higher this is stuff I or can we
not working on resumes and stuff that needs
to be done

44
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,175
yeah

45
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:14,111
if we take out 4 weeks of this we can finish
it by the end of the

46
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:21,713
of the year how's it going to bogus bogus
are bagasara

47
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:34,146
I think I want to do that I think I'm going
to put get the gig I want to forget the gig
over Christmas

48
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:38,967
it seems to be the Christmas thing is he
still be there

49
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:47,023
the Christmas break thing we need to do
beginner boost and infrastructure back to
back to the people who want to go deep into
a can

50
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:59,837
it feels right that feels like the right
thing to do it feels like the right thing to
do

51
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:21,144
another thing to do is I'm going to swap
Securities application developer and
administrator hey expert team I'm going to
swap application developer in administrator
because even though the application
developer test is lighter

52
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:23,267
the

53
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:31,175
knowing how to do the administration so we
can set up your kubernetes cluster first and
then write applications for it

54
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:58,765
no Maybe not maybe we do mini Cube first
because then people the application
developer boost is actually that covers the
why of kubernetes was like why do you give a
shit why do you care if I can raise what can
I do for you and your company well you know
and then we'd probably have people who want
to get going and deploy their applications
get ready so we can communicate applications
development

55
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:03,449
and then oh

56
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:21,402
all right so then they want to we need we
need

57
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:39,133
Majic paints

58
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:57,136
yeah when you change the dates I know I'm
not starting it really I'm kind of I kind of
just just thinking out loud I'll be up again
late doing and coding stuff

59
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:07,371
their official website of course they did

60
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:24,794
oh I do like that yep

61
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:30,488
thank you for somebody finally calling that
out that's actually will read the first
paragraph

62
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:42,996
i s

63
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:49,612
I don't know that's what I've been wondering
I think

64
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:58,782
I started out going that way but

65
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:07,650
I feel like if we don't show applications
development activities people aren't going
to give a shit about how to administer it

66
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:14,677
and if we jump in and start talking about
storage classes going to be like why do I
care you know

67
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:23,820
yeah the library to put that in there it's
probably a true it would be about right

68
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:30,768
yeah that's just regular for the rescue knee
Frank M

69
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:35,202
so I think I think we're going to stay with
application development first

70
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:49,464
C K & c k s in hand without Administration
without security is you subtly

71
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,544
yeah well we definitely have to seek a sign
I am to guess I just

72
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:08,674
what if we combine them all and we just put
a kubernetes boost and we say look by the
end of this you should be able to get

73
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:15,104
cuz here's the problem there's tons of
overlap between the administrator and the
application developers though

74
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:22,903
I think if we just did infrastructure
engineering which includes devops sort of

75
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:35,767
immature treasure is primary virtualization
introduction containerization and then we do
a doctor in kubernetes boost no containers
and communities that's what we need to do
when you do containers in kubernetes

76
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:40,617
and you call a devops if you want but I
don't give a shit that's not what I'm going
to call

77
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:50,391
because that you know I don't think we
should break them out I think I don't think
we should

78
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:35,157
this is going to be that's going to be like
so that includes docker-compose dockerfile
ronettis how to make images white we do with
images where you would put the images it
doesn't have any virtualization stuff so
infrastructure engineering is going to be
primarily based on servers like Hardware
servers and virtualization servers and
cremation container is like just that right
you could argue that being a boost is like
traditional stuff when you have just a
single multi-user server

79
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:45,299
yeah I think that's the way to go

80
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:50,485
like I said it's just going to simplify
things like so much

81
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:55,825
and then I then I don't have to stress about
it I've been stressing about

82
00:16:55,825 --> 00:17:02,322
covering things that are not in my core
interests because I'm not doing them all the
time like see

83
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:08,179
and I just it's just hard for me to cut chop
chop out time for it because I know it's a
distraction from the other stuff I need to
learn

84
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:14,053
you know it's fun and it's just really nice
instructional and it helps to understand a
computer and all that

85
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,433
the number for CK over Stacy card so far

86
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:40,640
right now I have I mean at the beginning of
the year I did nothing but ckad I did
development stuff because we're due for Hub
that's where the whole that's and then I did
services to understand how to make an
application in kubernetes yet so

87
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,164
yeah

88
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:55,777
or did it stretches out of them know I don't
I've been outside a few times actually
that's there's a data structures of course
inside of my and I never will cover that

89
00:17:55,845 --> 00:18:09,333
I want time I've tried I've just got have
decided to go really really deep into
infrastructure and operations and to have
more of a a 40-60 split into a terms of
coding to the operations

90
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:14,175
I am Frank loves to tell me that I suck at
programming

91
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:20,674
and it's true it's true I suck at
programming compared to people who could all
the time

92
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,024
I also don't think it's required to learn
data structures and algorithms at all

93
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:40,004
it might help you as a software engineer but
the truth is I'm not Preparing People for
software engineering careers I've had a very
successful software engineering career I did

94
00:18:40,006 --> 00:19:01,894
yeah if you're majoring Matheny eye then go
to machine learning and this is not the
place for you this is the place to come when
you want to learn how to use the best tools
that are going to get you in and help you be
a fish are you want to build your own lab or
you want to and I do stuff like that he
wanted you want the the infrastructure to
run your your your software on butt

95
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,770
I've always been

96
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:11,579
it is funny because I'm about to take this
but when it comes to coding and engineering
and operations I really am

97
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:16,047
and yeah I don't think this

98
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:23,028
you want to know that stuff but I can't come
to my degree is absolutely can't is kind of
stupid

99
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:43,159
I do not work stuff yeah yeah even in
there's no there's no secret that covers it
there's no debris that covers infrastructure
engineering. I have never seen a degree on
planet Earth on in any country that covers
enter for infrastructure engineering topics
at all

100
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:50,700
I don't they just don't take cover it it's
not too easy if you fucking kidding me
you've been paying attention

101
00:19:51,944 --> 00:20:01,202
dude if you think setting up your own
carre's cluster on your own operations in
your own storage classes and everything is
easy and that's why I called just don't
cover it

102
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:18,351
I think you're fucking fool that is not the
reason they don't cover it the reason I will
cover it is because it's practical it's not
theoretical and quality is the only cover
theoretical ship if they don't cover
practical stuff let's go to Community
College to get an engineering degree

103
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,058
what's up

104
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:36,618
I yeah okay

105
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:40,779
no I'm in I just woke up you know what that
means

106
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:48,374
give her my brain is on fire and I got to do
brain stuff I see that

107
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:57,830
no you and your timing

108
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:26,764
what was I thinking of I can't even remember
what was on my brain

109
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:31,786
I love you what are you doing okay

110
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,483
okay

111
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,634
boy oh boy I literally can't think about I
cannot remember a single thing I was
thinking before that

112
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,191
that's miss my coffee

113
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:18,505
what's the name of your face any theories of
his offer engineering degrees

114
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:26,841
is useless rent not even worth it 3 yeah

115
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:35,923
yeah and operations is that's my my number
one complain about education education is
all theoretical almost all of it

116
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,773
they never teach you why

117
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:48,261
you need to learn calculus or why you need
to learn history or why chemistry all right
you know if people have to find their own
applications of the Y

118
00:22:49,863 --> 00:22:54,375
and Anna

119
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,586
my wife doesn't feel bad I'll be back

120
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:07,707
I said I was starting soon online

121
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,966
degrees out of University in the Portuguese

122
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:30,604
iMac I'm back

123
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:35,094
accreditation

124
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:44,419
I talked about the accreditation problem
before colleges can't keep up

125
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:53,136
if they teach Theory they can get accredited
because the curriculum doesn't change

126
00:25:53,397 --> 00:26:00,943
if they try to teach practical application
was changes every fucking day they can never
keep up and they can't get accredited

127
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:09,270
that's exactly the problem the whole
education system is totally broken because
of that

128
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:24,347
all right

129
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:51,694
an investment banker in the same time to
test Coronavirus where do that

130
00:26:56,425 --> 00:27:07,586
I thought about removing bigger from the
bigger from the the title of the labs
because it's really not about vagrant it's
about how to set up an FS that's what is
about

131
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:18,664
and you can't test setting up and it says
without a virtual machine and you can't
setup a virtual machine I mean I guess you
could do it from the command line using VBA
box manager or something like that

132
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:23,002
to create a new disk cell

133
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:29,874
I got one more day to fix your I need to
move this date in to here just bear with me
for a second

134
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:36,947
Cal

135
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:50,286
I mean this is probably be

136
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:04,527
Cal 2022

137
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:17,768
not the whole year there we go

138
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:28,856
mention movie in June we have January so if
we have

139
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:34,889
it is a weird September September 3rd

140
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,128
levitate for shave 4 weeks from January 28th
we get we go back to

141
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:51,714
what is a Sea Ray 2028

142
00:28:55,005 --> 00:29:02,640
oh that's next year ice 123 yeah okay

143
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,373
give me an exam

144
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:25,328
Embrace bootcamps yeah because the boot
camps can teach fast

145
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:32,861
delete 234 that would mean December

146
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:43,188
December 31st be the last one that's
actually perfect

147
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:50,410
I change this to be September 3rd

148
00:29:56,152 --> 00:30:00,451
to December 31st

149
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:16,001
yeah a lot of a lot of colleges don't know
they don't know the Practical part of it cuz
it never done it

150
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:22,051
enter the beautiful intelligent people who
have no practical application for this it's
up to 13th Street

151
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:43,516
but I think it's really broken actually and
I'm 100% practical too much so I would
rather fail and fail and fail and fail and
fail then read the document about why I
should be that way and that's actually the
natural way to learn things that's how
nature Works literally but I don't know if
it's the best way I know

152
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,788
and then we do this one it'll be January

153
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:17,658
I'm in January is a good thing at at like
this a lot this is like almost like it's
like meant to be because it's like it makes
getting the job the first thing you think
about a January which is always good so in
January we talked about getting jobs

154
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,137
ripe and

155
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:31,424
Hickory for sale 1815 2229

156
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:39,260
I just make any sense a 22

157
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,120
I might have that wrong

158
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:58,583
2 January 2020

159
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:07,388
am I so that's I did this right all right so
January 7th to 20th of night

160
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:14,335
7 Henry 2020 resumes and stuff

161
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,597
and talk to her recruiters excetera

162
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:35,032
what's a what's a Lennox beginner boost

163
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,472
intersection you can put the system in there

164
00:33:12,682 --> 00:33:18,323
get the gig containers Community Co-op

165
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,839
yep and then

166
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:48,402
I feel like you can apply for jobs with just
having the Linux infrastructure stuff if you
just had to learn all the stuff from the
Linux and a structure boost you would
seriously you'd be definitely employable
that point may be employable after the Linux
boost

167
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:51,562
I just dropped him a hiking streams

168
00:33:51,856 --> 00:34:20,134
I dropped the package from just no time we
can cover Security in the containers and
infrastructure we're going to cover security
all along the way here I'm going to talk
about pentesting career with certification
to get hats and I'm going to spend time and
hack the Box probably not probably not and
if I do it's going to be related to
infrastructure it'll be something I do
instead of gaming you know me something I do
instead of gaming because

169
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:44,505
there's just not enough time this is not a
time I love security topics but but they are
not they're not quarter what I do you know
what I mean so with that stuff include so I
can raise security right truth is is it if
you'd if you understand the stuff that I'm
doing you know how to finish all of your
track meet at the Box in things like that
because you can figure it out

170
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:48,035
he actually has an assigned nice Honeywell

171
00:34:48,228 --> 00:35:10,773
I think security is kind of implicit in
understanding that how the core
infrastructure works the only thing that's
not here in terms of like the security that
I would be interesting would be forensics
and that would require require deep level C
knowledge and stuff in and I I don't want to
cover it I like it it's interesting stuff
but it's not practical

172
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:27,266
and there's not enough people to cover it
this is what nobody is covering on stream
right nobody except for had Tanis had Tanis
is the only person on Twitch and YouTube
that I know of who is covering

173
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:42,359
you know General Enterprise infrastructure
engineering topics and go get your 8 plus
from the guy on YouTube if you want to you
can do it with me but there's nobody
covering it so I think the reason that I'm
going to dwelling on this little bit more
into today is because

174
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:45,641
today is because this content is just not
there it's not covered

175
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:51,464
zone 6 and architect nice sourcing
procurement

176
00:35:52,049 --> 00:36:48,609
it's a great that would be best bath like
service stations I think he's probably that
I would if I were going to look I am not a
security person you want to go ask somebody
in the industry is insecurity but I
seriously studied security at the beginning
of 2020 2021 actually 2020 if you need 2020
I seriously studied all of them were passing
security and stuff before I made a decision
I actually decided not to go to security
because it's 50% report writing at least
most of the security jobs professional jobs
I decided I wanted to be Hands-On and
infrastructure all the time 24 7 and there's
more opportunity for that infrastructure
engineering and communities in devops in
that kind of thing that you're you're
dealing with tag all the time you're not
you're not writing reports we have a stand
up every day and that's it but I must not
like riding I did not want to do that as
part of my job so I avoided security is a
career path

177
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:52,710
is mean I don't like security doesn't mean I
don't hack in my spare time I could return

178
00:36:53,341 --> 00:37:53,928
and one thing I completed out of that is
there is two paths in Security in general if
you want to be a Hands-On security is
actually three there's the pie-in-the-sky
You Know Chief security operations the cissp
kind of people that set security policy and
they don't do any hacking at all they just
go to meetings and talk about how everybody
should be more secure and they said policies
that make people and make make power points
and then you have the the pentesters who are
hacking things all the time and writing
reports about it is a freelance version of
that where they're doing the same thing I
tell me what I just did and there's some a
vulnerability so they can assess and then
get the money and then you have a defensive
people that are constantly striving stuff
down which is just sister was just systems
Administration I did that technically I
qualified as a security expert while I was
in a medium because I was writing systems on
its software and then they would patch holes
in the systems in order to prevent them from
getting hacked that's a security profession
itself so it's just a ministration know the
reason I'm not focusing on security
specifically here because

179
00:37:53,938 --> 00:38:18,156
you did a good infrastructure engineering is
security blue blue team defensive security
is built into your job offensive security
isn't so much other than as a method for
finding out what what's week when I get some
money I know I know but I know those power
points are important and I'm not have been
trying to attack anybody I'm just telling
you this not the job I want

180
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,402
yeah

181
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:36,614
I'm not look I'm not taking anybody's career
I'm telling you what the career is if you
want to write if you want to do a lot of
Russians and Consulting and stuff like that
and it's your gig then that's that's very
high by the way to do that

182
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:58,630
and do that I would get the cissp out of
work towards getting it yet you can't even
get it until you get one of the Lesser
certificates that's been blessed by the
organisation and then you have to climb the
ladder and you put your time and you going
to go to years time and on to get it and
then you can eventually get it you can be
you know the executive the the other

183
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:55,289
the Inn in there then there's like the
researchers who I spend all their time in
the lab just like I mostly just finding
zero-day bugs and stuff like that and doing
forensic science if it's already been busted
and everything and we have people in here
doctor Professor whatever the fuck that
persons are usually drunk when they're here
claims to do forensic I know we have at
least at least at least four people who work
probably in some military government
capacity and and they they do all kinds of
the problem with that path with that path
you have to have certificates in your degree
and so w makes the most sense of humor
American to do that you can get you can get
a master's in cyber security for under
$6,000 doing W-4 me to credit University
that comes with 25 industry certificates for
security by default as including the price
and I have nothing to do with w

184
00:39:55,293 --> 00:40:22,302
there are other streamers who do they get
paid crazy gobs of money for sponsoring them
I don't but I still feel like that's the
best path if you want to go into security
and you want a traditional role and it
conservative organization like the military
military or NSA or something like that they
have high high degree requirements for
certificates if you want to work for a you
know kind of a cooler like if security or
one of these firms out there

185
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:56,345
one of these firms out there that does
security you know as by contract they they
they make fun of people who get certificates
and of the only certificates they actually
there's actually a date make a joke about on
the job application page on S security and
the only one they really care about is osep
and that's the one I was searching to get so
my conclusion when I was going to see her a
bath cuz I wanted to be an attempt to
offensive security and then I wanted to
Moonlight on the side to make money one way
or another and I

186
00:40:57,419 --> 00:41:13,244
I was seeking to get the oscp which is
really expensive and hard to get and and and
then to supplement that with you know just
just getting into a CPU will get you in the
door almost anywhere if you want to work
like that

187
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:14,666
so

188
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:36,556
somebody on the Nets that's why I'm saying
we probably will talk about security as a
profession we talked we talked about get the
gig I have heard at least three times in
this chat hey thanks how's it going at work
I haven't at least three times in this chat
I have heard people say

189
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:43,932
one day I was assisting ministrator and then
my manager came to me and pointed at me and
said you're now a security analyst

190
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:52,368
an easy filter absolutely severe weather is
helping HR determine absolutely

191
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:05,739
so the reason that I'm dropping security as
an official Focus here is I tell you this if
you can do everything in the Linux boost and
you know that comparison communities and
infrastructure engineering

192
00:42:05,741 --> 00:42:10,010
and you're a decent system in which is an
old term that so matters

193
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:43,703
you can do security you can do security all
you have to do is spend like in a three or
four months going into the the methods of
attack and it and I also said that the
reason that so many systems just get retitle
the security people is because they're
already doing the job they're already did
you know there are any patching systems
already and I'm looking for vulnerabilities
know what they're not actively attacking
things so that's something they might have
to learn so my point is is that you can
easily transition from

194
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:56,352
Nutrisystem administration's and
infrastructure engineering into into into
security and like it into like a little more
security prioritize bill

195
00:42:56,825 --> 00:43:11,861
how do I get to cks the community security I
could I could craft a career that's just
focus on community security only just that
because that's the number I was at Defcon 3
keynote presentation this year

196
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:17,979
so people breaking it's the hot new thing is
to break into careers clusters

197
00:43:20,735 --> 00:44:18,817
but if you don't know how it came right
across their works are you don't know how
NFS works or any of these things that could
raise depends on you have no hope of being a
security expert in that field he's going to
have it works so first seek to understand
how it works that's all I hacker is somebody
who understands how it works Darlene has a
famous quote of mr. robot she goes given
enough time and white papers I can own that
bitch or something like that she can white
papers is the other official documentation
on how something works and that's that's the
biggest of all is just being able to really
dive in and understand how the system works
and see its flaws are just the security
people are just glorified testers they're
really really amazing that's why they called
pentesters but they're just really really
amazing testers who can see all the angles
on a thing and testing by itself as a career
that doesn't have a title these days in QA
engineer as it's not a title that you can
really find it's kind of sad actually

198
00:44:18,827 --> 00:44:26,647
I haven't searched on indeed but I would be
challenged to find if you can if you can
even find anything on that particular topic
I don't think you can

199
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:36,102
so so nice peter boost infrastructure
engineering and then had to get to dig that
that is the new the new thing

200
00:44:37,789 --> 00:45:02,370
I'm going to say that that makes me feel
better because I gives me more time to carve
should out even if you don't get formal with
it it'll just give us a topic to cover and
we can do it like we did last time it is
kind of weird anticlea let the topics blow
and try to try to make sure they'll fit
within the amount of time 18 weeks I was
probably enough time to learn everything
that we need to do

201
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:20,681
that we need to do it in a festive this
stuff goes with infrastructure engineering
May detect feels who were searched have
little impact on her guards HR yeah
absolutely yeah it was Abella purse
absolutely have no if I was available I
would not get a cert

202
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,870
the me on actively tells people not to get
certs any teaching web Developers

203
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:31,633
you're an engineer or a security person it's
different I did a whole thing of this

204
00:45:34,372 --> 00:45:41,231
I did a whole videos how do I certify go
watch that's an hour long thing I made a
pretty graph

205
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:48,524
it's specifically about that topic so I got
to get better at just sending people to my
videos and then

206
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:54,964
and then not not wasting too much time
talking about it over and over and over
again

207
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:02,012
is it again if I thought yeah red flag with
developers yam

208
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:05,911
yeah I read that very fact

209
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:13,061
yeah I read that I read that from Gail
actually that you were at the cracking the
coding interview book

210
00:46:13,096 --> 00:46:18,640
you don't invite me to another reason for
this to me to Frankel love this

211
00:46:20,692 --> 00:46:50,772
you know it's a different world to get to
get a purely software engineering
programming job is 100% different career
path then going into operations it's totally
different the way you get the job the the
type of things you have to do to create
trust so when I reasons you're seeing me
kind of shift away and it's I mean you know
Frank says I'm a horrible program or well
you know I am so

212
00:46:50,774 --> 00:47:00,832
you know I'm playing good I can get if I
have had programming jobs where I have made
you know well well into the six-figure range
and

213
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:10,693
so I know I can do it but I think they think
I'm kind of coming to terms with his I've
always been an operations hacker who happens
to have coding skills

214
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,530
it just so happens that my coding skills

215
00:47:14,388 --> 00:48:14,870
one day are better than the operation skills
and if you spend all their time on coding
than your operation skills get soft as I
have been experiencing last 3 days not
knowing how to set up NFS and having to look
up how to set up an exports file is the most
fucking embarrassing thing because I used to
know the shit I just know it like the back
of my hand is kind of thing I could just
like pull it out anytime and you can't do
everything so you have to decide how you're
going to break down yourself and so I'm
going to spend less time on so we're going
to Learn Python JavaScript we don't have a
code in Python JavaScript go and a little
bit of sea during the Olympics be in a
booster we're going to learn enough coding
to be dangerous that's the point so you can
understand or seeking where you learn how to
code in order to make utilities and
understand how software works it's super
important that you get that as an operations
person but if we're learning how to code in
order to under to seek to understand into
Annalise software for vulnerabilities and to
see how it works as a much different goal
than learning some shity day today

216
00:48:14,877 --> 00:48:55,847
now everything's in order to write really
intense crazy amazing software from the
beginning and design it beautifully that's a
valid goal and I love that stuff you but but
I am when I'm coming to terms with you or is
it the the method of teaching coating that I
want to really emphasize on is is making
quick and dirty fast utilities to get the
job done to hack the site or two to analyze
one mobility and understand software and
that means you need to be able to read
multiple languages is a polyglot and you
need to be mine really proficient in writing
code in those languages but you need to be
really proficient in writing code in
languages that allow automation which
includes Ruby actually affect me to put that
in there

217
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:11,553
we got to put Ruby in there we got it we got
to spend at least a small amount of time
writing Ruby because because Ruby's vagrant
and Ruby's you know Ruby's the Menace boy
database we can't skip Ruby we have to do it
now Frank might like that he's a big relief
in

218
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:14,857
it's probably gone now.

219
00:49:18,616 --> 00:49:26,380
Disney products and show them an interview
and that's a question for somebody else I
don't know

220
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:42,375
Ruby's get ladder shelf to it yet it is yes
it is yeah it is you can't if we if we start
picking languages and depth of language
learning based on infrastructure engineering
jobs

221
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:47,130
earring jobs it's a much different palette
of languages right

222
00:49:47,676 --> 00:49:53,276
the sea game book and review as well the
program would be like one chance decides to
feel ya

223
00:49:53,449 --> 00:50:11,611
yeah what we're going to do I don't know
what we did we we we have a lot of a lot of
things on the table for the coding way to do
whatever you do probably glad that we're
going to try to throw another language
python Ruby we probably should do Pearl to
let me come on if you give me an operations
person and you can't reap roll

224
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:18,829
you know what this is I'm having a moment
here I'm having a moment here yeah

225
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:26,545
I'm having a moment because yeah

226
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:33,759
I'm having a moment here Pearl Pizzeria I
think you need to learn all for you to be
able to read it

227
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:49,107
so if we're going to teach operations
programming then having broad knowledge of
multiple languages is way more important
than in-depth knowledge of one language it's
way more important

228
00:50:51,394 --> 00:51:08,864
and you know that means you need to be able
to read and write parole positives bash
python Ruby Go-Go and I actually I'm going
to say it you don't need rest too because
nothing's written in rusted that level

229
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:17,553
it's not you might want to make it a tool
and rust or something so I could see doing
that but I haven't even kissed you yet

230
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:23,663
girl uses basic Ruby to save space

231
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:34,214
yeah of course it is you're going to put in
your Journal I think it was a joke

232
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:41,447
I think the empty was drilling you know

233
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:48,434
I've never once I open an application in C
plus plus to understand it in order to do my
job

234
00:51:48,434 --> 00:51:53,245
I've opened a ton of shit and see and go

235
00:51:53,424 --> 00:52:03,248
knowing how to compile C code we need to
include seeing here but we don't need to
include sea to the level knowing how to
compile C code

236
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:22,141
has been a core thing for doing any kind of
Linux work at all if you wanted to Jen to
anything like that you have to know what
make is you have to know how to compile C
code you don't necessarily have to know C
code you have to know how to make C code or
C plus plus code

237
00:52:25,260 --> 00:53:21,509
actually need the copy this out and put it
in that I feel good about this now I feel a
lot better it's just this just opened up a
bunch of time for us to do kind of a deeper
think so simple and the infrastructure
engineering boost we're going to we're going
to touch on compiling see applications we're
going to touch on creating a packages and
understanding the package systems of the
world RPM yum will talk about Pac-Man just
say it exists but it's not a thing it's not
an Enterprise thing at all these make to
compile I know that I was just stupid I hate
that they do but we need to know it so all
that stuff has to go in infrastructure
engineering because infrastructure
engineering is about creating it
applications installing them testing them
and stuff like that it's more about getting
the stuff to compile then it is knowing how
the code works even though a little bit of
knowing other code words make sense likes
from scratch for sure I would love to do a
Linux from scratch the gentoos actually just
as good pretty much

238
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:27,386
but but yeah and we're kind of actually
doing a Linux from scratch with Negron

239
00:53:27,387 --> 00:54:04,773
greetings for fastest 400 is more valuable
to an operations of a structure engineer and
then you know learning to code in Ruby
because or anything like that because that's
the stuff for engineering task not to be
able to create your own lightweight Linux
distros is fucking crazy good as I think
there is some C and infrastructure
engineering you know there's like C for
operations and I mean and I don't think we
need to touch and see both of us if
something's been compiled a written to see
if I was supposed to be fine but very little
software for Linux is written in simplest
plus very little

240
00:54:04,804 --> 00:54:10,255
yeah yes

241
00:54:10,662 --> 00:54:20,247
so I feel better about this I feel better
about this can always link stuff that's fine
as long as it's not me no boobs or something

242
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,562
yeah I think this is much better yam

243
00:54:56,887 --> 00:55:15,769
make isn't I to see anyway it's just a
number 120 people think for it come on BMT
it come on

244
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:21,556
I mean it's I agree with you but it's a
little bit pet pedantic

245
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:48,581
except for they do have a sub shell for
every line

246
00:55:56,197 --> 00:55:57,401
yeah

247
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:11,751
we're not dropping see we're not dropping
see we're moving see into the infrastructure
engineering boost and we're going to learn C
and we're going to learn system calls and
we're going to estrace

248
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:17,291
because those dance and know how to make C
code right

249
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:25,539
and and I guess it's supposed to be a boost
it will say hey if you want to go over and
see you go do you know the sea the sea book
on it

250
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:30,764
mitigate containers in kubernetes

251
00:56:43,258 --> 00:56:45,875
yeah I think we'll do that same

252
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:54,880
I feel like

253
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:02,928
I feel like I want to keep him in a row I
don't want to do that

254
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,277
ebpf yeah

255
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:26,809
yeah if you have Tracy needs to be in there
so I'm saying this this stuff that we're
talking about it's more infrastructure and
security related it's it's and it's kind of
hacker it borders on hackers hackers Ness

256
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:37,811
I like that these are building up to each
other so I'm going to do that

257
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:46,929
all right

258
00:57:54,527 --> 00:58:01,318
yeah I was going to in January but I don't
think so I think we should start the new
year with containers

259
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:03,531
I think we should

260
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:16,762
hell I don't even know if we should do
getting the gig maybe we could probably do
that in like

261
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:21,138
two weeks it doesn't mean that many weeks

262
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:28,606
we can't cover curious in 6 weeks and we
can't

263
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:41,668
I'm making a Command Decision you can have
to get your own fucking job you can't we can
talk about getting a gig and getting a job
during the AMA time and help you get the job

264
00:58:41,669 --> 00:58:44,458
the love to see and I yeah

265
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:51,537
well I just think that we're talking about
just knowing how to put C and I into a
system you know that's a big thing

266
00:58:52,463 --> 00:58:56,377
make it a m a i think you're right yeah

267
00:58:58,486 --> 00:59:04,878
how many days is 3 hours bullshitI call
bullshit

268
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:41,069
this kind of is a Lennox a sorry thing

269
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,118
play just a Lennox beginner bass

270
01:00:18,457 --> 01:00:22,862
that's crazy funny why are you not VIP that
just made me laugh

271
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:35,947
oh my God that's funny that is why funny

272
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:48,242
if you make me laugh you get VIP very very
capricious

273
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:55,229
entertain me

274
01:00:59,883 --> 01:01:05,703
communities can later well

275
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:14,341
I'm dropping JavaScript

276
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:27,289
7th grade

277
01:01:30,513 --> 01:01:36,695
I think I'm going to I'm going to I think
I'm going to drop JavaScript

278
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:46,390
if you it's more important for you to learn
Ruby than JavaScript is an operations person
by far

279
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:55,305
hateful eight Chevy out yeah job in 15 hours

280
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:04,917
did you have to lie learn it in 15 hours
that's phenomenal

281
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,619
did you learn it that's fantastic

282
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:22,170
do to do to do I can cover very pretty cover

283
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:39,898
I think your idea using them for yours good
job Daniel

284
01:02:44,396 --> 01:02:50,101
I'll make a program out of you

285
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:55,625
high tide driver how are you

286
01:02:59,628 --> 01:03:09,189
I got to go anywhere that's more creative
than our mdash rfm people laughing about
that that's a nice job that's a nice joke
hey look my schedule just got a lot easier

287
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:13,408
I'm serious I'm I'm dropping I'm dropping
JavaScript

288
01:03:18,277 --> 01:03:25,885
I'm dropping you off at your look you can
you can pick up JavaScript like that if you
learn how to code in review python in Pearl

289
01:03:29,692 --> 01:03:33,936
no it's not it's not anywhere near modern
operations

290
01:03:34,574 --> 01:03:41,812
hello what the heck does above do not run at
seriously look up your computer

291
01:03:41,337 --> 01:03:46,288
your computer at one time I did actually
delete /

292
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:55,055
yes it will as long as you do it yes you
have to have to do it as rude

293
01:03:58,007 --> 01:03:59,409
so

294
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,145
this pulling up programming I still want to
do this

295
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:21,158
but it's not core it's not core to this

296
01:04:22,915 --> 01:04:28,573
we need to I don't know if we want to do
just like a generic polygon programming I
feel like we need to do

297
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,007
programming for operations

298
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:37,573
and we need to focus on that that's like
really important

299
01:04:38,448 --> 01:04:40,857
you know

300
01:04:45,504 --> 01:04:51,636
tea organizer always falls in the summer.
That's not good

301
01:04:54,229 --> 01:05:00,219
I don't know if note is a part of it I don't
think it is I've never seen no use in
operations

302
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:12,158
if anybody can give me an example of node
being used in any operational capacity let
me know but there are so many other fucking
languages to learn

303
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:16,203
that I just can't imagine it

304
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:23,274
just in case we have no business being in
operational programming class

305
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:34,809
notice heavily used in what

306
01:05:37,945 --> 01:05:44,275
they're just to deploy their apps that's not
operations at the devops

307
01:05:48,160 --> 01:06:00,349
yeah but you look running note on a server
is fine that's that's not that's not the
point architecture right so if anybody knows
of a core tool that uses JavaScript

308
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:16,740
as its method I mean here's the thing that
we're facing today right you've got to learn
Ruby you got to learn it you got to learn
that you've got to learn Pearl and Python
and as much as I don't like any of those
yeah I mean I'm not I'm not fighting with
you by the way

309
01:06:17,192 --> 01:06:21,042
omelette how much

310
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:30,748
okay I could probably figure out when and
how to eat that a p l

311
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,801
not app something like infrastructure yeah

312
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:42,962
no she's she's just making it just now is
she coming or twice at 10 to me first
attempts to sex and I'll just have to meet
with an omelet

313
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:55,531
she's like she's like flashing me off-screen
you guys missed that earlier you finished or
yoga

314
01:06:56,508 --> 01:07:16,315
I love her so much he's so much fun but my
wife is just so hilarious you just keeps me
laughing all the time electron uses no dies
but but it's not an operations we don't do
you get a very much we used to be used to go
get together and then it was very personal
thing if if you like sitting next to
somebody in

315
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:25,690
you know what you do daily or get to think
what we do yoga together as we go out for a
date whoever day two yoga School yoga class
is actually really good video of us doing
yoga together

316
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:34,800
it says I'm on vacation because I canceled
the C-Class

317
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,475
it says I'm on vacation cuz I canceled the
C-Class and

318
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:43,493
I didn't know how else to do it

319
01:07:44,101 --> 01:08:09,690
I realize I might be able to hit the
schedule the way I want to and get certified
as just too much to do so I have to drop a C
class in February 12th that's only two weeks
as soon as I can finish the book so I might
as well just quit the book now and keep
going on the community stuff and
infrastructure stuff and and and simplify
the counter which is where I'm still Adam
still I'm so fucking around the calendar but
I feel really good about this so

320
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:15,876
we need we need something we need a book
that's about programming for operations

321
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,047
in

322
01:09:39,553 --> 01:09:46,640
how about we call it scripting Yo Gotti
listen to memory map

323
01:09:56,142 --> 01:09:59,067
I kind of feel like we need power showing
their butt

324
01:10:12,536 --> 01:10:15,031
bash python Pearl and Ruby

325
01:10:19,106 --> 01:10:21,874
I mean these are the leaders right

326
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:36,413
Posh works on Lennox it does I know it's
hard as hell we saw it last year like two
years ago we were laughing all the time all
the way through it

327
01:10:38,185 --> 01:10:42,765
yeah I can be in

328
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:49,514
yeah if you guys have a few questions BMT is
the person to contact

329
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:57,654
I think I think this is this is what it
comes down to

330
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:18,958
do you put Jason and emaline there I kind of
feel like they go Ruby has to be there

331
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:34,034
you know why Ruby is still a huge part of
Chef and people have shifted what are our
work we still have Chef that place you know
that we have ten thousand or more lines the
Procol that people still have to read

332
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:38,457
basically if you want to be a Linux person

333
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:53,544
you need to be able to understand the
different interpreted languages that are
used for stripping buttocks and that's
that's all I mean I'm I'm coming to terms
with this actually having gone through this
particular the vagrant stuff because vagrant
saw it you what else is all the medicine
Boyd

334
01:11:55,129 --> 01:12:03,089
I don't know if I should jump ya know
somebody by now what the capacity

335
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:06,895
typical

336
01:12:10,521 --> 01:12:14,897
I'm talking shit about you in French

337
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:21,886
how to say hi if you at work still probably
important for working of you

338
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:31,320
I don't think a functional programming
language has any place near here not for
this not for operations in scripting

339
01:12:32,852 --> 01:12:44,301
Shopify is Ruby Ruby's everywhere Metasploit
databases is Ruby all the boot camp shirt is
in Ruby on Rails is still out there

340
01:12:48,236 --> 01:12:50,414
so you know

341
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:58,797
like Nick saucer doll yeah I want to learn
French

342
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:05,007
so you can talk shit about people hey hey
hey hey for you honey thank you for that

343
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:11,333
Kyle now no I'm a nice day

344
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:23,061
and she'll bash python Ferrari we're not
going to see show cuz it's fucking dangerous

345
01:13:25,988 --> 01:13:27,091
Ruby

346
01:13:27,596 --> 01:13:42,209
I like I like I like how this is going and
if we keep it Linux flavored then we will
then we can get away with not putting
flowers on there cuz I mean who gives a shit
about power so I figured it if you're going
to be a hacker you have to learn I don't
want to force you any battery works

347
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:47,812
oh you should have some pretty freaky

348
01:13:48,904 --> 01:13:56,861
I get a Texas and Haskell is it will fuck
maybe we need to learn Haskell on F

349
01:13:57,137 --> 01:14:07,810
I mean I put scripting in here for a reason
I put scripting for a reason because
scripting is not the same

350
01:14:08,056 --> 01:14:18,859
you cannot pandoxx Haskell I know I love it
and I still have my back is my single
favorite Haskell application so the only
application

351
01:14:19,078 --> 01:14:25,440
hey Daniel thank you for that nursing
service dog I'll know

352
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:29,988
internationally have Saturday pop top

353
01:14:31,091 --> 01:15:04,372
all right so we have been expecting a shell
and Paul got put on I think probably got
programming is probably a good separate book
this book is going to be like okay here's
how to do this book we can do a polyglot
shell scripting in scripting and I make a
new poly got programming and it can like get
into the deeper things like functional
programming so like that you know what does
it mean to compile code python python is is
there because it's a good compliment to a
judgeship if it would be great if we could
do see in here

354
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:10,772
do you know Sego Python and JavaScript

355
01:15:15,246 --> 01:15:17,649
I think we should do see

356
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:25,047
I don't want to put in there because you
can't understand your computer until you
learn to see

357
01:15:25,048 --> 01:15:27,458
I know but

358
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:47,587
this is this this particular class doesn't
doesn't fit anywhere in here anymore this is
a probe from Canarsie I went through the
book again review that I used to hate it I
don't think a lot of its relevant I like him
first he first as the book that we were
supposed to do right now but we're done with
it you can't understand assembly before you
going to see

359
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:51,489
yeah I think you need to learn C

360
01:15:53,155 --> 01:15:55,960
and eventually

361
01:15:57,328 --> 01:16:01,388
have I really want to go and see you go B on
a graduation

362
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:21,323
we need to learn go in order to understand
how software is written in the
infrastructure space

363
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:23,002
and

364
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:29,681
for activities the container Securities
boost is this the end of time

365
01:16:30,448 --> 01:16:35,635
the links and Cody is going to be doing
we're going to show shell coding

366
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:48,639
yeah I don't know hey how are you doing
thank you

367
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:55,969
how's it going to be X you need to have a
boy

368
01:16:55,969 --> 01:17:02,305
yeah I've been said that I've had a lot of
fun it's been really fun actually

369
01:17:02,305 --> 01:17:10,452
life is been fun I go back and forth has
been really depressed other days I'm on top
of the world I feel I feel positive today
but

370
01:17:10,453 --> 01:17:12,752
just up your I see ya

371
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:20,804
okay so I guess I was wondering before I
jump into the NFL smell time in Vegas

372
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:26,079
can I woke up and I was looking at the stuff
and

373
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:33,711
realization hit me that the stuff that's not
covered

374
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:42,156
is the infrastructure stuff this is the
stuff that's lacking from the internet like
good content written about infrastructure
and Lennox and operations is

375
01:17:41,600 --> 01:18:03,394
is substantial Tikka t1x is substantially
missing from the internet just not there
I've searched high and low and I don't want
to throw anybody to the bus but the contents
out there is very very minimal and the the
container security stuff that's out there
and light it's done from a Mac and that's
fine but

376
01:18:03,538 --> 01:18:21,532
you know containers for Alex technology. Yes
I know other technologies have it but
they're not the basis of the entire Cloud
made of Revolution Alexi is and that's when
it's only so teaching containers and
communities on a Max just makes me my skin
crawl

377
01:18:21,623 --> 01:18:29,831
because it's not attacking anybody lie just
so

378
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:38,787
anyway this is this is this feels good this
feels good this feels good that's what she
said

379
01:18:57,822 --> 01:19:01,199
the backing of some big Iron unisystems
everybody yeah

380
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:06,048
well it's getting more that just hear about
their their talk and could raise on the
Mainframe now

381
01:19:06,585 --> 01:19:15,269
yeah it's been a lots of fun. Tell me what
have you heard about that in any official
capacity there's a lots of writing right now
on it

382
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:31,622
yeah there's there's lots of writing about
communities on on Big Iron again which is
going to be full circle as soon as
everybody's running kubernetes on on
Mainframe it'll just be so perfectly
poetically ironic

383
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:40,319
it's going to happen and all that big
processing power Office Max in Python

384
01:19:41,413 --> 01:19:46,968
is there until I come out yeah yes

385
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:52,748
so anything about learning tripping like
that is that that's going to make it so
basically

386
01:19:53,065 --> 01:20:04,638
this cycle this yearly cycle will make you
one fucking Kick-Ass hacker without actually
ever saying we're teaching you to be a
hacker

387
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:25,995
because you'll be understanding all the
stuff that you can use once you understand
how to deploy your own communities close to
her home you can like lunch that shitt at
the internet and do all kind of pen testing
scans which is something I want to do it
said something I haven't done yet but I'm
definitely on the way to doing it and see
what API vs. back by my friend yeah

388
01:20:25,997 --> 01:20:31,895
that's what I'm saying and keep baby I can
be anything right it's coming you know
what's going

389
01:20:31,896 --> 01:20:45,667
you know it's coming watch I being like
enter the game with some like massive single
solution and all that Enterprise cloud and
just like destroy red hat oh wait they are
red hat

390
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:50,498
they're you know if they put open shift on
Mainframe

391
01:20:50,499 --> 01:20:58,001
yeah this was I just read about this that's
why it's that's why it's in my that's why
it's in my interests lately

392
01:20:58,002 --> 01:21:01,140
I just read about this came across my feed
the other day

393
01:21:02,152 --> 01:21:11,474
becoming a car that think about hockey yeah
I made a hacker's just British people
understand shit right I know how to break
down problems

394
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:13,060
yeah

395
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:20,629
Lenox I might be a cat is to tell me about
this all the time until Park clusters

396
01:21:20,631 --> 01:21:30,045
working on registry holyshit a master's in
coasters in the hoods houses anymore is that
a date Nicole control planes

397
01:21:30,046 --> 01:21:34,779
you racist pigs i b m

398
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:41,643
seriously don't call it Master anymore did
you see they're getting rid of the the thing

399
01:21:43,907 --> 01:21:47,023
I don't have a custom running right now

400
01:21:47,024 --> 01:21:52,186
I like I do I don't I don't have a class or
a nevermind

401
01:21:52,320 --> 01:22:02,997
but yeah it's called you can call the
control thing they're calling it control
plane, Master as the rolls but they're
dropping Master is one of the roles in in
1.24

402
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:10,946
is asking for a friend these windows yeah
yeah I think it was over

403
01:22:10,946 --> 01:22:16,113
there in 2008 throughout Microsoft Office
and they use open office now

404
01:22:16,113 --> 01:22:23,960
so that's kind of cool with you cuz cuz I
want to cuz cuz I want to eat with you

405
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,519
oh my God you should smell this

406
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:35,404
on a cold Sunday morning is smell of an
omelette with cheese

407
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:49,503
oh my God you guys yall chat I'm going to
coerce the dog is right here in 2 seconds I
know you thought you were going to see me
stream but instead I'm going to eat the
omelette

408
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:56,636
it won't take that long am I dropping until
I thought it was still hot

409
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,535
so operate

410
01:23:01,694 --> 01:23:08,940
how about this back at back at 3:30

411
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,249
I buy

412
01:37:44,536 --> 01:37:48,545
alright I'm back I was good

413
01:37:50,046 --> 01:37:57,381
but anyways was able to go stream about
touching you at nice ancient good job we
have to go watch you

414
01:37:59,402 --> 01:38:06,688
question you should do see coding cuz I'm
not going to need to stream PC coating not
me

415
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:15,018
how about that how about we do then did you
do did you do the deal stream

416
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:18,021
encoding nice

417
01:38:19,114 --> 01:38:24,754
that's great I mean this in a thing to add
anything to that I've been realizing is that
I don't have to do everything

418
01:38:25,253 --> 01:38:53,526
add still stuck I did have to do everything
I did I had to give people backgrounds and
everything right but I don't have to do
anymore I can point people to data
structures and algorithms like in point
people to do you know C plus plus in Striker
or you know assembly with him also or he
doesn't scream that much anymore but you
know I'm saying and he put people at the
other stuff I'll Lesley streaming again
she's getting kind of crazy

419
01:39:02,071 --> 01:39:07,860
all right so let's do other stuff

420
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:25,179
alright so so so so let's get back into some
of this other stuff since I'm now here

421
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:33,265
tell me what if you're still there too I
don't tomorrow or something we need to talk
about doing The Keg stuff

422
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:40,255
and I mean we need to get people like ready
for that kind of stuff

423
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:46,230
so let's do that

424
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:54,136
all right back to the NFS that so I'm going
to get going fast here before I get going I
just want to make sure everybody

425
01:39:52,747 --> 01:39:55,377
can hear put a marker

426
01:39:56,329 --> 01:40:01,894
where's my marker starting and Fs

427
01:40:03,805 --> 01:40:05,996
I wish you could see the markers

428
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:12,000
let me set some goals for the day so today

429
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:46,461
today the goal is to finish setting up the
NFS client automated setup of NFS through
scripting on from the control the workers
and just have that SharePoint ready so that
we can run this big of a file and after
you're done with it you get three machines
low power machines that have and if it's
working and then you can understand how did
you send it so this lab is something that I
do hope to

430
01:40:47,330 --> 01:41:24,044
expanded to something other people can do if
they want to learn it fast does it need
bigger in the name probably not in fact I
think I'm probably going to rename a bunch
of these things as just like Lavender Fest
you know and get rid of vagrant in there and
just assume that vagrant is going to be to
go to tool for provisioning virtual machines
you know I got back and forth on whether
vagrant I like it or not and use of Ruby or
not and and there's a couple of lessons
learned that I that I've made so so one of
them is learn Ruby

431
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:31,486
Ruby is still a core language for

432
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:37,391
operations type types of things

433
01:41:38,499 --> 01:41:46,483
it is used in vagrant Chef Metasploit

434
01:41:47,504 --> 01:41:50,609
and many and

435
01:41:50,609 --> 01:41:55,834
and in many other scripted environments

436
01:41:56,873 --> 01:42:03,895
it is mandatory how's it going it is

437
01:42:07,013 --> 01:42:09,638
recurring Lee obvious

438
01:42:13,386 --> 01:42:19,551
it is obvious to me that it must be included

439
01:42:19,551 --> 01:42:25,256
in the list of essential scripting languages

440
01:42:26,484 --> 01:42:29,674
for any would-be infrastructure in Virginia

441
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:44,014
so the very first cell phone we did add to
work are you silly

442
01:42:45,063 --> 01:42:52,891
I love her for surform yeah I don't know if
I would ever go for that there's a couple
reasons for that

443
01:42:53,081 --> 01:43:21,475
yeah that's the main reason that I have
soured on the Isle of a I love it is that
it's just not mainstream enough it's not
mainstream enough for the stuff that
operations people need to do you still need
to learn delivered because lot of the
Technologies and operations going to use it
going to be using zendan KVM and all that
stuff so you need to know it as a part of a
structure anybody should you make it your
primary driver for vagrant and terraformed
and everything else probably.

444
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:38,402
I absolutely would rather this is I'm going
to say something that's that's pretty
controversial I would rather learn Ruby and
keep it fresh and on the tip of my skill-set
than HCL

445
01:43:38,934 --> 01:43:50,855
I'm not a fan of haschak work or a language
and it to the point where I would probably
actually not use it I would probably end up
using something that's not HCL

446
01:43:52,442 --> 01:43:54,723
just cuz

447
01:43:54,737 --> 01:44:34,334
I'm just not not a fan of it I doesn't mean
that you can't get away with it pelumi and
other things like that so there's like that
an entire group of languages you have to
learn for operations that are structured
data languages like and configuration
language is like a sauna in Yamhill and HCL
and Tamil and an XML and and properties
about those are all things that also have to
be learned as an operator so again I keep
coming back to what does an infrastructure
operations engineer who has Kick-Ass coding
skills learned as opposed to what does a
software engineer need to learn write and
and as a hacker and infrastructure engineer
you need to learn

448
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:43,909
you need to learn all of the configuration
languages on planet Earth languages are
starting to take off and infrastructure

449
01:44:44,608 --> 01:45:04,583
h e HCL is is pretty is pretty, I only know
it's used in one place and hatch Carlos use
it for that okay or no your not ugly as Sin
though I didn't like it at all okay for sure
though Rico you know it's learning Rico and
it is so you know you can learn JavaScript
or you can learn Rigo

450
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:15,164
you know if you're a kubernetes person
you're going to learn Rigo's give you much
more valuable to you than JavaScript the
same nobody here has even heard of it but
it's way more more valuable

451
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:24,645
so so that's that's going to come from so
let's do this stuff is all running

452
01:45:25,188 --> 01:45:27,785
I think we have already got stuff running

453
01:45:29,562 --> 01:45:34,917
alright so here we have the recap what we
did

454
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:40,420
it's not like riding 10 miles of Ruby's
going to teach teach taught me we or anybody
movie

455
01:45:42,728 --> 01:45:54,620
yeah I know I saw it and look up once upon a
time I knew Ruby Ruby much better than I did
now I don't know how much today but you need
to learn it in order to read it and write it

456
01:45:54,899 --> 01:46:00,657
and therefore much more approachable than
the following me but wait for the ABS thing

457
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:41,332
yeah well I mean that's again as an
operations person your job is learning
configuration language is very quickly and
scripting it's it's a part of the job so you
know and then writing code that writes other
scripting code you mean that's a part of the
job it really is so and if you don't any web
stuff is because you wanted to make some
stupid graphic interface because your
manager needed it instead of a command line
tool I'll have some of you have forgotten
almost all that yeah I can write something
today I was that way with roll last year I
was at my throat Cipro for 15 years and
could not remember any of it so I still feel
like it's it's worth you know relearning it

458
01:46:41,335 --> 01:47:03,338
very productive yeah me too you know I
really slammed on bigger for being so old
and using Ruby and stuff and then I looked
at you know Chef which is also old and
Amanda split so with your chances are it is
never charges are you going to run across
Ruby in some form and Baker is has been a
reminder of that for me so so let's just go
through this

459
01:47:03,797 --> 01:47:30,282
this is so he's been keeping up with what
I'm doing here big breakthroughs BP here is
definitely been lb gdn who is been very
patiently helping me through this and
suggesting kindly you should probably read
all the documents on Baker and I'm like okay
fine and I actually am about ready to commit
to it really learning vagrant because I find
it very useful

460
01:47:30,284 --> 01:47:46,033
and I I don't know I I keep thinking if I'm
going to do I can do the same thing with
ansible terraform using I've heard that you
can use terraform using the you know that
you can use their form and then use the the
local provider

461
01:47:46,640 --> 01:48:00,012
they looked at the 1st of October Banner
provider but you know it doesn't it's
delivered provider didn't work very well
when I did it out of the box but you can
definitely do it

462
01:48:00,014 --> 01:48:20,656
what's that if any Paceman call in 5 minutes
yes now I can't I use the enterprise-level
accessory infrastructure know it's
absolutely not it's not it actually should
be you know who uses it the people who need
to provision architecture quickly and test
it on a local system

463
01:48:20,657 --> 01:48:28,541
that's who's using Meghan right now
development shops and architecture shops
that need to deploy

464
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:34,896
you know Nann simple architectures in order
to do their development and testing

465
01:48:34,897 --> 01:48:57,052
where containers won't cover that container
is coming at 9:10 so that I might get
container will cover that but when it
doesn't cover it like in my case where I
need to provision an extra disc and test
feeling that this so I can create a
community notification that the disease
getting full and type that to my single
which is my immediate demand that's not
something that can be done

466
01:48:57,055 --> 01:49:08,037
you know we've toyed with terraform and
ansible being able to do the same thing so
anyway vagrant is kind of the go to tool for
this for this kind of thing

467
01:49:08,207 --> 01:49:13,573
cell that's that's where we're coming from

468
01:49:20,442 --> 01:49:56,567
back in a day or so I'll dance we're running
kisses to set up her back as good news I
heard it's it's it's old it's like really
really all of the fact that reason I threw
it out the window and it's writing shit
about it as I asked if I could have figured
out needed Baba bhajans right bastard and I
don't know if I think any of that anymore I
because I got it to work and one of the ways
I got it to work was was not swimming
upstream and using the original box driver
instead of Liberty which is a lot slower but
it's got a pretty broad support across and
there's a great recipes for all kinds of
stuff

469
01:49:56,775 --> 01:50:15,660
Universal boxes are pretty standard thing to
do anyway so this is what I did actually
this came from my BG babe put the the school
thing that gives you a static IP we
discovered yesterday after a lot of waste of
time that if you don't do that and you don't
add this

470
01:50:15,721 --> 01:50:22,883
that you're you'll end up with

471
01:50:23,129 --> 01:50:28,248
and if you don't do that you'll end up with
systems that have the same ethernet

472
01:50:29,352 --> 01:51:12,589
have the same address you're like what the
fuc nothing is a long time to figure out but
that's a problem with the image of probably
not like when we don't know but this is the
way to do it and it's actually gives you a
consistent IP number so that I can then do
that I can script the the the Manifest
creation so it was me why are you doing Anna
Faris in vagra doesn't make any fucking
sense and the reason I'm doing it in vagrant
is because I want to simulate creating an
NFS Mount and doing that work a real keep
doing that work in any other ways rather
dangerous in my opinion and how are you
going to test creating an NFS

473
01:51:12,593 --> 01:51:14,211
hey going to do it

474
01:51:14,444 --> 01:51:34,590
you know you going to provision the volume
you got to put a different thing you can do
but you know testing on your Hardware I mean
that's how we used to it so they can is a
good way for testing this setup and
practicing and I think just registration
Baker in his is got a lot of a lot of tools
was that by default that VM only has a net
only network interface

475
01:51:34,594 --> 01:51:41,661
yeah the root cause was that by default the
VM only has not only network interface

476
01:51:41,664 --> 01:51:46,156
and that was the net inside of a gnat and
that's why they all have the same IP

477
01:51:46,170 --> 01:52:02,932
which is weird I mean you think they would
still I don't know why I feel like they
should have at least change the Mac
addresses even if they were all mad and you
know him by that but since they were like
mine. I guess I figured we didn't need to
just give Mom a sandwich it was very weird
to me I did not

478
01:52:09,392 --> 01:52:12,297
can't wait to hit the net yam

479
01:52:12,387 --> 01:52:35,657
yeah you do we did but he and I don't need
to hit the network on this is just bigger
right the whole point of doing this is I I
want stuff to be contained I don't the whole
reason for using a VM for this kind of stuff
instead of Darker it because I want the
volumes of stuff to be contained and safe to
use

480
01:52:35,659 --> 01:52:40,489
I do. I do want it interesting that it
didn't create a drive here

481
01:52:41,945 --> 01:52:50,608
did you notice that did you know that LPG
when I gave it a name last time when I give
it a file it actually made the the file

482
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:59,761
here and I think I think the new driver the
one that we experimental driver I think it
actually stores the drive someplace else

483
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:12,546
impregnate your face yes you need to add a
new network private network interface yes
and that's that's what I was missing and I
mean I'm learning begging as we go the hard
way so

484
01:53:12,547 --> 01:53:14,859
so that's what we did we added that

485
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:27,689
so we needed to add

486
01:53:29,921 --> 01:53:33,450
all right let's do

487
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:37,943
or are you provision so let's do it by hand

488
01:53:37,944 --> 01:53:42,471
and came back so you ain't had an ex
examples added

489
01:53:43,211 --> 01:53:50,180
I know I like X example that at one point
actually at one point I had that

490
01:53:50,181 --> 01:53:54,335
yeah if you want to addicts example is fine
I I put

491
01:53:53,050 --> 01:53:59,650
I put all that under description but I like
I would like to be able to pull the example
separate from the description

492
01:54:00,099 --> 01:54:04,138
yeah if you want to put a folder question on
that let me know

493
01:54:06,417 --> 01:54:12,981
yeah I mean there's I found another library
that does non Cobra kind of stuff to you if
you're interested

494
01:54:13,071 --> 01:54:20,379
escoger Coco dancer from topic let's do this
so we're going to do

495
01:54:21,983 --> 01:54:28,477
I'm going to split this up and I'm going to
do the steps by hand and then I'm going to
try to automate them

496
01:54:28,919 --> 01:54:47,224
and there's something in my hand is because
I'm trying to solidify my knowledge of i n f
s o what is NFS I don't want to get into it
talked about yesterday NFS is the network
files stored protocol a file system from
file server whatever you call it what is it
actually stand for

497
01:54:47,875 --> 01:54:53,396
Network file system never file server

498
01:54:54,148 --> 01:55:26,268
what's the official title number file system
overview forever it's a protocol that allows
storage over the over the over the network
and it's slow compared to other modern ones
like South Bend stuff like that but still
it's still primarily used for giving any
such as important to know how to do it and
the process of creating a drive on Linux is
another thing this is kind of Linux
infrastructure and write how many how many
raise your hand if you actually Provisions
your own

499
01:55:26,272 --> 01:55:27,598
disc

500
01:55:28,560 --> 01:56:23,077
has anybody ever plugged in their own disc
into the computer or otherwise and set it up
to be a volume on the system to be usable to
be a file here to be able to see CDN to it
and write stuff into it in files or
something. That is like a fundamental task
of Unix system administration and if you're
doing it after using if you're using aren't
you had to do it that way right yeah if
you're so Arch people know how to do this
right because they do it all the time this
is it is very educational so if you want to
go through the old school way of setting up
a Lennox machine like I used to do back in
the 90s we setting up our church requires
you to do all that stuff I hand it isn't
just magically work when you turn it on a FS
are in a mess I don't care about the
comparison between the two I am again I'm a
very practical person and NFS is the thing
to use

501
01:56:23,088 --> 01:56:45,255
now it's either NFL starts with a newer
version right NFS in our case is the the
abstraction to an NES solution is also the
abstraction to gpfs which is another IBM
solution c o n f s tends to be the middle
ground because it's so common even though
it's got problems so you have to do and what
I need to do so I need to go on the system

502
01:56:45,258 --> 01:56:47,419
are you going to control

503
01:56:47,763 --> 01:57:08,707
and it's give me the warning cuz they do
things burn one of my own and even Ellis be
okay let me show you your block devices so
he can see we have sta this is this is SDF
it's as if he has got your ID for sure right
so I used to be

504
01:57:08,893 --> 01:57:56,742
God damn I mean back in the day it was IDE
version either this is a protocol for a disc
attached to the device you know what's crazy
is the standard so sketchy or say that if
you have if you have you know ssds and you
have nvme India me is is his big long ass
thing so it doesn't have a melting point and
there's nothing really there are you going
to sell the swap doesn't have a non-point
right because it's just a vault it's just
it's just a block of ones and zeros in 0 on
a distant place at s file that that is used
by the system however it wants to know what
is melted that means it's got a file system
on top of it it's a week this is the steps
we need to create the partition which we did
already through vagrant we need to mount the
point oh boy

505
01:57:56,748 --> 01:58:01,084
what is this optional vagrant setup for
Microsoft

506
01:58:01,278 --> 01:58:09,263
he's begging for being provisioning however
it is not necessary I want to Biggers
installed

507
01:58:09,263 --> 01:58:14,668
megabox add Fedora why would they say
they're using liver to

508
01:58:15,932 --> 01:58:18,642
else we got

509
01:58:21,703 --> 01:58:25,550
am I right hat Microsoft

510
01:58:26,694 --> 01:58:34,066
they provide baking soda for the really
interesting EVS CO2 vagrant

511
01:58:34,856 --> 01:58:36,871
organization file

512
01:58:37,062 --> 01:59:20,183
well that's actually good as I think of that
that's another you know a good indication
that they going to still use out there it's
not that it might not be commonly is I first
heard about it from a really Kick-Ass
Security administrator on YouTube can't
remember who it was they did not have any
likes or subs or anything but they were
really neither shit and they use vagrant to
simulate kubernetes up and down all the time
they bring up Complex Community environments
like at the drop of a hat using vagran that
we're not many Cube they had they consider
their own storage classes and everything and
so I think this is a real key to Lynn
operators kind of you know to the toolbox so
let's go for it so the next steps are too

513
01:59:20,627 --> 02:00:14,565
the next the next steps are to go into sdb
and to make it into a thing right now is
just a blob of ones and zeros in a volume
that doesn't really matter doesn't have any
music system doesn't know about it there's
no way to contact the seller anything and so
we're going to do we going to see who asks
you to ask me to do a lot of stuff is rout
an extra going to do going to make when you
run a program called fdisk and you have to
point this out the volume that you want to
do SUV or at the are going to partition so
if this goes for partitioning I destroyed so
are the volume and you can see all the
things you can do here we did this yesterday
but I'm going to the fastest time you can
see how much free space do you have it
really doesn't have to be that complicated

514
02:00:15,088 --> 02:00:18,398
so if we do

515
02:00:18,706 --> 02:00:30,313
every free you season all that all that case
we have nine make free right so we're going
to add a new one in his new I think we want
a new primary partition over the whole this
without partitioning

516
02:00:31,094 --> 02:00:34,266
yeah why would you do that though

517
02:00:39,174 --> 02:00:45,224
I've never used it that way though I've
always had a partition like a primary
partition on the disk

518
02:00:48,458 --> 02:00:54,804
I've never I've never seen that in Practical
usage I've always seen this get partitioned

519
02:00:56,044 --> 02:01:02,568
it's a bunch of ice yeah but then all your
references would be the STD right

520
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:11,008
I mean I see you say let's try it let's try
it again what other reason would you use a
VM for this

521
02:01:11,419 --> 02:01:41,607
images of the hardware I would not want to
fuck around with it right because this is
just a VM I can try all kinds of shit this
is why we're doing this so let's be
dangerous right let's go ahead and run has
been making Fest directly to create a file
format the hard drive make a file system for
ext4 which is the main one and we haven't
been created yet / bass / it's been

522
02:01:41,610 --> 02:01:44,303
make a fast study xt4

523
02:01:45,187 --> 02:01:52,947
NSL / sstb please no

524
02:01:53,618 --> 02:02:00,618
your idea NFL status of the device path I
don't like you guys whenever I can avoid
them

525
02:02:01,256 --> 02:02:06,152
I try to yeah

526
02:02:06,698 --> 02:02:12,803
I know this is going to be really
interesting cuz I've never yeah

527
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:16,738
I mean it may turn it into a disc

528
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:21,488
before it was just a part so

529
02:02:23,351 --> 02:02:26,171
I don't know one buggy battle

530
02:02:27,963 --> 02:02:31,593
it actually is a couple of Elmo

531
02:02:36,491 --> 02:02:42,151
it's nice that the order that just changes
for example yeah

532
02:02:44,186 --> 02:02:51,162
yeah the partition so what's up I'm just
going to

533
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:53,747
mounts

534
02:02:53,747 --> 02:03:00,397
sdv this is so weird and have a number I am
not used to that

535
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:07,768
not used to that at all yeah it works shit

536
02:03:07,768 --> 02:03:14,353
shit so we don't need to see the partition
ha I mean for the sake of this

537
02:03:12,854 --> 02:03:17,141
I mean for the sake of this I don't we kind
of don't need it

538
02:03:18,146 --> 02:03:22,726
as I said before you can use you can use
Baker in to allocate new discs right

539
02:03:24,062 --> 02:03:32,959
there's no Perdition I don't know it's dry
it's a good thing we're just doing this
Susie something that's not I mean real

540
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:40,801
sgv if you want my prediction is this guess

541
02:03:41,183 --> 02:03:47,751
but I can see that oxt for Saints Row IV
removed. I command

542
02:03:49,883 --> 02:03:55,272
Prince stb is it sulfa volume

543
02:03:58,273 --> 02:04:05,048
I just Mabel. I'm just going in for huh
there's no free on there

544
02:04:05,224 --> 02:04:10,581
wait what there's nothing free on there

545
02:04:11,528 --> 02:04:19,494
oh that's confusing has super confusing cuz
it says it's there's got free space on there
but it doesn't

546
02:04:19,527 --> 02:04:26,116
because there's no positions written to him
is his trainer is a partition table and I
can't see it

547
02:04:26,774 --> 02:04:31,403
if it's sinful as a digital yeah

548
02:04:31,930 --> 02:04:38,422
yeah that that's super cool II that feels so
wrong to me

549
02:04:38,878 --> 02:04:57,592
I mean I understand I grew up in a time when
you always partition your disc always is
like not an option and everybody you know I
made it home at 7 partition excetera and
then they would export their home directory
animal to survive but

550
02:04:58,883 --> 02:05:06,800
I'm going to put that in my set are you
Sylvia M yeah

551
02:05:16,623 --> 02:05:19,428
you don't have to Partition

552
02:05:25,614 --> 02:05:28,933
U part it has become standard for punishing
now

553
02:05:29,027 --> 02:05:48,164
g p t I think it's more Saturday if this guy
just know I have to ask why would you use
vagrant to make volumes like this so you can
fuck around this stuff and then reverted you
can't do that in a container and you can't
do that with physical stuff easily so

554
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:55,216
I'd be obvious but you can

555
02:05:55,366 --> 02:05:58,948
used was it at sea

556
02:06:01,572 --> 02:06:04,961
the dog is yelling at my wife is so funny

557
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:46,561
again this is another thing and I think came
out of the virtualization craze in the
virtualization craze allocating disk space
is just a matter of chopping up you know
some file size someplace so the partitioning
becomes less of an issue because you can
actually Define volumes to be smaller and
use that instead of petitioning and it
simplifies you're used to volumes

558
02:07:59,846 --> 02:08:06,325
I got to put a note about that let's try as
you farted next to shower let's try gparted

559
02:08:06,816 --> 02:08:12,741
so no

560
02:08:16,259 --> 02:08:23,534
I guess I have to write the whole just a I
guess I could I can probably just still use
it even though it's already there and just
blow out the other partition table to sir

561
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:32,374
oh wait it's not on there by default do you
know where it was it what it is

562
02:08:37,672 --> 02:08:45,099
yeah I departed a graphic gparted is he part
of the graphic one there is a version that's
not graphic

563
02:08:46,648 --> 02:08:54,466
I mean parted gparted is the graphic one
right yeah I don't want to grab it then cuz
I don't have graphics

564
02:08:55,335 --> 02:08:58,089
is it going to eat right is farted

565
02:09:01,137 --> 02:09:08,077
parted oh no we don't want the recipe a bad
bad parted

566
02:09:08,899 --> 02:09:15,116
again if I if I put away I wouldn't lose
anything right yeah we don't want to no one

567
02:09:17,186 --> 02:09:20,926
yeah sub welcome

568
02:09:21,184 --> 02:09:27,088
pardon help was the commands holy shit I
don't know this cuz I've never used it

569
02:09:30,283 --> 02:09:36,476
did you print a list of your commands hey
how's it going

570
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:43,057
we talked about lab changes recently and
about formatting at some point

571
02:09:46,190 --> 02:10:13,858
yeah that made me think I might talk about
his I moved all of the references from my
labs out so that the lab is just a statement
of work like this is if something needs to
be done and I started putting everything
into a work directory that's my solution for
that particular thing parted yeah I'm I'm
not so far I'm not a fan of it make label
and make part name number for Prince quiet
select device like

572
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:21,754
Atlee best disc fdisk is kind of all over
the place just total

573
02:10:23,375 --> 02:10:27,487
yeah I don't know I don't know if I would
use I would probably accept disc

574
02:10:28,961 --> 02:10:35,764
is it a great yeah I'm a fan of ignorant
again any bigger look I'm also going to
teach Ruby

575
02:10:35,764 --> 02:10:43,770
so yeah I'm a bunch of realization just hit
me that are pretty strong

576
02:10:46,764 --> 02:10:54,727
yeah it's and how is he going to make a
machine out of mine you do a terraform

577
02:10:55,837 --> 02:11:01,905
I got to do with ansible as much as I hate
it

578
02:11:01,905 --> 02:11:09,542
Packers doesn't make her some machine Packer
is like I finished machine right

579
02:11:10,621 --> 02:11:13,211
if so

580
02:11:13,211 --> 02:11:25,618
yeah I'm I'm the biggest pain point was live
birds and and I I love the bird it's very
fast and all but I bet I'm going back to
Virtual devices original box original box
and everything has worked

581
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:27,973
everything just totally works

582
02:12:06,877 --> 02:12:11,930
oh God I think I can use logic

583
02:12:13,066 --> 02:12:17,865
I'm going to stick with fdisk on this we all
set to go to automated

584
02:12:19,077 --> 02:12:26,907
so how do we do that actually know this can
be automated on myself we don't even need
the other stuff

585
02:12:27,377 --> 02:12:34,286
yeah in one week a boy engineering design

586
02:12:33,087 --> 02:12:48,737
engineering design designing Helm charts to
fix the claimants allege No Cap no idea I
haven't taken it I haven't take a big
Blaster this people here at people in the
community can probably tell you in the crazy
thing is is it nobody here actually has
their search a clean people that are on the
cloud 8 of bored

587
02:12:48,982 --> 02:12:56,940
and so they have art and tell me what's on
the test I'm not a fan of him but I
understand

588
02:12:58,354 --> 02:13:02,045
do you understand that Helm charts are
actually

589
02:13:03,505 --> 02:13:16,720
you know what's cool about this is that we
can just run this and we don't have to do
you know what I'm glad you did that because
how would you how would you describe to
scrap the next strip the creation of it can
you connect to speed run from command line
I've never done it

590
02:13:17,348 --> 02:13:23,200
right now I'm making an FS mount for a
vagrant setup virtual machines

591
02:13:24,522 --> 02:13:26,713
yeah

592
02:13:43,336 --> 02:13:49,143
all right I don't know what to do here I'm
trying to decide

593
02:13:49,946 --> 02:13:55,767
I don't like parted oh parted he could run
to the command line

594
02:13:57,403 --> 02:14:01,858
well it's clearly included so that would
probably be the way to scripted right

595
02:14:03,321 --> 02:14:06,392
I'm going to look this up because it for the
sake of learning

596
02:14:06,652 --> 02:14:11,833
if I wanted to partition how did your new
command line create

597
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:18,450
create a partition I'm not command line

598
02:14:19,915 --> 02:14:27,742
and a greater delete partitions using
command prompt imparted

599
02:14:28,175 --> 02:14:34,213
cmdr command prompt this part this is
Windows this is Windows

600
02:14:34,913 --> 02:14:40,725
now that's when those who don't want that
prison hard riding my life prompt

601
02:14:41,271 --> 02:14:46,001
you seem to think I just have to put Linux
on there I guess so

602
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:53,847
attic reproductions a Linux any part of disc

603
02:14:55,696 --> 02:14:59,862
if I'm going to add this document

604
02:15:07,023 --> 02:15:11,773
why because I want to add to my notes

605
02:15:16,956 --> 02:15:19,250
just give me a chart

606
02:15:28,316 --> 02:15:34,886
I like that you're great I didn't hate it
when I first started using it but boy if I
come to hate it

607
02:15:35,177 --> 02:16:00,982
I just have to know what though is only
added to the 2022 so please come back and
report on what's on their own without giving
away something to get you in trouble because
I have to take it and I'm getting ready to
do ramp up my learning on how to do it when
it was on the test everything is a
preparation for area so we're going to be
going to be doing it every Saturday we're
going to be doing three days after patient's
development stuff

608
02:16:02,051 --> 02:16:05,174
so yeah that's definitely coming

609
02:16:19,402 --> 02:16:26,242
alright so he's freezing every display the
harder I like she's with struct

610
02:16:28,179 --> 02:16:36,062
she can party at Shell Savers near me

611
02:16:36,545 --> 02:16:38,687
yeah

612
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:48,011
okay so you're at your impression she can't
order that is it is more beginner-friendly c
k that's that's what I've heard that twice
now

613
02:16:48,012 --> 02:16:54,651
so I don't know but that's it's something

614
02:16:54,652 --> 02:17:00,503
want to do a suggestion predictions

615
02:17:00,503 --> 02:17:08,123
all this stuff has me doing it like not
interactively mounted

616
02:17:08,123 --> 02:17:14,809
yeah you could you make it past dashti
that's another better better command like
your stream ID like your stream ID

617
02:17:18,261 --> 02:17:25,134
I said I could work did you type a message
or did you ever sit in your video

618
02:17:26,579 --> 02:17:42,435
if your video you have to delete the whole
thing what you can do as you can when the
video editor Angeles rates go into the video
editor and create a highlight and then
highlight the entire video except for that
part and then save that is a highlight and
delete the bod

619
02:17:43,606 --> 02:17:50,340
that way you can clip it out you can shop it
out represent

620
02:17:52,761 --> 02:17:58,001
yeah I've had to do that too usually these
days I'll just delete the bod

621
02:18:15,979 --> 02:18:17,709
alright so

622
02:18:21,567 --> 02:18:26,455
I don't want to do that primary wanted it
back over here

623
02:18:27,229 --> 02:18:29,989
I'm kind of distracted Lucy here so

624
02:18:31,019 --> 02:18:37,600
best have to file is he can pass a script
file to have disk via. She'll really

625
02:18:40,383 --> 02:18:43,557
I haven't done this stuff I just lose the
always Interactive

626
02:18:51,061 --> 02:18:57,605
admission to the Saint Francis Hospital or
is that that I

627
02:19:00,628 --> 02:19:07,308
and I'm guessing it's a tie do you see cell
receptors wife

628
02:19:08,057 --> 02:19:10,785
high pressure versus Isis Lee blah

629
02:19:16,407 --> 02:19:21,398
whoa yeah

630
02:19:23,168 --> 02:19:26,854
it's just a make it past it's not doing the
partitioning

631
02:19:30,475 --> 02:19:32,200
oh my God

632
02:19:35,088 --> 02:19:42,317
I don't know if I can accept this solution
here this is no a bunch of echo statements

633
02:19:42,849 --> 02:19:48,662
I know it's got to be something better than
that

634
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:51,562
no

635
02:19:52,420 --> 02:20:00,187
it is that the only thing that be okay and
that would make me use part in just that
that is not not cool

636
02:20:00,187 --> 02:20:08,909
I would not do that let me sit re-centered
input and that's so dangerous if they change
the commands and anyway

637
02:20:10,375 --> 02:20:12,153
yeah

638
02:20:14,286 --> 02:20:19,775
hey I just don't I think that would be
enough to make me his pardon

639
02:20:20,432 --> 02:20:23,174
so let's do another search

640
02:20:24,562 --> 02:20:29,270
I can make mac and light Lennox farted

641
02:20:30,054 --> 02:20:35,751
bad yellow I think you're right it's part of
this is relatively new I never learned it so

642
02:20:37,146 --> 02:20:44,316
we just read this one I didn't have any
automation using part of command this
message in the scraper Edition

643
02:20:46,181 --> 02:20:49,595
I mean we already did this one

644
02:20:51,155 --> 02:20:54,719
I'm sure is it something that I just don't
know the committee's

645
02:20:55,159 --> 02:21:00,015
he's right it's make part o that supported
command

646
02:21:00,843 --> 02:21:04,599
oh you have it above okay here we go

647
02:21:07,337 --> 02:21:10,605
all right I got to make I can make something
for that

648
02:21:14,499 --> 02:21:20,238
use of parted for creating

649
02:21:20,317 --> 02:21:24,086
Visions from Eli

650
02:21:27,075 --> 02:21:32,539
a boy hey how's it going nice post

651
02:21:36,737 --> 02:21:44,147
yeah I would not do stbf yeah run it

652
02:21:44,148 --> 02:21:46,958
yes but if they go warning here

653
02:22:20,237 --> 02:22:24,777
2048 sectors 4%

654
02:22:27,201 --> 02:22:29,515
only if you could do without sectors

655
02:22:29,980 --> 02:22:38,950
you can tell me our positions with some
great with purchasing fools like you being
other yes yeah I wouldn't be doing that
though in this case so yeah

656
02:23:11,735 --> 02:23:17,626
I mean and that's pretty much what beautiful
means but it depends on what system your own
butt

657
02:23:19,417 --> 02:23:26,115
all right that's a nice tool drip tip to
have I do kind of want to try it

658
02:23:26,767 --> 02:23:29,027
they're trying to remember s discs

659
02:23:32,995 --> 02:23:35,854
ssf2 spin around a while

660
02:23:39,919 --> 02:23:45,526
this planet might just be able to bring a
block of ice

661
02:23:45,893 --> 02:23:48,601
what would you use would use parted

662
02:23:52,661 --> 02:23:59,957
if you can take it if you would use pardon
or would you use something else

663
02:24:03,167 --> 02:24:05,955
what one would you prefer

664
02:24:09,933 --> 02:24:16,584
didn't realize that the starting over dishes
I accept this to ya lvm

665
02:24:18,252 --> 02:24:24,197
yeah but that's that's usually for more
significant volume set up straight I would
think

666
02:24:52,851 --> 02:24:59,167
all right sfjazz going to start it in two
partitions to walk devices

667
02:24:59,167 --> 02:25:02,828
are going away is not dispensing I start off
sets at all

668
02:25:15,754 --> 02:25:17,945
I see

669
02:25:21,168 --> 02:25:24,246
last time I did I script using.

670
02:25:24,247 --> 02:25:32,007
Yeah

671
02:25:39,271 --> 02:25:46,570
is parted s f disc

672
02:25:48,225 --> 02:25:51,510
and how would you do the same thing with
this up desk

673
02:25:52,507 --> 02:26:00,027
the ssf is allows or the same

674
02:26:17,444 --> 02:26:22,607
then what yeah yam

675
02:26:24,718 --> 02:26:28,980
yeah I'm trying to figure out how we would
do the same thing

676
02:26:28,981 --> 02:26:34,800
Jason holyshit then partition 7 Jason and
Jasonand Jason for men

677
02:26:36,161 --> 02:26:42,275
got I got to see that I have to see that in
use

678
02:26:46,129 --> 02:26:51,332
I just got news oh oh

679
02:26:51,906 --> 02:26:58,960
there's no except disc so there you go that
uses the curses Library

680
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:05,166
I'm going to I'm going to revise my
statement here

681
02:27:41,081 --> 02:27:48,261
why did I miss that oh well I got it wrong
thank you for catching that

682
02:27:48,761 --> 02:27:53,900
thank you for catching that I miss that you
guys love watching me make those kind of
mistakes I know

683
02:27:55,379 --> 02:28:03,214
because I don't read well as long as I'm
entertaining you with my stupidity

684
02:28:03,393 --> 02:28:08,588
as if disc Dev sdb

685
02:28:17,978 --> 02:28:23,353
to remember your latest a right then stb

686
02:28:24,778 --> 02:28:32,291
any credit you do 7 I think it's all command
line stuff shit

687
02:28:32,857 --> 02:28:34,799
I like it that

688
02:28:40,789 --> 02:28:43,435
I don't want now I want to know what the
option is

689
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:04,256
I want it now I have to figure out how to do
it how do we do this exact same thing in it
would be

690
02:29:06,135 --> 02:29:10,371
we probably have to cat into it pipe
something anyway I'm guessing

691
02:29:12,787 --> 02:29:17,519
her create a table yeah I guess is that's
true too

692
02:29:19,116 --> 02:29:25,183
I can try to get a table and it doesn't it
know it doesn't

693
02:29:26,337 --> 02:29:33,158
look at that that is kind of cool I mean
that is kind of cool

694
02:29:34,066 --> 02:29:38,507
you know I like about that is that you can
write up applications that went

695
02:29:39,210 --> 02:29:42,392
yes

696
02:29:45,805 --> 02:29:51,158
yeah I know how you would Adam and but that
would be I would be a thing

697
02:29:55,064 --> 02:29:58,166
that's if you prefer at this afternoon

698
02:30:33,941 --> 02:30:39,559
I can replace it with his help I think it'll
work where to find out

699
02:30:43,955 --> 02:30:45,625
find

700
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:52,177
there we go

701
02:30:56,806 --> 02:31:03,198
Bacchus or partition tables that's
interesting I hadn't even thought of that

702
02:31:03,427 --> 02:31:05,370
party

703
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:13,245
make sure your primary make sure you have
missed us

704
02:31:27,494 --> 02:31:31,042
yeah I kind of like that I kind of like it

705
02:31:37,043 --> 02:31:41,813
yeah yeah so

706
02:31:45,864 --> 02:31:52,567
then you can just dump it with us fdisk at
you later and used them to create a petition
again

707
02:31:54,448 --> 02:32:02,446
stack Overflow example yeah yes Krypton
version of Estes it's all part of you till
the next

708
02:32:02,719 --> 02:32:07,366
cuz I got to see Sylvia was the same person
table single partition

709
02:32:09,235 --> 02:32:14,183
you could put this in our notes inara
coloring notes

710
02:32:22,119 --> 02:32:25,889
God knows I ain't over do it with no taking
but

711
02:32:28,671 --> 02:32:32,984
I mean why not right if we're going to go
through the research might as well start
someplace

712
02:32:37,657 --> 02:32:39,799
115 sizer

713
02:32:41,514 --> 02:32:47,160
oh yeah of course if you're changing the
size not going to resize your stuff for you

714
02:32:47,620 --> 02:32:51,019
but if you see it as soon as you can dump
the petition layout

715
02:32:51,512 --> 02:32:58,664
r s t s s e y s interesting

716
02:32:59,277 --> 02:33:04,961
you're not using a GPD with this disc it is
not as a combination

717
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:19,429
sister has been an assistant for CPT include
G disc and S U disc or Char. Just have to
skin Essentials

718
02:33:23,331 --> 02:33:30,078
seems like there's a little bit of a
competition between them I said just use
descriptive version of fdisk

719
02:33:30,078 --> 02:33:36,474
as part of your Tales Lennox version table
the single Jason Takes a whole District
rating with

720
02:33:36,611 --> 02:33:42,676
as you at the funeral where can I purchase
do it's been below

721
02:33:42,716 --> 02:33:48,788
s f disc hip hop point of my Lenovo equals
blah

722
02:33:48,789 --> 02:33:53,509
interested if I can apply it with sgx

723
02:33:55,005 --> 02:34:01,823
with Sudoku oh you can type the whole thing
shut

724
02:34:05,467 --> 02:34:16,249
we happen to be the actual partition table
that's that's kind of interesting but you
can just admit it by saying she's a lot
types of line

725
02:34:17,347 --> 02:34:20,380
start size type of animal

726
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:26,213
and you can set bootable so I don't know
what I'm saying here and B are supported

727
02:34:29,725 --> 02:34:37,165
yep I had a feeling you know that it's not
as straightforward

728
02:34:38,576 --> 02:34:45,330
you know in part it seems like it has

729
02:34:45,331 --> 02:34:56,733
a command that you can use it like gives you
what you want I feel like you have to create
a file for us up disk and you afford it to
it which is totally fine too it's just a
different thing right

730
02:34:57,372 --> 02:35:04,470
I just sent you two I haven't known about it
I'm just discovering it was just when I'm
spending too much time on it

731
02:35:05,516 --> 02:35:09,980
it is such a secondary sector 15 in cat

732
02:35:09,982 --> 02:35:21,693
a some a different you know what I'm going
to say something I should probably take the
time to set up an Arch Linux distro from
scratch I should probably do that this isn't
a learning exercise because

733
02:35:21,695 --> 02:35:27,828
so many of the tools that I grew up with are
irrelevant now like at disc

734
02:35:27,855 --> 02:35:35,327
and so it should work yeah it is just one
line so yeah

735
02:35:35,594 --> 02:35:43,460
yet for this particular one right sidestep 7
bootable

736
02:35:43,460 --> 02:35:46,847
I mean to send taxes a little hairier

737
02:35:52,012 --> 02:35:55,099
Tempo formats a genericthe generic header
lines

738
02:35:59,882 --> 02:36:05,976
that referral Bridges oh God I'm not doing
this that's stupid

739
02:36:07,487 --> 02:36:15,250
list all expect running expect script to
make a partition you fucking kidding me okay

740
02:36:16,830 --> 02:36:38,050
delete hacker method of doing for expecting
a four digits no fuck know that's crazy is
really crazy oh my God this is so this is a
perfect example of Stock Exchange look at
this is the most popular answer and it's a
disaster

741
02:36:39,696 --> 02:36:47,379
oh my God it's so bad and it's the most
upvoted one

742
02:36:49,423 --> 02:36:53,950
oh my God they give you for that

743
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:35,363
I thought that was a good idea I mean even
the shell script is kind of bad oh God

744
02:37:35,837 --> 02:37:40,301
it's is provided a sense of enjoyment for me
today and made me laugh

745
02:37:49,499 --> 02:37:50,745
yeah

746
02:37:56,423 --> 02:38:04,361
what's the question that was above the
answer was was was with the layout which one
was it was somebody right

747
02:38:06,273 --> 02:38:13,697
yeah is it kind of too

748
02:38:24,722 --> 02:38:28,301
it I want it I want to do something here I
want to

749
02:38:46,335 --> 02:38:48,315
is assef

750
02:39:15,319 --> 02:39:21,978
bunting I was afraid of that I was reading
that

751
02:39:22,929 --> 02:39:24,723
trip to do

752
02:39:30,664 --> 02:39:34,978
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

753
02:39:35,617 --> 02:39:38,698
3235

754
02:39:54,997 --> 02:40:00,807
set link s f disc

755
02:40:06,426 --> 02:40:13,588
all right yes yes please all right and then
you get

756
02:40:14,239 --> 02:40:26,229
I got those notes

757
02:40:26,531 --> 02:40:34,415
thank you for that this is like I'm going to
go back to something again I take an
unusually large amount of notes because it
helps me remember

758
02:40:33,106 --> 02:40:39,638
it helps me remember stuff that are and then
I can go back and find it more easily than
just a bunch of random bookmarks

759
02:40:40,638 --> 02:40:45,516
how many vaccines go back to your bookmarks
and search for things I don't

760
02:40:48,465 --> 02:41:16,522
so let's do this let's see I mean I I've
satisfied my my urge to partition that I
don't even need to as LBG has told us we can
just use the makeup s option And the fact I
want to use a better format for this we
actually should probably use make a fuss
type t e x t 4 that's the more supportive
way to do this

761
02:41:20,116 --> 02:41:26,204
okay just say format

762
02:41:27,411 --> 02:41:32,555
lion would make it fast no partition needed

763
02:41:37,861 --> 02:41:44,216
and I appreciate you bringing that to my
attention I would never have thought of that
by default

764
02:41:46,476 --> 02:41:49,227
I would never have thought of that by
default

765
02:41:59,498 --> 02:42:00,870
okay

766
02:42:04,949 --> 02:42:14,293
so are we are we are at this great whatever

767
02:42:14,556 --> 02:42:20,730
raise volume two points anything with makeup
best

768
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:30,387
remind me just because he's a protector yeah
people keep saying that no parts

769
02:42:31,155 --> 02:42:34,333
or boot sector needed

770
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:40,119
thanks for that Frank that's a good note
let's make sure that's in her notes

771
02:42:42,059 --> 02:42:48,335
if we do I mean that's most beginners are
not going to know that they don't know what
it what sector is

772
02:42:48,530 --> 02:42:54,794
yeah it it was kind of freaked me the fuck
out doing you know Dennis EB

773
02:42:54,940 --> 02:43:04,415
and I've gotten so paranoid about doing
Tennessee letter anything over the years
because that's the parent disc to the
partition

774
02:43:04,417 --> 02:43:18,233
yeah I mean it's like it's pretty common to
do different commands to the partition with
a number at the end and when is it like
major major faux pas as you might make his
assistant men is forgetting the number at
the end

775
02:43:18,236 --> 02:43:51,708
because what happens right so let's say
let's say you have a hard drive and it's got
five partitions on edge and you want to
format one of the specific partitions you
want to reformat or you want to clear it up
for swap space you want to release it
whatever right so he went to resize it so
you do whatever the command is and you point
it at the SD be 1 or 2 or 10 or 3 and I've
done it that's why I'm so paranoid about it
that that's why I'm so paranoid about it and
encouraging

776
02:43:51,878 --> 02:44:27,099
if that guy just talked myself into
partitioning anyway because if a beginner
sees this and then they they think that they
don't need to indicate the partition the
chances of actually doing this command on a
volume that has not been partitioned even if
it only has a single partition is very low
and I would rather not encourage people to
drop the numbers from the end as a present
at our practice because they all as soon as
you do that you are going to fuck yourself
over and everybody knows we'll have it so so
as cool as it is that you can do that

777
02:44:27,102 --> 02:44:38,409
I think it's kind of going against the grain
so maybe it's more acceptable in the world
of virtualization where volumes as I said or
you know could be done

778
02:44:38,410 --> 02:44:43,717
I'm going to actually make a comment on this
on this this this thing that I said

779
02:44:47,706 --> 02:44:53,587
because I'm really really glad that I'll
meet you showed us about that trick but

780
02:45:07,544 --> 02:45:14,189
yeah but should I you drop

781
02:45:12,991 --> 02:45:16,407
drop partitioning

782
02:45:24,066 --> 02:45:26,839
34 Frederick Street

783
02:45:37,361 --> 02:45:47,707
one of the only ways one of the many ways a
beginner like me once upon a time

784
02:45:48,709 --> 02:45:55,360
I can destroy a perfectly good disc

785
02:45:55,550 --> 02:46:03,333
is to leave off the number of the partition

786
02:46:06,285 --> 02:46:08,377
Deb S TV

787
02:46:08,903 --> 02:46:15,126
instead of death stb-1

788
02:46:22,083 --> 02:46:26,454
for this reason I feel

789
02:46:27,388 --> 02:46:37,515
I ain't taking the unnecessary step of
creating a single partition for the entire

790
02:46:39,125 --> 02:46:48,584
Dr will seem more normal two admins old and
young

791
02:46:51,126 --> 02:46:52,948
I'm not sure

792
02:46:53,383 --> 02:47:02,740
I want to encourage people to ever stop
paying attention to the numbers

793
02:47:03,452 --> 02:47:11,629
of the partitions just for the sake just for
the safety net

794
02:47:12,156 --> 02:47:14,319
it provides

795
02:47:17,162 --> 02:47:26,037
before work a tension is absolutely of
course using lsblk is definite

796
02:47:26,227 --> 02:47:38,282
play the way to go to avoid all of this
confusion but having a partition table

797
02:47:40,898 --> 02:47:47,527
I might still avoid some mishaps

798
02:47:47,806 --> 02:47:53,700
why not as using icat and logic

799
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:57,333
what we talked about code there's no code
here

800
02:47:57,699 --> 02:48:04,010
this this is Mark down mister cat hate Kenny
logic this is what you need to do

801
02:48:04,558 --> 02:48:20,579
yeah but you didn't finish this other stuff
so you should probably go do the Boost
there's a there's 45 minutes 45 hours of or
more of a video booths there that will catch
you up to everything we're doing here.
Everything good

802
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:27,901
is it for the boot sector for bring some
text Pac-Man in 512 flight said so cool

803
02:48:29,273 --> 02:48:34,404
super cool so

804
02:48:35,698 --> 02:48:39,084
has been for going to do this

805
02:48:40,292 --> 02:48:44,764
I feel like I feel I feel better writing
that

806
02:48:45,203 --> 02:48:49,112
that's all that matters I do a Wonder though

807
02:48:49,936 --> 02:48:56,706
but let's try let's try automating it this
is all marked down yet just coming work work
town

808
02:48:57,501 --> 02:49:07,730
a partition cell produces a different thing
predictions are just talking about how to
how to chop up your disk drives and create
different partitions

809
02:49:08,598 --> 02:49:15,677
which is part of infrastructure engineering
oh I got this pretty cool

810
02:49:35,247 --> 02:49:37,772
all right let's do

811
02:49:42,102 --> 02:49:48,019
I am trying to redo this actually

812
02:49:50,838 --> 02:49:55,856
I want to kill that petition and and mount

813
02:49:58,655 --> 02:50:06,531
I whoops and I'm going to actually delete it

814
02:50:09,469 --> 02:50:11,519
or or put something else on it

815
02:50:12,066 --> 02:50:20,387
let's try our petition command that we were
playing with us try lbg's departed command

816
02:50:20,623 --> 02:50:28,065
let's try that was Joey so animal primary

817
02:50:29,383 --> 02:50:35,755
SUV make part primary okay we want

818
02:50:36,178 --> 02:50:43,460
all 10 MB so do we actually have to indicate
how much of it

819
02:50:44,494 --> 02:50:48,748
I could get it to hundred percent can't we a
strike

820
02:50:48,843 --> 02:50:54,724
is it good thing I would not test on
anything but a VM but we're on a VMware
virtual volumes or fine

821
02:50:59,934 --> 02:51:06,787
oh that's not good

822
02:51:08,134 --> 02:51:14,633
make label MS-DOS drop this

823
02:51:16,482 --> 02:51:23,737
and I'll talk Infirmary houses in New York
City to ha

824
02:51:25,859 --> 02:51:32,931
this NFL season 5 fc2

825
02:51:39,661 --> 02:51:41,772
I'm part 1 start

826
02:51:51,289 --> 02:51:53,727
make level made the partition table

827
02:51:56,200 --> 02:52:03,406
62 okay do these are commands that it sends
to him I see

828
02:52:06,404 --> 02:52:11,700
04 or is it Linux Linux right

829
02:52:12,249 --> 02:52:19,053
and damn it how do I find out what take as
it is the xt4

830
02:52:21,468 --> 02:52:28,873
you just label I just label type what's in
Cambodia

831
02:52:30,522 --> 02:52:37,399
I don't know I'm going to go do it
interactively and then I'll figure out the
command now that I understand that they're
just commands

832
02:52:38,682 --> 02:52:40,323
so

833
02:52:43,769 --> 02:52:51,469
has a basement okay I'll see you make label
you just label time

834
02:52:52,467 --> 02:52:57,164
how do we list all the labels I know how to
do this would have just got to know how to
do it here

835
02:53:00,459 --> 02:53:07,569
and I'll token I know I need to read about
it I haven't read anything about it

836
02:53:13,479 --> 02:53:17,802
help I think I'm already stuck in one

837
02:53:20,038 --> 02:53:22,013
yeah I can't

838
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:28,578
sales are expected to sell out game help

839
02:53:29,607 --> 02:53:35,739
I never responded ever in my life so make
level

840
02:53:35,739 --> 02:53:42,554
can you just go Fishin I will type as one of
Atari i x PSG sun or Lube

841
02:53:43,358 --> 02:53:45,654
if I can get Amy

842
02:53:47,446 --> 02:53:53,979
we can do labor if imma do Looper gptm
thinking why would it be a mustache

843
02:53:54,009 --> 02:54:00,802
no it isn't us it is essentially is because
I remember that this could doing that

844
02:54:02,266 --> 02:54:07,249
a clamble and estas Knox

845
02:54:11,248 --> 02:54:17,201
warning system disabled on us to be able to
destroy all day on this will be lost you
want to continue yes

846
02:54:19,421 --> 02:54:28,314
I see this doesn't wanted a time this
doesn't like and I'll give you options be
outside so next we need to do

847
02:54:34,295 --> 02:54:36,996
thenthen pardon dash s

848
02:54:47,883 --> 02:54:53,871
does it read the lines in without the quotes
shit that is awesome

849
02:54:54,461 --> 02:54:59,987
that is awesome I would not have guessed
that make part

850
02:55:01,249 --> 02:55:06,707
make Park Primary ext4

851
02:55:08,387 --> 02:55:15,793
what are 2048 that's the sector's right lb *
4 can we do can we have a gig

852
02:55:20,902 --> 02:55:22,680
I wonder if we can do gig

853
02:55:27,213 --> 02:55:35,009
I mean that's going to make a specific
position size I want to use that have used
to hold the whole disk I wonder how that is

854
02:55:37,888 --> 02:55:43,689
I don't know

855
02:55:44,271 --> 02:55:50,821
110 G it doesn't probably do that anyway the
sector's probably right

856
02:55:51,542 --> 02:55:56,085
I mean it's money manager that this
yesterday I can say hey how big is that use
the whole thing

857
02:55:58,174 --> 02:56:04,255
oh that's the start I do that's the
beginning sector location how would you even
figure that out

858
02:56:07,445 --> 02:56:10,271
it had to like Melissa petition people
already

859
02:56:13,295 --> 02:56:15,601
is starsector in sector

860
02:56:19,279 --> 02:56:24,776
you bet how did you know to skip over is
that the nbar size 2048 sectors

861
02:56:25,530 --> 02:56:32,006
what where is the 24th coming from Ice Cream
all the time

862
02:56:33,333 --> 02:56:40,725
I go on and off all the time it's going to
be all right as soon as 24 days pretty
standard

863
02:56:42,185 --> 02:56:45,918
and if you can't do it that has a 512 MB

864
02:56:46,203 --> 02:56:50,920
or fights whatever it is what what's the
standard and BR size I can't remember

865
02:56:51,511 --> 02:57:01,828
the basic it's a bad idea to write directly
to the beginning of this evidence to the
volume. Right because it's the partition
table itself gets written there

866
02:57:04,286 --> 02:57:10,965
I'm wondering if part of that actually let
you write over the partition table to be in
and that would be really bad news right

867
02:57:11,651 --> 02:57:13,561
what are the main desk

868
02:57:14,512 --> 02:57:20,744
I'm just wondering how I would know that
it's probably a standard number and we can
just use that kind of all the time

869
02:57:21,479 --> 02:57:24,202
iHeartRadio is greater than p

870
02:57:26,930 --> 02:57:36,141
so 2048 sectors I think it's pretty much
basic right as it started and then we went
to 10% so

871
02:57:39,268 --> 02:57:46,713
waiting about fair play name the sounds of
music

872
02:57:46,998 --> 02:57:49,175
how are you

873
02:57:53,071 --> 02:57:56,964
let's see how so we need to do

874
02:58:10,296 --> 02:58:14,761
Michigan say create great the devil on
version

875
02:58:20,018 --> 02:58:22,969
it's done defeating a man

876
02:58:25,653 --> 02:58:35,182
well that's nice that has some of the
commands right it's probably that nothing is
going to write a ride I'll be a Flags
started 1049 KB

877
02:58:35,989 --> 02:58:38,128
how's it going

878
02:58:38,593 --> 02:58:44,207
isn't really a language this is just a bunch
of stuff

879
02:58:45,519 --> 02:58:51,276
yeah we're using 1X and we're doing part of
partitioning and bunches

880
02:58:52,903 --> 02:59:04,162
Michelle was the best answer I can give you
a shelf we're just we're doing right now
we're doing a little bit of Ruby a little
bit of Ash

881
02:59:04,164 --> 02:59:11,108
little bit of some domain specific languages
for these tools like party so let's see here

882
02:59:11,148 --> 02:59:18,739
it said he write it I bet it does at my exit
Emmett how do I exit

883
02:59:19,478 --> 02:59:21,871
I've never she's part is Donna

884
02:59:23,435 --> 02:59:30,564
the language of English is it cute

885
02:59:31,485 --> 02:59:35,202
be okay they want me to update I-77 my own

886
02:59:35,902 --> 02:59:39,956
I don't fucking want to fuck with a Vista
please tell me I don't have to do that

887
02:59:43,373 --> 02:59:45,437
oh my God I'm going to have to

888
02:59:46,324 --> 02:59:53,793
on this is doesn't mean it but this will
happen when you do melting and stuff yeah
that's that's next that's after me Mountain
stuff

889
02:59:54,504 --> 03:00:01,708
there you go that's what you wanted so they
can most definitely be scripted

890
03:00:04,309 --> 03:00:07,604
can only capture that that specific

891
03:00:13,105 --> 03:00:20,629
I think and I want to write about the okay

892
03:00:26,159 --> 03:00:27,930
I'm going to write about this

893
03:00:34,530 --> 03:00:39,058
block storage device volume

894
03:00:41,253 --> 03:00:42,940
Rob volume

895
03:00:47,568 --> 03:00:52,444
the commands are surrounded by

896
03:00:53,125 --> 03:01:00,224
quotes but don't necessarily have to be

897
03:01:01,407 --> 03:01:07,266
lgbtq what do you use a hard disk greater
than 4 terabytes

898
03:01:08,832 --> 03:01:14,724
yes I kind of want to play with that

899
03:01:16,424 --> 03:01:22,438
if I could be a time after you partition a
USB stick yeah

900
03:01:23,128 --> 03:01:24,714
at suck

901
03:01:33,906 --> 03:01:40,633
and this toss creates the Shannon table

902
03:01:53,847 --> 03:01:56,165
C make part

903
03:02:07,543 --> 03:02:12,414
creates the mission

904
03:02:12,681 --> 03:02:18,676
as a race a primary partition

905
03:02:20,975 --> 03:02:27,831
which can hold other partitions if you want
later

906
03:02:29,630 --> 03:02:36,047
that begins starts at

907
03:02:37,302 --> 03:02:39,415
28

908
03:03:00,661 --> 03:03:08,205
and Phyl's of the disk volume

909
03:03:12,552 --> 03:03:19,956
fraction operations repeat it has
interesting

910
03:03:20,184 --> 03:03:24,399
I did not know that I'm learning a lot about
Furnishing again

911
03:03:26,063 --> 03:03:29,574
and it just feels SS which spent more come.

912
03:03:34,167 --> 03:03:43,618
It was you saying Okay so

913
03:03:50,129 --> 03:03:54,455
I was going to find the lab on this I'm
willing to I'm willing to

914
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:04,961
yes all right so notes on that or updated

915
03:04:06,073 --> 03:04:11,849
we have a desk frame

916
03:04:14,942 --> 03:04:18,746
you can actually put all the commands on the
same line just remove the thing on your dog

917
03:04:20,878 --> 03:04:23,168
what is a semicolon screwing us up

918
03:04:35,713 --> 03:04:37,253
oh what's

919
03:04:40,964 --> 03:04:47,181
and now it's soaking house that invalid
token yeah

920
03:04:51,317 --> 03:04:56,342
yes oh we're going to put an F in here to
force it right

921
03:04:58,426 --> 03:05:11,966
if we need to do

922
03:05:13,979 --> 03:05:20,353
watching crime shows out besides with the
Davion default yep

923
03:05:20,769 --> 03:05:45,025
yeah but I mean yeah I use it they made a
false ID IP Lux encryption all that stuff I
default with the installers at setting up
your own discs is a very unique thing but
it's something I need to do for the NFS oh
so you know I'm doing a testing is kind of a
lost art of to that you know it's not
something people do it's it's kind of taken
care of for you

924
03:05:48,727 --> 03:05:54,913
are you trying to show me oh boy

925
03:05:55,602 --> 03:06:02,747
that looks like it did yeah

926
03:06:28,273 --> 03:06:41,598
all in 1 hour to get a line right yeah but
but I we learned a ton in the process right
I mean I know about part it I know that I
can be able to that's a pretty pretty

927
03:06:41,600 --> 03:07:17,065
a pretty simple and intuitive lying to set
up a volume petition and I really appreciate
that we figured this out the script volume
partitioning is fucking amazing I'm really
glad I learned it I know where to go back
for it now I'm not going to go deep dive
into partitioning just right now but I know
where the information is and what to look
for and as an operations person as you guys
are well know that's half the battle half
the battle is knowing that parted in l s b k
in on those kinds of things even exist right

928
03:07:31,276 --> 03:07:34,153
Mexican run this when they came out here

929
03:07:36,999 --> 03:07:43,688
no I don't want to do that I don't have it I
don't have to be here nevermind I give up

930
03:07:58,542 --> 03:08:00,441
god dammit

931
03:08:05,076 --> 03:08:06,749
god dammit

932
03:08:11,469 --> 03:08:13,245
there

933
03:08:28,070 --> 03:08:30,573
Nash s

934
03:08:41,725 --> 03:08:44,553
now we need that it doesn't matter Glee

935
03:08:50,833 --> 03:08:57,987
alright so yeah I think it's at the file
system after system

936
03:09:09,026 --> 03:09:18,304
and I just got here facing yes yes I'm stack
exchange oh God yes I am like rooting out
the shit that doesn't work you know

937
03:09:18,528 --> 03:09:19,976
after primary

938
03:09:26,218 --> 03:09:30,947
does any car has to be careful

939
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:46,633
oh wait wait wait yes Maniac C4

940
03:09:48,228 --> 03:09:54,575
yep when are you sure

941
03:10:03,273 --> 03:10:05,027
that even work

942
03:10:15,332 --> 03:10:22,647
it's optional what I see

943
03:10:25,633 --> 03:10:28,465
that's what that that's optional was
definitely capture that

944
03:10:37,645 --> 03:10:38,997
yeah

945
03:10:55,659 --> 03:11:03,034
medicine wait a second when you do did that
the dent do it implied make of this

946
03:11:04,033 --> 03:11:10,980
it did right shit it didn't quite make a
mess

947
03:11:20,825 --> 03:11:24,174
I think I do we still have to do with your
weight loss check dad

948
03:11:26,624 --> 03:11:34,395
I mean the only reason you would put that
there it was to say hey this is the type of
file system that is intended

949
03:11:37,482 --> 03:11:46,739
but still yeah has to be formatted with

950
03:11:49,127 --> 03:11:55,189
without that could really throw a beginner

951
03:11:55,208 --> 03:12:01,404
they can really throw him again we got to
make sure you cover that it's like hey I put
a text before I went in to make it ext4

952
03:12:01,634 --> 03:12:08,286
visiting form after this can write you need
to make an epicenter I just just make the
volume but it says hey you know

953
03:12:17,775 --> 03:12:23,561
is great that is a size intended

954
03:12:36,226 --> 03:12:38,265
alright so

955
03:12:58,723 --> 03:13:01,189
alright so yeah

956
03:13:03,905 --> 03:13:14,422
is makes a mortician it doesn't fill ya in
Everwood right I just I think it's important
we pointed out the beginners because when
they get what's your excuse for I said
that's a file system in a tank but I thought
this was just

957
03:13:13,179 --> 03:13:19,220
this was just partitioning it didn't have
any file system stuff inside yeah that's
right it's just an informational field of
the partition table

958
03:13:22,152 --> 03:13:30,205
nothing stopping you from putting an
informational fill the partition table
Linens and in formatting with a completely
new Partition so

959
03:13:30,921 --> 03:13:38,148
you know I beginner needs to hear then or me
after 20 years Cersei

960
03:13:39,231 --> 03:13:43,930
I want to say it's been 20 know that's not
true

961
03:13:44,377 --> 03:14:04,010
that's not true because I was doing a bunch
of USB partitioning and making disk using
actually Mac command line for adjusting tool
that's the last time I was messing with
projections by 2014 is e l s

962
03:14:05,977 --> 03:14:13,151
I sent a response Redemption tag I thought
about that I don't know that's interesting I
don't know

963
03:14:14,534 --> 03:14:19,218
it doesn't build out their Festival a reason
to be treated as a male

964
03:14:23,470 --> 03:14:33,248
I am a little bit interested to get into why
that we're only starting the volume on 2048
sector which is like you know 10:24 or so

965
03:14:33,950 --> 03:14:50,840
I know that we're just giving space for
producing Tales of some of the beginning or
volume information the beginning the
partition table itself is getting written to
the beginning of the desk and I think
there's a standard size there and I I don't
know I think it probably depends on the
petition type as well

966
03:14:51,055 --> 03:14:57,814
or did they all just comply with the
standard size so that starting number the
starting number 24 dates actors

967
03:14:57,971 --> 03:15:06,597
is that standard across all partitions are
all partitioning you know architectures

968
03:15:07,047 --> 03:15:23,605
I think it is I think it is because I've
seen it everywhere every time you ever going
to use that this or something like that it
says where am I going to start and then it
automatically starts you at that spot
because it's already written vertically or
whatever to the beginning of the volume

969
03:15:23,608 --> 03:15:30,084
nnn the stuff is ready to begin the volume
of thing is done by the provisioner

970
03:15:30,085 --> 03:15:31,953
I don't know that though

971
03:15:31,953 --> 03:15:38,208
so I'm super interested to know about that
like what's going on at the very very
beginning of the disc

972
03:15:38,595 --> 03:15:41,077
High b key

973
03:15:44,131 --> 03:15:50,639
Artisan have boxes by 12 for k b Finney on
her again yep

974
03:15:51,301 --> 03:15:58,167
yes b o b

975
03:15:59,553 --> 03:16:02,594
January B yes

976
03:16:02,690 --> 03:16:19,284
is like a human size probably too much over
yet I understand why we have to skip that
passed 2048 sectors and I'm almost positive
that it's a partition table but I don't know
them

977
03:16:19,286 --> 03:16:25,140
self with a box eyes

978
03:16:26,543 --> 03:16:28,647
yes

979
03:16:30,208 --> 03:16:38,854
and I think the first block or two is is
like if you want it but it wouldn't want to
know is that leave room for an MPR few want
one

980
03:16:38,854 --> 03:16:48,575
like if you were to make it bootable in
front of me are on there later this is that
does that save enough space for that to be
at a later you have to go full report isshin

981
03:16:48,577 --> 03:16:56,038
I know that this isn't it might be I do feel
like it's

982
03:16:56,038 --> 03:17:01,148
it's like hey we're not going to touch the
beginning of the discus with all kinds of
shit going on the beginning

983
03:17:02,093 --> 03:17:06,678
Carowinds just read GTA software engineering
a kingslayer

984
03:17:06,681 --> 03:17:10,911
yeah we do bunch of shit here welcome can
see you

985
03:17:14,148 --> 03:17:20,130
you got any answer for us already oh God

986
03:17:20,243 --> 03:17:22,930
oh God

987
03:17:23,109 --> 03:17:40,672
because you'll just a additional utilities
that's the only substance is used to sleep
that use the same to me didn't try climate
using entire fake this geometry that you see
reopened and your do this has been or is
partitioned man you are utility Alliance one
megabyte boundaries instead

988
03:17:40,675 --> 03:17:47,192
I see yeah my you found it right away

989
03:17:47,333 --> 03:17:54,248
what is Medusa's story 24 days of 63 there
it is right there on 2nd Street

990
03:17:52,911 --> 03:17:56,807
restaurant Stock Exchange you found it so
fast

991
03:17:58,874 --> 03:18:00,958
I'm going to write a thing about that though

992
03:18:54,407 --> 03:18:57,344
10% I know I was just going to say

993
03:18:57,854 --> 03:19:02,444
that's why I was like I'm already down to 9%
of my MB of disk right

994
03:19:04,692 --> 03:19:06,978
by making a partition table

995
03:19:11,025 --> 03:19:17,685
if I had made it a volume I would have got
all 10 GB right yeah

996
03:19:18,513 --> 03:19:25,349
I see you're saying Physicians are bloat
yeah they are

997
03:19:26,705 --> 03:19:29,617
so that's interesting

998
03:19:30,922 --> 03:19:39,256
I like what you're saying there that's
actually part of that other idea that we
were talking about I want to capture that so

999
03:19:54,491 --> 03:20:01,232
on the other hand rotisserie chickens

1000
03:20:01,963 --> 03:20:03,861
cause bloat

1001
03:20:07,303 --> 03:20:11,942
because of old conventions about

1002
03:20:12,915 --> 03:20:18,705
about when the partition about where the
position can be in

1003
03:20:21,652 --> 03:20:26,271
obviously in a terabyte

1004
03:20:30,476 --> 03:20:38,329
Discworld such things are not that big of a
concern

1005
03:20:39,449 --> 03:20:51,370
but if for any reason you are constrained on
disk space you might want to drop

1006
03:20:51,890 --> 03:20:56,750
partitions all together and just

1007
03:20:58,064 --> 03:21:01,649
format the volume directly

1008
03:21:08,410 --> 03:21:16,038
yeah podesta flag

1009
03:21:23,821 --> 03:21:25,588
did you do

1010
03:21:30,143 --> 03:21:35,438
bring your own practice Yeah

1011
03:21:36,336 --> 03:21:59,458
we've been talked about that a lot that's
pretty common kingslayer it's pretty common
topic colleges teach you Theory and you
don't have any practical stuff if you need
to learn practical stuff like how to get a
job and you can read he's in the next like
that you got to supplement your learning
somehow and one of those ways to boost but
mostly it's just practicing what should
making your own stuff

1012
03:21:59,571 --> 03:22:34,444
yeah it you probably most people prefer
practical learning cuz it's the natural way
to learn learning theory from a book and
read about it is not it's not natural sew-in
people prefer to experiment try things out
and then come back and read about stuff to
fill the gaps as comprehensive learning most
people that's the natural and do things cuz
that's how we learned as a kid that's how
nature does learning and colleges don't do
that they don't let me know if that based on
Theory cuz I can't keep up with the
Practical applications of that theory
because it changes too quickly so they still
your money and

1013
03:22:32,997 --> 03:22:38,051
steal your money and teach you Theory and
leave you without the ability to pay the
money back cuz you don't have the fucking
job

1014
03:22:38,583 --> 03:23:22,720
so I don't know what to tell you except for
make sure you supplement whatever you're
doing in college with a bunch of practical
learning that you do on your own and learn
how to figure out how to manage your
learning on your own because if you don't
learn that fucking any job because all jobs
require you to learn practical skills on the
job all the time and if you don't learn that
you'll fail so make sure you learn it and
the best way to learn is is jump in and do
it you already know how to do it by the way
it's built into you pretty much I talk about
this on the first the first the second day
of the Boost Labs yeah I just have a saying
learning happens in the lab not the lecture
hall

1015
03:23:23,030 --> 03:23:39,664
I'm sad again learning happens in the lab
not the lecture hall what I'm doing right
now is crazy good for my learning because
I'm experimenting I'm testing I'm
collaborating with other people while we do
it just like serious fucking learning
happening right now

1016
03:23:40,056 --> 03:23:50,138
if I were to read a book about this about
how to set up an offense Alyssa if I would
not get nearly as much practical inside from
all the other people that have done it
running is also collaborative

1017
03:23:50,429 --> 03:23:56,468
this bunch of shit that's just totally wrong
it's not competitive learning its
collaborative it's not competitive

1018
03:23:56,468 --> 03:24:35,213
you said you sent people against each other
in a college classroom stick on a fucking
bill curve cost of the competition so they
don't ever fucking help each other unless
they go out of their way to do like you know
coating do you like things but it sets up
this antagonistic situation between the
teacher and the student in between the
student in this student is totally fucked up
it's totally totally fucked up and you end
of the world thinking that that's how you
should go about learning to do you send your
cubicle and you have great knowledge you
don't ever share with anybody else so you
don't ask somebody real somebody else and
they beat you down because they're competing
against you for the job to get a raise every
thing and it and there's a scarcity
mentality it's all totally totally freaked
out

1019
03:24:35,238 --> 03:24:47,733
throw that off if you want to learning
community like ours or another one learn how
to learn on your own and just flip the fuck
off every other educational institution that
is trying to steal your money

1020
03:24:50,103 --> 03:25:03,635
it's true it's you don't you think it's not
your raise your hand if you have run into a
technocrat in it in the it profession who
doesn't share shit because they're afraid
you're going to get a job we're going to do
better than them

1021
03:25:04,492 --> 03:25:18,496
I've met so many of these people it's
obscene and you know it's just downright
wrong as this is scarcity mentality if you
succeed that means I'm not going to succeed
totally fucked up

1022
03:25:18,499 --> 03:25:23,073
all right I'm going to go away now let me
get myself talking about I get mad

1023
03:25:25,384 --> 03:25:34,154
that's enough for that when my life right so
let's go get some notes Here the idea of you
know I know

1024
03:25:34,154 --> 03:25:58,610
so kingslayer the first of all takes take
heart and knowing that you do not need to be
afraid you don't need to be afraid the whole
system would have you be full of fear fear
of trying to learn fear of getting the wrong
grade fear of being in the wrong major for
going to run school if they are learning the
wrong thing they want you to do that because
they have control over you

1025
03:25:58,612 --> 03:26:12,418
so drop the fear I know I have had to fight
against the fear to myself I was terrified
when I got hired for this job I didn't know
anything about Community Center stardew
kubernetes if you only knew I could learn it
and you know why they hired me

1026
03:26:12,419 --> 03:26:20,505
I have to keep reminding myself of this they
hired me because I had my CV was Chuck full
of proof

1027
03:26:20,507 --> 03:26:38,581
that I have taught myself and learn how to
learn that's why they hired me that's why
they hired me I told him point-blank and
interview is a very cushy job and I told him
point-blank an interview I have zero Docker
kubernetes experience and the position was a
doctor in kubernetes admin

1028
03:26:38,582 --> 03:26:45,609
and it's a don't worry you'll learn it don't
worry you'll learn it a mic

1029
03:26:45,610 --> 03:26:56,596
they had seen my vastu yet they had they had
seen my videos and I had had they had had
somebody from the videos a friend of mine
now

1030
03:26:56,597 --> 03:27:14,413
go to them and say you would be a fool if
you didn't hide those exact words to be a
fool if you didn't hire this guy and that's
how you get a job you get a job by creating
trust with other people are going to
recommend you because it bypasses HR and all
that shit and number two I don't care if
it's downdraft or not if they're going to
hire me for my

1031
03:27:13,197 --> 03:27:17,135
if you're going to hire me for my personal
rants on Twitch, I don't want to work for
them

1032
03:27:17,475 --> 03:27:26,908
I don't want to work and defense against
standards stuff by and seeing that there are
at least two independent limitation of The
Sinner interesting

1033
03:27:27,453 --> 03:27:47,954
standard something that's super interesting
you run into technocrats and different
contacts people to try to land their
company's Solutions standard while all the
other Solutions while they need a couple
years to migrate and keeping on some of the
bigger companies to write so I really liked
what they taught

1034
03:27:48,597 --> 03:28:02,905
I have a fucking Russian major you think my
Russian major got me my job know I'm a
liberal arts major for one of the most
technical positions you could ever get hired
for

1035
03:28:03,514 --> 03:28:24,987
education system has such a big fuss about
cheating oh got ya memorization for this is
these are the standard complaint points from
Paula Ferry end and can Robinson never said
they want to do that's because that's where
they have all the power if you're just a
memorization machine they have all the power
and they can charge you money to certify

1036
03:28:25,019 --> 03:28:32,131
yeah you can erase everything nope you can't
every man for themselves ever going to find
a messenger again

1037
03:28:32,848 --> 03:28:35,846
because that's the system that they want you
know

1038
03:28:36,522 --> 03:28:49,758
effectively gate keep you out of your
control points and that's what we're finding
is right at right so that's a great rant
binary if you can't rent here look I just
want you to know something

1039
03:28:49,762 --> 03:29:50,369
this cement okay this community I'm trying
really hard to make it a safe space am I
going to ban you and time you out and get on
your case if you you know if I feel attacked
probably am I going to cool off I'm going to
make tons of mistakes along the way but
overall I want you to know this community is
a safe space for you to learn now we are
going to push you we're not this is some
mamby pamby like snowflake shit if you fuck
up by doing something that you could have
answered in two seconds on your own we're
going to get your shit about it but it's
good for you it's good for you when I kind
of I mean if we're meeting with you it's
because we love you and I know that sounds
horrible to say but it's true because if you
go into some if you if you wander into some
random C programming IRC Channel and you say
hey can I ask a question here and you say
something like that the fucking rip you a
new one is it a good thing that they do that
no but that's the reality of the situation
so it's like being in the military right it
really is and and it was like two people

1040
03:29:50,378 --> 03:30:40,876
the military had a guy it was my senior
manager he tweeted we call him Sarge it was
a kind of sweetest guys you never know his
mouth on that guy he would yell at us and
you would say shit that wasn't me he was he
was honest I'm not saying it was good I must
say it was uplifting but that was it that
was the nature of the Beast and in you had
to get used to it and I have met very
significant philosophical odds with a lot of
other streamers over this particular
specific point they say don't follow mentor
to teach you to be an asshole and I'm like
I'm not teaching you to be an asshole I'm
teaching you to do your own research I'm
pushing back when you say you know what time
is it or things like that and you know and
I'm going to give a shit about it and I'm
going to it when you choose to repeat some
people show out there about how awesome and
such is then I'm going to ask I'm going to
challenge you to justify what you said just
like I would expect you to do for me

1041
03:30:40,878 --> 03:30:52,061
and sometimes sometimes I will jokingly call
people that eats in morons and stuff like
that which is something I'm trying not to do
anymore I don't actually mean you're a moron
usually it's a joke usually

1042
03:30:52,628 --> 03:31:16,654
it is kind of it is kind of tough love and
you know and I just let you know I'm doing a
little thing here because because the
consensus in software and Tech about me is
that I'm an evil demon it should be avoided
and and I you know I'm I resent that I
resent that I really do because it's like
I'm literally here to try to help you get
this job and no

1043
03:31:16,655 --> 03:31:44,236
are contacts this matter is it's the same
criticism of like when is 4 V who cut who
says people don't understand how that they
can feed themselves they should have been
retroactively aboard it and he said shit
like that in writing forever in these groups
know I don't think that's okay it was
hyperbole for sure he didn't really mean it
but even I think that the days of that kind
of hyperbole are gone but the point I'm
trying to make is that

1044
03:31:44,240 --> 03:31:54,395
you know when you say someone tell people
come to the city to come to you and they say
tell me what to do tell me where to go you
know why because they've been so bludgeoned
by the

1045
03:31:53,173 --> 03:32:32,626
by the system beginning with their parents
according to Paula ferry that they don't
dare to go experiment they're too afraid to
go experiment are too afraid to learn don't
be afraid to learn don't be get over that
shit that they want you to be in a state of
fear all the time the reason and if you're
going to if we're going to rise up against
the powers that control all this shit we got
a state return the first thing we got to
start with taking control of our own
learning and helping others and building a
community about labor union I'm talking
about a community that help each other out
it isn't fighting against the scarcity
mentality is like if you succeed i-60 and we
help each other

1046
03:32:32,630 --> 03:32:43,855
and it's not competitive it's not I'm better
than you I am the talking head who's better
than you I am the streamer who's better than
you bow down to me for I am the streamer you
know we don't want that shit

1047
03:32:43,866 --> 03:32:48,079
yeah there's enough for everybody so okay

1048
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:55,623
you know so then yeah I agree

1049
03:32:56,056 --> 03:33:07,489
enter Dennis the Dennis and I are like
lockstep on that kind of topic we told her
and then you get it running fuck you money
and then you do whatever right

1050
03:33:07,738 --> 03:33:11,289
yeah and tell me when I disagree all the
time

1051
03:33:11,368 --> 03:33:19,174
but it's a soft disagreement I mean
sometimes it depends I mean if you tell me
I'm a shit programmer I'm going to attack
you or time you out

1052
03:33:19,647 --> 03:33:26,540
because it's it might be true I didn't want
to hear it no

1053
03:33:28,564 --> 03:33:36,538
so you're wrong you suck what are you going
to tell me why I didn't know to beat me up
and not tell me why

1054
03:33:37,093 --> 03:33:39,590
that's a cool cell

1055
03:33:41,284 --> 03:33:54,050
and bad for her because I don't think I I
don't I typically don't say you're bad for
me I don't believe I've ever been attacked
for that I've said that certain code was
shit

1056
03:33:54,544 --> 03:34:00,580
and if somebody happened to it written that
you would then then yeah I guess it was
implied right

1057
03:34:00,848 --> 03:34:03,644
that is your programmer right absolutely

1058
03:34:04,192 --> 03:34:09,952
yeah I know that's that's a real that's it
that's a tiny that's a hard part I'm like oh
my God this code is so fucking ugly

1059
03:34:10,338 --> 03:34:14,663
and then you proceed to tell them why it's
ugly right

1060
03:34:14,664 --> 03:34:19,742
that's my best friend wishing you talking
about Google allow Google for exam

1061
03:34:19,928 --> 03:34:23,565
remember zacian doesn't help yeah

1062
03:34:23,599 --> 03:34:28,772
education is really behind oh my God yeah so
far behind Frank it really is

1063
03:34:29,023 --> 03:34:38,022
yeah yeah my car is terrible to look people
if people think they look if I look at your
phone I see this code is absolute shit

1064
03:34:38,807 --> 03:34:46,016
and I look at my own coding like oh my God
this code of shit I'm saying the code is
shit I'm not saying your shit

1065
03:34:48,876 --> 03:34:55,045
if you were look at my partitioning skills
right now they oh my God this guy's skills
are shit and Frank has said so

1066
03:34:55,637 --> 03:35:01,507
perform when it comes to cutting see oh my
God this Casey Cody Stills or shit they are
shit

1067
03:35:03,770 --> 03:35:10,043
you know it's a southern thing I think we
need to start owning our

1068
03:35:10,044 --> 03:35:25,814
are what I want to say here are our
weaknesses I think it's okay to be
vulnerable I think you should own your way
cuz it's hard it's hard man I've I'm fired
back pretty heavily on people when they
attacked me really hard it's easy to say
what I just said I don't do it

1069
03:35:25,816 --> 03:35:30,096
Arrow TV show will be worse than when I
rotation. Echo strand absolutely

1070
03:35:30,097 --> 03:35:49,552
yeah it's a real agree but just don't tell
me that you're going to put if you're going
to put like five likes and pipelines in
there well yeah why are you doing that it's
in the script you could have done it with a
brace mention oh

1071
03:35:49,554 --> 03:36:02,150
how do I get I want to hear you if it's what
you do you just copy and paste after we come
in like yeah yeah I can see how I probably
would have done that too that's the way to
go about it but I don't do that sometimes I
just jump right to this go to shit and I
don't do it

1072
03:36:02,151 --> 03:36:13,099
don't worry my first cousin did see we're
just all helping each other and we have to
be able to to own that right I think we want
to go to own that

1073
03:36:13,181 --> 03:36:31,025
not knowing not knowing you look self
assessing annoying what your weaknesses in
your strengths are it's like an essential
skill in anything in life if you cannot
self-assess rationally and sometimes that
means putting people in your space that are
going to give it to you straight

1074
03:36:31,025 --> 03:36:34,454
and you need to be able to take that if
you're not that person then you're just

1075
03:36:33,080 --> 03:37:03,107
that person and you're just a trump is a
person like Trump have with that you
surround yourself with people who just
validate what you think about yourself and
that is dangerous oh my God that's dangerous
you want to get people in your circle that
are going to challenge you and then
sometimes in in chest they're going to call
you a moron that's a moronic idea what you
said sale and then we proceeded to explain
why they said that and I got you a fact yeah

1076
03:37:04,389 --> 03:37:07,682
setting up to Dunning Kruger is in Boston
right

1077
03:37:08,399 --> 03:37:15,047
imposter syndrome it's like thinking you
don't know anything then you figure is not
knowing you don't know

1078
03:37:16,605 --> 03:37:22,832
yeah super dangerous to all right so so so
so yeah

1079
03:37:23,435 --> 03:37:30,165
cuz you got who you going to see me go all
going to go in a kid sheets to contact his
parents at 60

1080
03:37:30,776 --> 03:37:37,252
it depends on how you define cheating you
know

1081
03:37:37,565 --> 03:37:41,656
anyway LS be okay

1082
03:37:42,192 --> 03:37:47,039
let's put that let's put that partitioning
code finally into our scripture

1083
03:37:49,807 --> 03:37:53,136
we need to check out the hostname equals a
thing

1084
03:37:54,921 --> 03:37:57,950
If

1085
03:38:01,293 --> 03:38:03,163
ice name

1086
03:38:08,028 --> 03:38:10,991
then it go yes

1087
03:38:17,975 --> 03:38:27,602
did you do did you by the way I can write on
the command line and cut and paste it into
my code and I don't have to order thinking
it's like less cognitive overhead

1088
03:38:30,020 --> 03:38:35,894
that is why I'm a big bash man is only one
scripting language to know

1089
03:38:55,190 --> 03:39:02,204
all right so if it's control then let's do
as a politician Shelly

1090
03:39:07,394 --> 03:39:13,125
I'm going to do Sea-Doo

1091
03:39:13,265 --> 03:39:16,794
hearted dash s a c b

1092
03:39:17,523 --> 03:39:22,402
ever sent and we could have done ext3 or
finally like that

1093
03:39:27,591 --> 03:39:34,960
control yep I think we did it

1094
03:39:35,718 --> 03:39:41,927
having to make a mount point hey kingslayer
welcome thank you for the sub

1095
03:39:44,310 --> 03:39:48,977
when to do this make make 3 / s

1096
03:39:51,868 --> 03:39:55,624
and then we're going to make a file system
on there

1097
03:39:55,624 --> 03:40:04,651
let's do that make fsst 64's

1098
03:40:04,652 --> 03:40:09,490
SUV 1

1099
03:40:11,072 --> 03:40:14,827
done the dishes are done dude

1100
03:40:14,827 --> 03:40:29,664
so I'm copying out the commands of doing it
by hand and then I'm coming about it to my
provisioning script so that they get done
automatically when I anytime I bring up this
vagrant collection of the machines that's
what we're doing

1101
03:40:29,664 --> 03:40:44,543
and so now what now we've got that now we
need to melt the point so make directory / s
okay and then we need to mounted and we
probably need to add it to

1102
03:40:44,544 --> 03:40:46,345
FS tab

1103
03:40:46,345 --> 03:41:14,287
I don't know if we need to do because I'm
just going to be taking it down later if we
could probably just do the mountain by hand
what do you think should be added to the fs
tap it doesn't and that it doesn't have his
tablet at fault I don't think right it's
been a while since I've done Mount so I know
that we're just going to do the mountain
directly so let's just do Mount Deb STP 12s
and now a CD into /

1104
03:41:13,226 --> 03:41:15,354
CD into / s we have

1105
03:41:16,496 --> 03:41:44,653
I'm sitting in / s we should have a
lost-and-found is a dead giveaway and now we
have now it shows up as a partition / SSDI
up until that point it would not show up in
DF output because it do you have only shows
file system usage and if it's not a file
system doesn't show up I do I have to use
lsblk which shows you all the block devices
and now you see it's mounted and slashes so
that's that

1106
03:41:46,117 --> 03:42:08,506
I know we need to export if so I suggested
the local area network for NFS and this is
some stuff that I don't do I've never done
it until yesterday and they were actually
export in if I smell before I've used them
I've consumed them a lot but I haven't done
a lot of that I'm kind of want to set up a
sound of Mount also

1107
03:42:09,441 --> 03:42:11,128
that be cool

1108
03:42:11,344 --> 03:42:25,472
because I'm at summer song by uses smps or
something and that's that if you have a
Windows Network and you do a song about it
will show up on the network

1109
03:42:25,878 --> 03:42:33,892
something else are awesome yeah if you put a
salmon out in there like why aren't you VIP
did you get rotated out

1110
03:42:39,559 --> 03:42:40,791
uh oh

1111
03:42:46,784 --> 03:42:51,615
some of those are awesome because everything
can see it on your network

1112
03:42:51,990 --> 03:42:57,123
everything can see it on your network so
yeah

1113
03:42:57,765 --> 03:43:05,579
Master like openmediavault does it come with
it

1114
03:43:08,582 --> 03:43:14,635
I might can't give you a key did not know
this did not know this hi hun

1115
03:43:15,005 --> 03:43:21,286
sweetheart I need to see my fire it's been
on all night I know it's fun huh

1116
03:43:23,085 --> 03:43:30,848
alright so let's finish the setup as seen on
take a break and go do something else
although I said been very useful

1117
03:43:31,929 --> 03:43:38,662
did you want the shirt back today iron it
for you you can keep it it doesn't fit me

1118
03:43:38,776 --> 03:43:45,878
better on you anyway it looks better on you

1119
03:43:46,500 --> 03:43:50,368
my yeah it is

1120
03:43:51,637 --> 03:44:09,163
that's the only piece of yeah I think that's
the only piece of clothing that I have left
over from my previous Wedding Marriage thing
which was God damn 15 years ago

1121
03:44:11,869 --> 03:44:18,577
that sure is old that's like a
fifteen-year-old shirt the only other
clothes I know that come from that is my
boots

1122
03:44:18,578 --> 03:44:26,059
and my boots take back to my college days
how are you

1123
03:44:26,758 --> 03:44:29,053
you're doing good

1124
03:44:34,097 --> 03:44:40,422
finishing up here now let's get this and if
this thing cuz I want to take a break and go
hang out with my wife for a bit

1125
03:44:44,184 --> 03:44:47,161
I donate it

1126
03:44:48,859 --> 03:44:53,654
an OLED TV no it's just a basic TV

1127
03:44:53,656 --> 03:44:58,884
I just have like a like an old school in
0-60 in from the school

1128
03:45:08,055 --> 03:45:15,699
it's really big it's like my own a s m r

1129
03:45:15,701 --> 03:45:19,370
the guy I like I put my own ASMR on

1130
03:45:21,438 --> 03:45:26,960
it's a is Samaras what it is it's just as
soon as early as tomorrow right

1131
03:45:26,990 --> 03:45:31,207
yeah I really like it though it makes me
happy

1132
03:45:31,208 --> 03:45:35,171
makes me feel cozy like my little plushie
here

1133
03:45:38,997 --> 03:45:44,552
Sam overnight

1134
03:45:44,552 --> 03:45:49,664
and we burned in I don't think this gets
burned in

1135
03:45:49,664 --> 03:45:55,436
was it changes it up pretty pretty regularly
we hadn't had any I hadn't had any bird in
far as I know

1136
03:45:56,456 --> 03:46:04,014
yeah I know but I don't believe it is it's
it's old but it's not that mean it's like 9
years old I remember the old stuff though

1137
03:46:06,102 --> 03:46:09,558
I'm at the I think it's French for today I
don't know

1138
03:46:10,334 --> 03:46:20,588
I told let's do this with some let's go
ahead and do the export now which I don't
remember how to do so if I remember right we
had to install rpcbind

1139
03:46:20,922 --> 03:46:25,734
which I think is already here yet or if you
see mind and nfsu tales

1140
03:46:26,729 --> 03:46:34,757
obviously buying is installed with nfsu
tells if I remember right so we can do our
PC info and see what we have

1141
03:46:36,839 --> 03:46:38,425
there we go

1142
03:46:39,687 --> 03:46:45,495
Pepsi infograph NFS I mean we got no and Fs
right now so

1143
03:46:45,550 --> 03:46:49,336
we need to turn an FS on

1144
03:46:50,245 --> 03:46:57,451
and I believe it's an FS server and I think
that's what we missed last time

1145
03:46:58,566 --> 03:47:00,644
an FS server

1146
03:47:01,492 --> 03:47:12,495
so I try that sooner systemctl and able to
stretch now which is a starts which is an
able and a start at the same time

1147
03:47:13,880 --> 03:47:16,433
service all systems you stuff

1148
03:47:18,201 --> 03:47:27,573
and I think rmfs should be there in a few
yet so that means that are NFS is listening

1149
03:47:27,878 --> 03:47:35,378
and now we have to update our Etsy exports
file it to have stuff in it

1150
03:47:36,562 --> 03:47:44,157
wanted on control Ivy primitive fire fights

1151
03:47:47,387 --> 03:47:54,770
we talked about so we got the end of his
server yeah we need to export

1152
03:47:55,973 --> 03:48:03,787
exports this is something I find interesting

1153
03:48:06,937 --> 03:48:08,658
I talked about

1154
03:48:09,432 --> 03:48:15,551
so I didn't want to know what should I
should I export the volume or the file
system

1155
03:48:15,759 --> 03:48:19,037
it's supposed to storm right so

1156
03:48:19,288 --> 03:48:27,158
and we'll just put sink here cuz I don't
want to get into we don't read right NSYNC
is a bunch of other options you can put

1157
03:48:27,583 --> 03:48:35,492
and the star which took me like 40 minutes
to find means exported to every every system
on the network

1158
03:48:36,733 --> 03:48:39,886
which means it's kind of a public thing
right

1159
03:48:41,936 --> 03:48:49,746
but it's okay because it's in a private
communities close to her so she should be
controlled

1160
03:48:49,746 --> 03:49:07,560
and then I heard they were supposed to do X1
FS Dash are again to get it exported I don't
know if that does anything that we have to
access the client and and and see what we
can do their Associates put this and go to
the client

1161
03:49:10,536 --> 03:49:13,025
oh you think

1162
03:49:13,183 --> 03:49:18,646
are we talking about the server and I got ya
thank you everywhere

1163
03:49:18,954 --> 03:49:26,429
we do near busy mind everywhere though right
okay

1164
03:49:28,010 --> 03:49:30,875
this is how you have it set up on your
server

1165
03:49:30,876 --> 03:49:39,775
nice if you guys have some of you have
knowledge on this would be really helpful
for me I don't do it very much though
vagrant worker won

1166
03:49:39,775 --> 03:49:43,707
and we're going to check ossh

1167
03:49:43,707 --> 03:49:52,719
I'm going to go check over here and see
what's up right so we should be able to make
a directory

1168
03:49:53,270 --> 03:50:00,498
local folder star a signal read squash I
forgot about no root squash thank you for
that

1169
03:50:04,988 --> 03:50:08,682
you're next when I first asked me to
double-check

1170
03:50:09,971 --> 03:50:15,199
if you put it to do here

1171
03:50:21,536 --> 03:50:28,426
yeah read write

1172
03:50:36,332 --> 03:50:41,417
sync no root squash

1173
03:50:46,218 --> 03:50:49,524
your voice of the cidr I know you can but I
don't

1174
03:50:50,243 --> 03:50:55,626
I don't because I wanted to be everything
actually no I know the cidr now

1175
03:50:55,938 --> 03:51:03,454
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we know
this area right now because we recorded
thanks to b.g.

1176
03:51:03,735 --> 03:51:16,059
I forgot about that that's in our bigger
file now yeah so we are going to the eye
peas so we can actually put the 192 it said
you are in there

1177
03:51:16,881 --> 03:51:19,030
and call it a day

1178
03:51:19,717 --> 03:51:31,714
yes I'm glad I'm glad we're getting it later
because of this next step if I can get the
client setting up cuz we got to hard-coded
IP number which is normally wouldn't do you
have like a DNS probably for that but

1179
03:51:32,246 --> 03:51:33,742
but yeah

1180
03:51:45,361 --> 03:51:53,185
and then what. I can't use. Star

1181
03:51:53,647 --> 03:51:59,069
you can use that star I don't know if we try
that

1182
03:52:06,087 --> 03:52:09,555
it is 0 / 24

1183
03:52:11,782 --> 03:52:14,253
24 is a c i t r

1184
03:52:15,323 --> 03:52:20,112
Wait is riding that so I'll see that was
right at the right way

1185
03:52:21,695 --> 03:52:29,318
RN 22168 the 2.0 / 24 timing is everything
in the

1186
03:52:29,408 --> 03:52:34,186
everything in the end when I chill with you
say it. Tony that to network

1187
03:52:35,517 --> 03:52:44,509
it's 128 or sewing machines if we did I
think 16 it would be the two there'll be a
lot more machines

1188
03:52:54,915 --> 03:52:57,002
alright so

1189
03:53:03,429 --> 03:53:10,704
are we got and insulation absolutely yep

1190
03:53:11,295 --> 03:53:20,055
I would say is what you are. If you want to
learn his lesson although you could I mean
you can do it without aren't you could do it
you could do like a Gentoo as well

1191
03:53:20,597 --> 03:53:24,268
yeah if you want to suffer through the build
right

1192
03:53:27,243 --> 03:53:31,633
yes I'm trying to think if I would rather
you did me in for that

1193
03:53:31,634 --> 03:53:36,948
you can build like a assistant from Debian
from scratch as well right

1194
03:53:39,452 --> 03:53:43,401
Genji's for compiling if you want to get to
that point of it yeah

1195
03:53:43,402 --> 03:53:49,574
but I don't see what why not start with like
a really barebones Debian with no extra
stuff on it

1196
03:53:49,598 --> 03:53:56,146
yeah. Aren't you do you definitely read
about Administration yeah

1197
03:53:56,384 --> 03:54:03,354
so export FS svr

1198
03:54:03,584 --> 03:54:10,146
exporting 24 G / s

1199
03:54:11,306 --> 03:54:19,747
send a message to get to learn ya you know
what that's a good point I like Santa was
because it's your learning Enterprise skills

1200
03:54:27,256 --> 03:54:35,006
and it throws all the stuff in there that we
need to write sing to me the way I know tree

1201
03:54:36,177 --> 03:54:42,728
yes it does thank you very much yes

1202
03:54:44,322 --> 03:54:51,585
I feel like I need to write that one down I
knew it but is

1203
03:55:07,294 --> 03:55:14,719
I'm a big animal fan now after hearing
chunky has convinced me I used tires Alma is
is Alma

1204
03:55:15,507 --> 03:55:20,582
Steve Santos isn't dead it's a big myth
going to get Tony while riled up

1205
03:55:22,216 --> 03:55:25,535
it is kind of weird that they didn't show
that I thought they would

1206
03:55:28,688 --> 03:55:38,187
all right so now we need to mount that now
and we should be able to just mount it very
easily because it's so built in

1207
03:55:39,273 --> 03:55:43,193
right so we can say we should be able to
just mount

1208
03:55:46,445 --> 03:55:53,419
one night at sea 192.168

1209
03:55:54,306 --> 03:56:00,438
the 2.2 right

1210
03:56:05,308 --> 03:56:11,927
yep and then and then what am I going to do

1211
03:56:12,838 --> 03:56:17,470
colon slash ass en / us

1212
03:56:21,100 --> 03:56:28,820
then hit right I should probably put it as
being there I bet it's a firewall

1213
03:56:29,877 --> 03:56:34,444
I bet it's a firewall Astros last time

1214
03:56:36,128 --> 03:56:38,397
you're at the house what the fuck

1215
03:56:42,049 --> 03:56:49,770
that does not Inspire confidence it ain't
even wrong

1216
03:56:52,179 --> 03:56:53,654
shit

1217
03:56:58,391 --> 03:57:05,073
I mean no route to host client address.
Three

1218
03:57:09,706 --> 03:57:12,620
you told me to private network instead of
routing

1219
03:57:17,335 --> 03:57:23,919
I think it might be right look I thought it
was fine while the Nets and that is the kind
of thing I would have expected to be showing
up as a firewall

1220
03:57:23,921 --> 03:57:30,800
yeah I'm pretty sure primals on sitio status

1221
03:57:33,002 --> 03:57:39,406
and it's on at the firewall thing hey chunky

1222
03:57:42,472 --> 03:57:46,830
yeah I should have any of the false false
positive right

1223
03:57:48,464 --> 03:57:56,110
I want to say that that was yeah just keep
said that I understand

1224
03:57:56,872 --> 03:58:01,737
because it doesn't make any sense or wait
are we supposed to be rules

1225
03:58:07,635 --> 03:58:10,842
I think we're supposed to add that you
should be happy rules

1226
03:58:32,555 --> 03:58:41,300
o a r a i see what you're saying that's the
new thing you can tell me this week so
that's why I got used to it

1227
03:58:41,301 --> 03:58:46,408
I don't use it now it's now it's dead Jim
it's Emily dead Jim now

1228
03:58:47,038 --> 03:58:53,086
oh do I see resource busy and somebody in it

1229
03:58:58,593 --> 03:59:02,896
tree expert FS actually at use the old one
just fine

1230
03:59:02,896 --> 03:59:08,949
it's working now it was a firewall I'm going
back to the explicit when I like this one
better

1231
03:59:14,072 --> 03:59:21,960
this year did Xavier how's it going to miss
her extremely expert FS

1232
03:59:23,153 --> 03:59:29,862
the best Dash reload XSport at Fest Ashby

1233
03:59:30,248 --> 03:59:37,824
if it's ID option is zero isn't that nobody

1234
03:59:41,160 --> 03:59:49,003
you think I should be in the and exports why
should you die

1235
03:59:53,421 --> 03:59:58,270
no becauseno because I want to only slashes
is exported

1236
04:00:00,039 --> 04:00:07,907
yo are you telling me that so that would
that would export everything it's a new
thing and it's before I did not know that

1237
04:00:08,389 --> 04:00:12,900
was here we're trying to mount here

1238
04:00:14,143 --> 04:00:16,465
I'm getting device resource busy again

1239
04:00:17,173 --> 04:00:22,400
is it going to be based on I mean maybe
somebody's connected in there I don't know

1240
04:00:31,021 --> 04:00:32,708
unmount lazy

1241
04:00:41,044 --> 04:00:48,642
I mean why is it doing that oh no no no no
no no no I don't think any of us coming is
installed I don't think it is

1242
04:00:51,125 --> 04:00:56,357
no and if it is because nfsu2 else is on
both

1243
04:00:58,561 --> 04:01:03,605
yeah and if it still tells the number of

1244
04:01:03,796 --> 04:01:10,498
can I can you do this when you are PC info
and then pointed at this I think we can

1245
04:01:13,453 --> 04:01:16,642
I just want to check and make sure the nssf
is there

1246
04:01:17,841 --> 04:01:27,934
yeah it is I'll manifest up is there so
that's good we didn't get that before we did
not get that before try it whatever I say to
you you going to put that in the exporter in
the mount

1247
04:01:28,218 --> 04:01:35,053
so for the fsid in the mount or the export I
don't know

1248
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:45,753
any actual game you guys are great

1249
04:01:47,332 --> 04:01:52,765
Mount Si oh my God it's already mounted

1250
04:01:53,618 --> 04:01:58,530
turkey mounted you already did it better
than automatically

1251
04:01:58,530 --> 04:02:04,802
holy shit in Mount it automatically when I
change it do you have to run mount

1252
04:02:05,540 --> 04:02:10,617
Ho Lee fuk it's working

1253
04:02:14,439 --> 04:02:22,025
I don't I don't understand why I started
working I dropped the firewall I just
started working with it because I already
put the mounts command in there

1254
04:02:22,025 --> 04:02:29,827
and it brought did added to the fs
interactionism out say whatever the nemesis
it's just a mountain

1255
04:02:30,500 --> 04:02:35,975
a backgrounds that it does OK that's exactly
what happened

1256
04:02:36,589 --> 04:02:43,183
yeah that's exactly what happened so that's
always busy it's already mounted

1257
04:02:43,184 --> 04:02:49,053
oh that's good news right so it says it
touch Foo

1258
04:02:49,510 --> 04:03:00,842
call Cesar Castillo Parts yes I yes I'm
learning that oh my God there we go there
was a small tear from the background

1259
04:03:00,843 --> 04:03:07,910
is there as wondering watch LS right

1260
04:03:09,124 --> 04:03:16,031
Touch another so it's making

1261
04:03:16,032 --> 04:03:34,715
it's making files across the system so over
here or on control and over here around
worker and it looks like we have the same
disk on both systems that's and if it's
working at tennis before only only on to
4019 CB that's what I thought it was
supposed to be

1262
04:03:34,716 --> 04:03:41,251
I don't know I just installed what they had
and it went over the bay so I don't even
know if this is right before I do I don't
even know how I know that

1263
04:03:41,752 --> 04:03:44,962
it does use our words

1264
04:03:44,962 --> 04:03:54,651
there is a version that uses 249 without rgc
there is definitely one because I read about
it because it says it's better to get
through firewalls

1265
04:03:54,653 --> 04:04:11,030
yeah I read something really briefly about
nfs3 all of this that said that there is
that the nfb for and if it's before is
better for firewall access because it's just
a single for a minute I think it's because
it's rose on her PC

1266
04:04:11,032 --> 04:04:33,941
and describing RPC to the average person is
beyond me irbc is a thing that makes up for
parts by providing more ports through and
another service and it's confusing as hell
it's a remedy from the old days I think it's
kind of dying out does anybody have any
reason to believe the RPC is actually being
chosen for new things I doubt very seriously

1267
04:04:33,224 --> 04:04:34,857
very seriously it is

1268
04:04:35,169 --> 04:04:45,300
I don't think it's going to be it's not
going anywhere because it's used for so many
things but applications didn't deploy a few
and far between

1269
04:04:45,735 --> 04:04:48,805
it's a saying Jeffy see the toy everything

1270
04:04:48,806 --> 04:05:01,486
I don't think jrpc uses our PC it's a
totally it's you just got the same name but
it's not the same at all the runaround for a
lot of things right there was xml-rpc for a
while and

1271
04:05:04,672 --> 04:05:06,183
and stuff

1272
04:05:10,920 --> 04:05:20,239
yeah I know that's why I'm saying so that's
why when you say the letters are PC they
mean different things to different people as
junkies telling you right now

1273
04:05:23,170 --> 04:05:24,551
and

1274
04:05:25,263 --> 04:06:05,578
that sounds like what I'm speaking about our
PC on the system it's it's a specific
implementation of an rpg-like thing that
distributes supports it handles that
limitation in port numbers for incoming
network connections and it's it's an extra
layer on top of the regular TCP IP port
thing and that's specifically what are PC
means when you're talking about it in this
case but it's gets use a lot to your PC has
nothing to do with the RPC that info stuff
that we were just using as a totally totally
different technology but shares the same
letters

1275
04:06:06,738 --> 04:06:08,196
so

1276
04:06:09,460 --> 04:06:17,752
and it's yeah I mean this is working so I
don't think we have to do now is figure out
a script that

1277
04:06:18,400 --> 04:06:21,379
bird of us exactly

1278
04:06:26,639 --> 04:06:34,243
of course I did all that is Route so let's
try it what happens I can I can I can I do
it without Root right I doubted

1279
04:06:35,067 --> 04:06:40,431
touch not route yeah I was afraid that

1280
04:06:42,493 --> 04:06:48,596
yeah I'm going to have to I'm going to have
to figure out how do you permissions and
stuff eventually

1281
04:06:49,598 --> 04:06:55,240
can we get something lost and found already
why do we have something most stuff out
already

1282
04:07:05,865 --> 04:07:11,270
it's not and you can turn on squash all

1283
04:07:13,100 --> 04:07:22,491
Cabarrus while we were good at it was either
Cabarrus or at some point we're going to do
identity management Rumpke absolutely yeah

1284
04:07:22,492 --> 04:07:53,828
I didn't even happen with the way it's this
way and is always goes and then if it's in
the book and everything I just I don't
necessarily want to get into identity stuff
now because I just want to set up an offense
without an identity stuff and that's one of
the biggest pain points are in a festive
getting all the identity shift to work so
right now I'm going to create processes that
fill the volume and do the testing all that
but I feel like we should at least make it
right it will buy anybody that has an ID on
the system

1285
04:07:55,551 --> 04:08:02,790
do you think we should just wash off and the
route I thought we did do squash all

1286
04:08:02,920 --> 04:08:06,701
I could have swore that we have a special on

1287
04:08:08,512 --> 04:08:15,076
oh I have no special yeah

1288
04:08:15,076 --> 04:08:20,656
yeah I think about making it here

1289
04:08:31,755 --> 04:08:38,694
yeah yeah I'm going to say

1290
04:08:38,694 --> 04:08:51,148
this one doesn't matter right this is a
review for me I don't remember remote
permissions that much I do know that you
guys can bathe at the biggest problem and
it's not a problem if you do if you know
what your ideas are

1291
04:08:57,652 --> 04:09:00,655
animator reacts part

1292
04:09:07,162 --> 04:09:13,104
that's not rude boo ya

1293
04:09:16,672 --> 04:09:19,949
well the other thing too is that these are
all

1294
04:09:20,626 --> 04:09:28,833
vagrant so the bigger user can share them
across all seasons

1295
04:09:28,895 --> 04:09:42,114
on the service of interesting yeah Lisa
Richards still yeah it'd be careful with
that to write because something that has 180
on one system I have a different idea in
another system

1296
04:09:42,837 --> 04:09:46,890
it's this or not contagious is different
base lamentation yes

1297
04:09:47,357 --> 04:09:56,543
Ivory rest is very different from what I
imagined you I'm not going to be looking for
gpsd anytime soon hey how's it going

1298
04:09:56,692 --> 04:09:59,698
I'm back b y u

1299
04:10:01,061 --> 04:10:04,954
b y u smile Mama do you know

1300
04:10:05,966 --> 04:10:12,453
yes sir I went to b y of the you you of the
b y

1301
04:10:14,792 --> 04:10:17,707
does it have any faster when you can have
the user to

1302
04:10:20,824 --> 04:10:24,749
I wonder if it comes with it by default I
don't know I don't think it does

1303
04:10:29,429 --> 04:10:36,279
yeah it's just it's just basically
information in this point this is final four
what I'm doing because everything just need
to be home by Meghan

1304
04:10:36,279 --> 04:10:43,969
so but however let's do this let's say SMUD
Simpson 7 / s

1305
04:10:45,148 --> 04:10:57,856
is it real that real you know truth is
serious can we got to do this if you if you
run an ex is there an export command that
does it and as it to the ATF

1306
04:10:58,378 --> 04:11:04,607
how do you do that is x 4 x 4 f s

1307
04:11:06,373 --> 04:11:13,712
I'mma ask for another one I'm an expert in
the MX sport you

1308
04:11:15,232 --> 04:11:16,752
and

1309
04:11:19,479 --> 04:11:26,917
smart 7077 webs slique

1310
04:11:28,820 --> 04:11:36,631
XSport slash you to everybody

1311
04:11:37,945 --> 04:11:42,871
God dammit I don't know how to do it

1312
04:11:43,319 --> 04:11:47,677
probably. I have no reason Xbox One command
line

1313
04:11:50,765 --> 04:11:53,585
yeah I know but I want to go to the Grand
line

1314
04:11:58,108 --> 04:12:05,880
containment are you fucking okay fine

1315
04:12:05,881 --> 04:12:08,577
you can do it that way I read about it

1316
04:12:08,577 --> 04:12:21,557
I read about it but I don't know if it has a
sexy exports I think we should just write it
stx46 yeah I agree I agree I agree I concur
because then it's like written some place
right

1317
04:12:21,559 --> 04:12:26,818
so it was due that looks right

1318
04:12:34,590 --> 04:12:36,855
2

1319
04:12:40,112 --> 04:12:47,966
Etsy exports oh God yes

1320
04:12:55,899 --> 04:13:19,233
I almost have this all entirely scripted but
she'll be so fucking awesome

1321
04:13:22,686 --> 04:13:27,072
do we only want to turn the firewall off on

1322
04:13:27,072 --> 04:13:34,296
the control box with Sam Smith I feel I feel
like we should poke holes but then I have to
do with our PC issue and all that

1323
04:13:34,297 --> 04:13:38,299
I I read I read documentation about how to
do that

1324
04:13:38,299 --> 04:13:45,773
about how to poke specific holes for it for
it you know I feel like that would be the
better thing to do but

1325
04:13:46,262 --> 04:13:52,063
I don't know yeah I want to hear

1326
04:14:10,898 --> 04:14:14,318
the prayers are working for me it is

1327
04:14:16,113 --> 04:14:20,449
for our PC it definitely is yeah

1328
04:14:22,188 --> 04:14:27,480
yeah efh I know if W I think it's a great
idea

1329
04:14:28,051 --> 04:14:35,461
I I like what you said there Ctrl firewall d

1330
04:14:37,641 --> 04:14:39,959
save all that starts now

1331
04:14:45,555 --> 04:14:52,716
all right I got that one off oh my God he
killed Lucy Lane

1332
04:14:53,123 --> 04:14:56,259
welcome welcome Raiders

1333
04:14:57,838 --> 04:15:05,820
we're planning to fails yeah I thought about
doing that as it going Christie welcome to
the party

1334
04:15:08,258 --> 04:15:13,664
yes we are having some fun here welcome to
the party

1335
04:15:15,972 --> 04:15:22,288
svr already there you think there is it's
good to see you

1336
04:15:30,270 --> 04:15:36,979
let's see here so we've got what do we got
here we've got

1337
04:15:37,841 --> 04:15:40,028
we're just wrapping up this

1338
04:15:40,286 --> 04:15:49,522
and Through the Looking-Glass all that's
fine you can I mean it's just you know it is
what it is thank you for the fall

1339
04:15:49,815 --> 04:16:11,337
we have successfully mounted NFS from inside
of a vagrant configuration of virtual
machines if that sounds like absolute Greek
to you you know stay tuned and what kind of
kind of talk. But it's extremely extremely
happy moments you just joined us for he was
going to talk about so

1340
04:16:11,356 --> 04:16:13,253
actually we have

1341
04:16:14,448 --> 04:16:51,398
I don't even need to be right now anymore so
on the system this is a Unix system right we
have a directory called / s which is mounted
to a SASE be volume created by vagrants
volume that has a single large partition on
it just for the sake of consistency even
though we could do it with just this TV and
we melted it's just us with open permissions
and add it to our exports file and that
means that it's now available to any machine
on the network

1342
04:16:51,904 --> 04:16:59,541
I'm fine welcome and permanent answer to
Samba it is that exist for an FS

1343
04:17:00,268 --> 04:17:06,371
see if you can find Hilltop if you can find
that for infested be interesting I'd like to
try that

1344
04:17:06,522 --> 04:17:14,858
so so what does that mean that means that I
can see the engine / s and I can say

1345
04:17:15,007 --> 04:17:57,677
bar I can make a file here and then over
this is on control its on one machine and
this is on another machine both of them are
virtual machines on the same person at work
and you can see that bar exists over here
right and we're actually lucky here because
vagrant is the same you ID on user ID on
both machines because he's were both set up
with Baker and so able to have a bigger user
which makes it extremely convenient if we
were doing this we have to get kind of more
nitpicky about you know users and identities
and stuff like that and what has access to
that file system makes every but for the
sake of our testing hermanita

1346
04:17:58,665 --> 04:18:05,908
it's reload should be the same friend FS I
mean I'm I'm game we can try it

1347
04:18:07,263 --> 04:18:15,034
squash all the you IDs we did squash squash
off actually

1348
04:18:15,758 --> 04:18:18,935
yeah we turn a boy

1349
04:18:24,756 --> 04:18:31,110
directions to wash off here yes you did turn
it off cuz of God

1350
04:18:31,110 --> 04:18:34,514
it replaces artist NFS I mean if that works

1351
04:18:32,952 --> 04:18:39,866
I mean if that works I'm all for that do we
even have that thing farewell dashcommand I
guess we do

1352
04:18:42,315 --> 04:18:49,311
I mean let's try it let's listen to this
fire back up again where's the firewall
disable that I did

1353
04:18:50,674 --> 04:18:56,421
I feel you in here firewalls in here
somewhere

1354
04:18:57,796 --> 04:19:03,716
status is inactive she's dead Jim she's dead
Jim

1355
04:19:06,305 --> 04:19:12,083
is it too long it's all Harry Potter

1356
04:19:23,739 --> 04:19:26,763
or at it alright so

1357
04:19:27,544 --> 04:19:32,549
is there just replace status very welcome
and

1358
04:19:32,942 --> 04:19:40,587
I'm going to say enable dash dash now and I
wonder if we lost her access should we go
check

1359
04:19:42,472 --> 04:19:44,672
straight jacket we lost her access

1360
04:19:45,226 --> 04:19:53,074
oh my God we did no more access for us very
well just blocked our access

1361
04:19:53,537 --> 04:19:59,605
and that's cool that it's that easy to turn
back on that's going my name

1362
04:20:03,210 --> 04:20:11,964
weather some way to check this there so you
can run to check it to check your FS Mound
so I can't remember it it's it's it's
exported something

1363
04:20:13,664 --> 04:20:33,246
I can read I can I rent I just volume out
actually this is actually really really bad
so we're going to do the command hear from
our suggestion kill tops suggestion to
firewall-cmd permanent

1364
04:20:33,681 --> 04:20:40,005
add service in FS Horry sheet

1365
04:20:40,670 --> 04:20:44,297
do you need to restart it

1366
04:20:45,209 --> 04:20:53,055
didn't seem happy maybe I need a r e x for
it don't trust even yourself

1367
04:20:53,250 --> 04:21:00,704
gifts extreme trust zero trust restart the
service the NFL service or the firewall

1368
04:21:02,840 --> 04:21:04,752
okie dokie

1369
04:21:07,599 --> 04:21:10,943
okie dokie

1370
04:21:14,632 --> 04:21:22,628
and I haven't it I reread the news yet
search are you going to go see Ken

1371
04:21:26,355 --> 04:21:33,359
I like starts but there is you know for
certain things and what that search for
certain things

1372
04:21:33,359 --> 04:21:40,497
remount Dash you think we're doing this you
though we're doing a different one it worked

1373
04:21:40,639 --> 04:21:45,651
what I do it worked

1374
04:21:46,673 --> 04:21:53,450
it works it took a while but it did it and
then we did it

1375
04:21:54,067 --> 04:22:01,039
just wait the solution to everything wait
just wait a second god dammit

1376
04:22:01,363 --> 04:22:08,472
yeah there is huzzah I feel so much less
dirty doing that

1377
04:22:08,472 --> 04:22:12,320
who said that Hilltop you get VIP

1378
04:22:13,104 --> 04:22:18,599
Hilltop gets VIP for being awesome today

1379
04:22:18,601 --> 04:22:23,807
thank you for that. That was awesome is
awesome to Justin

1380
04:22:23,807 --> 04:22:30,965
so I feel so much less dirty yes

1381
04:22:34,509 --> 04:22:41,105
don't restart the service just reload Mount
that show reload

1382
04:22:41,827 --> 04:22:49,909
let's make of Heroes do so we need to
disable the service we can do this right now

1383
04:22:50,974 --> 04:22:52,961
damn it

1384
04:22:57,701 --> 04:23:05,067
Sea-Doo god dammit

1385
04:23:05,068 --> 04:23:09,868
symptom what is it say

1386
04:23:17,009 --> 04:23:23,282
alright so some of that restarts on failure
after several seconds I think you're
probably right yeah

1387
04:23:27,271 --> 04:23:32,674
can we look at the rules iptables save what
is that about

1388
04:23:35,961 --> 04:23:37,087
yeah

1389
04:23:43,529 --> 04:23:47,527
sure everyone except for word except

1390
04:23:49,391 --> 04:23:52,208
wow I didn't even have any of his stuff in
it

1391
04:23:55,927 --> 04:23:59,759
what that is confusing as hell to me

1392
04:24:00,599 --> 04:24:07,194
track my command reload oh yeah

1393
04:24:07,654 --> 04:24:12,743
so it's arranged yeah

1394
04:24:13,930 --> 04:24:21,115
that seems like a speed rack really fucking
permissive I don't know man I

1395
04:24:21,524 --> 04:24:24,681
I don't understand why it's so permissive
that's weird

1396
04:24:34,917 --> 04:24:42,560
anyway anyway I mean it seems to be at least
looks nicer

1397
04:24:43,463 --> 04:24:48,487
I still think it's kind of opening up the
kingdom to the two package you know

1398
04:24:49,493 --> 04:24:58,004
because our PC or maybe it's aware of any
death benefits before and if it's before
it's supposed to be a lot easier

1399
04:24:59,489 --> 04:25:05,534
so 50 export Jason

1400
04:25:06,571 --> 04:25:14,493
do you really need a Nifty non-fungible
token export

1401
04:25:15,314 --> 04:25:21,303
God damn is actually named entity I'm kind
of afraid

1402
04:25:24,289 --> 04:25:32,569
AJ Styles versus longer supported use I
hadn't what's entity do today I learned a
few thing

1403
04:25:33,752 --> 04:25:35,394
god dammit

1404
04:25:41,523 --> 04:25:48,154
and if any tables and family pack of
Michigan phone number I did not know it said
it was a thing

1405
04:25:48,155 --> 04:25:51,574
and if tables are you kidding me

1406
04:25:51,907 --> 04:25:56,566
is that the same thing like a dnf Thing 2

1407
04:25:57,483 --> 04:26:02,069
oh my God oh my God oh my God SM filter

1408
04:26:03,927 --> 04:26:18,890
Pharaoh Diaz using nftables that explains it
right so iptables is not to think I am so
embarrassed to admit today is the first day
I even heard any tables is a fucking thing
and if you breed a sign of Teas

1409
04:26:20,494 --> 04:26:27,915
2008 I'm so far behind I am so far behind

1410
04:26:28,654 --> 04:26:35,847
I feel ancient I know I got to be tables I'm
pretty well now they got any of these

1411
04:26:39,087 --> 04:26:43,284
used in ft and

1412
04:26:43,284 --> 04:26:49,378
what is the other one NFL

1413
04:27:01,002 --> 04:27:06,949
went to check the firewall Dash C MD

1414
04:27:12,012 --> 04:27:17,824
yeah one of the ten thousand

1415
04:27:19,201 --> 04:27:21,801
oh my God

1416
04:27:24,028 --> 04:27:32,375
checking to see changes to the fire to the
IP tables

1417
04:27:34,042 --> 04:27:36,241
alphabet

1418
04:27:38,538 --> 04:27:54,247
only to realize there didn't seem to be
anything if it seemed pretty permissive
though specific to a n f s in their turns
out

1419
04:27:53,254 --> 04:28:01,153
it was changing working package filters
fluid

1420
04:28:01,279 --> 04:28:03,519
let's roll set is that what it is

1421
04:28:07,560 --> 04:28:14,913
the new was it called its called

1422
04:28:17,454 --> 04:28:24,906
damn the new tables

1423
04:28:28,045 --> 04:28:33,948
which can be checked with a Nifty

1424
04:28:36,750 --> 04:28:40,814
oral sex more or less

1425
04:28:42,415 --> 04:28:50,079
it's Hills Dash hell thanks 2

1426
04:28:53,154 --> 04:28:59,340
Teva cept and you can

1427
04:29:00,695 --> 04:29:06,456
and twitch community I'm pointing this out

1428
04:29:10,213 --> 04:29:19,144
have no basis for that other than to know I
might try it right now while I'm thinking of
it so and if T list rule set

1429
04:29:21,265 --> 04:29:27,521
oh unexpected new line

1430
04:29:32,370 --> 04:29:34,065
this seems odd

1431
04:29:40,695 --> 04:29:42,775
oh dear

1432
04:29:49,125 --> 04:29:54,340
have completion Dash h

1433
04:29:55,954 --> 04:29:57,212
oh

1434
04:30:05,112 --> 04:30:06,954
no dashes

1435
04:30:13,095 --> 04:30:20,879
I'm trying to figure this one out to to to
to do

1436
04:30:23,340 --> 04:30:30,813
I heard HP directory Fallon command

1437
04:30:41,228 --> 04:30:47,639
nft when would you export

1438
04:30:49,674 --> 04:30:56,403
how are we do XSport Astrid s j

1439
04:30:59,085 --> 04:31:04,744
XSport I got the aquarium is pretty fun huh

1440
04:31:04,922 --> 04:31:13,532
I I stopped doing that all day though
because people were annoyed by the
notifications so rip fishies

1441
04:31:20,361 --> 04:31:22,335
what's up with this

1442
04:31:25,782 --> 04:31:31,455
I feel like I'm broke it somehow what did I
break break

1443
04:31:34,844 --> 04:31:36,104
there we go

1444
04:31:40,547 --> 04:31:43,579
everytable filters

1445
04:31:45,394 --> 04:31:52,572
yeah that's why I'm just as well figure this
out so yeah I'll put a changed

1446
04:31:53,739 --> 04:32:01,724
they sell chainsaw huh I pictures of still
think I figured it would be asking the
colonel that's pretty deep in that colonel

1447
04:32:03,693 --> 04:32:08,400
I'm guessing all the stuff and turn away is
not the same as the tools are changing again

1448
04:32:09,042 --> 04:32:11,867
I don't know that but I'm guessing

1449
04:32:15,244 --> 04:32:22,764
oh my God thank you for the reference
holyshit

1450
04:32:25,717 --> 04:32:31,360
as fucking huge this fucking huge

1451
04:32:35,366 --> 04:32:38,784
I want to I want to properly to this so I'm
going to book Market

1452
04:32:43,459 --> 04:32:51,121
and filters iptables project homepage in a
tablespoon of jacked

1453
04:33:00,620 --> 04:33:02,174
I guess that's fine

1454
04:33:06,869 --> 04:33:20,592
nice that's nice to know I feel instructed
by God damn I have learned so much today
from y'all I have I have learned a ton a ton
of God it's all written down it's going to
help will stink in

1455
04:33:23,432 --> 04:33:30,599
even if importation of filter sales it's
freezing at Bridges woo

1456
04:33:31,522 --> 04:33:33,208
anacyclus website

1457
04:33:34,138 --> 04:33:41,978
what's that you know the surf browser I have
not heard about the surprise yet I think I
haven't heard about that now

1458
04:33:44,855 --> 04:33:54,114
not the way I thought they all my God me too
well I saw the infrastructure stuff right
but I'm going to repeat what I said earlier

1459
04:33:54,114 --> 04:33:57,416
the calendar is being

1460
04:33:57,774 --> 04:34:07,042
restricted I'm chopping back all the
material I'm going to try to cover in my
boots education stuff to

1461
04:34:08,002 --> 04:34:09,476
2

1462
04:34:10,593 --> 04:34:48,803
Lennox and coding specifically for Lennox
coding operation stuff infrastructure
Engineering in containers communities that's
all you're going to see me stream about in
an education capacity on Saturday so I'll do
a lot of other fun stuff but but that's the
only educational content are going to see
from me no more sea coding will will touch
on sealcoating during a structure
engineering wake up when we talked about
system calls and it's trace and stuff like
that going to cover pointers and a little
bit of sea and go in the coating part of the
universe but video where a lot of scripting
language structure engineering to

1463
04:34:51,494 --> 04:34:59,032
so there's the the Boost if you want to keep
track of it

1464
04:34:59,219 --> 04:35:02,020
and a few new people in here so

1465
04:35:02,577 --> 04:35:13,551
if you want it you want to keep track of
what's going on tomorrow is ama ama today
pretty much all day as well since we've been
going so I do want to spend some time with
my wife though

1466
04:35:13,591 --> 04:35:22,528
ansible absolutely ansible terraform vagrant
they're all going to be covered

1467
04:35:23,067 --> 04:35:39,304
get bigger and I know it's old but you know
it still has value virtualbox virtualbox
Liberty moo KVM all that stuff goes under
that probably proxmox or something like that
set up local cloud

1468
04:35:39,420 --> 04:35:53,374
is it affect the infrastructure engineering
could be mostly about virtualization almost
all because virtualization is the best way
to test network engineering and a lot of the
count so so so yeah

1469
04:35:54,070 --> 04:35:56,508
Zoom that back out

1470
04:35:56,566 --> 04:36:07,396
over to silvergate yes yes I kind of want to
look at that too because there's just so
much to cover their

1471
04:36:07,397 --> 04:36:12,967
you know I will command

1472
04:36:13,698 --> 04:36:17,824
that filter is used Bass for actual hooks
really

1473
04:36:17,824 --> 04:36:25,514
God damn it again so just I don't know
something just does a bunch of server use it
and using it filter

1474
04:36:25,515 --> 04:36:33,421
Curtis there is a red hat Enterprise thing I
think it's another situation situation we're
picking red-headed so is a wise choice for
Enterprise

1475
04:36:33,422 --> 04:36:41,115
they all do it doesn't make sense because we
were looking at iptables stuff on our honor
apt stuff

1476
04:36:41,115 --> 04:36:48,823
is it going to rain thing interesting I must
have had an older Colonel then

1477
04:36:50,023 --> 04:36:56,261
I can't remember where it was but I thought
we were using a table and some the other day
and I can't remember what it was

1478
04:36:56,263 --> 04:36:59,318
it was one of the containers that we were
doing

1479
04:37:01,897 --> 04:37:04,884
I appreciate your thinking

1480
04:37:05,102 --> 04:37:12,774
Abalone Farmall they're

1481
04:37:14,772 --> 04:37:24,941
apparently it's been around for a long time
okay I did not know I did not know this is
what happens when you get away from it
before to engineering is to become a coder

1482
04:37:25,781 --> 04:37:30,107
self now I know

1483
04:37:32,478 --> 04:37:39,125
Suddenlink I want to adhere y'all are giving
me Great Lakes I got to Adam

1484
04:37:40,541 --> 04:37:44,649
1998 fuck I don't believe you

1485
04:37:46,021 --> 04:37:53,029
I was done using it filter anyway I'll tell
you that I'll be able to start using a table
to like 2,000

1486
04:37:54,144 --> 04:37:59,768
oh my God I'm not listing Wikipedia yeah

1487
04:38:01,587 --> 04:38:11,154
right on that, I don't know but the
knowledge base is pretty good yet the Reddit
Engineers are good there's no doubt about
that the redhead company the engineer is
amazing

1488
04:38:13,764 --> 04:38:22,625
your buggy service don't have no filter or
see that's okay now I'm I feel Justified

1489
04:38:23,409 --> 04:38:31,191
I'd like to make a conclusion that yet
another reason to use that had for your
Enterprise simulations is 2 is that filter

1490
04:38:33,115 --> 04:38:43,904
I'm actually going to put that in my list of
notes I I didn't respond I didn't know about
red hat and why you should use it for
Enterprise simulation and that's one of them

1491
04:38:48,319 --> 04:38:49,837
so

1492
04:38:56,029 --> 04:38:57,490
yeah

1493
04:39:28,263 --> 04:39:31,587
you tell me what all goes in a filter even
though it's a shame

1494
04:39:32,516 --> 04:39:36,706
I've seen people saying that they needed to
look Beyond in filter

1495
04:39:37,266 --> 04:39:41,916
where where was that that's where I saw it
that's where I saw it

1496
04:39:42,217 --> 04:39:47,051
that was in the NFL supporting and said you
needed to be able to plug in for beer and
air filter

1497
04:39:49,384 --> 04:39:53,758
yeah BP folder

1498
04:40:12,147 --> 04:40:21,618
yes doctor sometimes when I should be there
in that folder that was what I saw yeah it's
Four Bridges yes if that's a specifically

1499
04:40:21,619 --> 04:40:25,225
that's miss it was a wizard Vigor an ansible
thing

1500
04:40:29,548 --> 04:40:37,446
now that there was there was definitely
something we were doing where we had to add
BR filter to a to a plug-in thing

1501
04:40:37,783 --> 04:40:42,959
I can't remember that was alright so

1502
04:40:45,417 --> 04:41:02,737
so we're about ready to test this thing and
it will be my final test for the day we're
going to actually run this entire
provisioning just by running vagrant up and
by the end of it we should have a working
NFS exported and mounted in the clients

1503
04:41:02,739 --> 04:41:06,853
and we need to do that so

1504
04:41:07,590 --> 04:41:15,815
so else if it's not a control then we should
be doing what we should be make sure / s

1505
04:41:16,194 --> 04:41:24,944
and we should dude be doing I think if we if
we if we call Mount should we call him out
or so we put in the office to have

1506
04:41:25,571 --> 04:41:31,938
call Matt alike hang around forever but it
should be the first one

1507
04:41:34,365 --> 04:41:38,366
mounts I'm going to do it I don't care

1508
04:41:38,974 --> 04:41:43,698
mount 192.168

1509
04:41:44,178 --> 04:41:47,621
Express SOS Mi yes thank you

1510
04:41:55,292 --> 04:42:01,247
navigate to Mount 118 at 168 dot 2

1511
04:42:02,075 --> 04:42:08,686
at 2 1 / s / s

1512
04:42:15,800 --> 04:42:16,971
yeah

1513
04:42:19,655 --> 04:42:31,603
internal with a V PS4 compiled in that
folder is also do it with me I'm pretty sure
it was a colonel modplug in the bridge was
the colonel not plugging that we had to add
for

1514
04:42:31,970 --> 04:42:52,412
something we were doing with a virtual
machine and live Birds it was part of
actually yes it was a part of liver thing
and we got around it and we just used the
docker we just use the doctor image for
Baker into that was what it was so if it
gets you just watching this for the first
time and you don't know nothing about
vagrant if you want to use liver with
vagrant just use the docker image

1515
04:42:52,414 --> 04:43:19,872
and run it because it has all of the crazy
ass live bird stuff including the bridge
netfilter stuff built-in we tried to do all
that stuff without it and it was a pain in
the ass and then I had to throw out the
doctor and I started going cuz I can I
change my provider for living for Baker and
back to virtualbox and I started to use
another Ruby file now direct and haven't had
any problems so far it's slower and slower
but because there were two boxes Luxor

1516
04:43:20,120 --> 04:43:25,492
if I think I'm provisioner is kind of ready

1517
04:43:27,214 --> 04:43:29,523
imma go ahead and close these

1518
04:43:29,971 --> 04:43:35,859
and I'm going to start this and if this
actually works we are golden for the evening

1519
04:43:40,042 --> 04:43:47,010
so I mean I get this is super exciting I
like that we can provision a kubernetes
cluster

1520
04:43:47,470 --> 04:44:35,181
I'm sorry A system that in the virtual
machines be able to run this vagrant file is
going to allow anybody with 8 quarters or
more and 60 MB of ram to instantly start
with the Baseline machines necessary to
install kubernetes from scratch on Prem and
to do that training her throw it away and do
it again and that is fucking crazy exciting
to me because this is the kind of thing you
need to practice all the time and super
excited about this start messing around abpf
I know it's funny you said that that was my
first concern is like user is allowed access
dppf

1521
04:44:37,613 --> 04:44:45,232
yeah yeah it's very interesting all right
let's do this let's go for this

1522
04:44:48,215 --> 04:44:54,214
dude I think I think we're good to go yeah

1523
04:44:56,168 --> 04:45:03,391
kind of a Bosch I just say I really love it
install nfsm client

1524
04:45:09,685 --> 04:45:15,815
and use a space you want to try it so we do
it it's going to take awhile

1525
04:45:15,817 --> 04:45:18,677
I was going to tell you if you take a while
to run

1526
04:45:25,406 --> 04:45:30,694
I got to destroy a destroy

1527
04:45:38,956 --> 04:45:41,608
God all the time

1528
04:45:41,608 --> 04:45:49,556
no I actually do want to do it right now if
I can get this to work I'm literally done
with this you realize what the next

1529
04:45:49,556 --> 04:45:51,696
thing is going to be

1530
04:45:51,777 --> 04:46:08,014
speedrunning installation of kubernetes as
fast as possible now that's now that's
something you'll see me Speed Run you'll
never see me speedrun veeam than tutor but I
tell you what I definitely will Speed Run
kubernetes installation from scratch

1531
04:46:10,420 --> 04:46:17,670
I'm going to do it I'm going to get it I'm
going to get so fast yeah

1532
04:46:17,670 --> 04:46:26,758
because yeah I'm not going to keep straight
at all that's what this is I'm not using you
because it keeps freezing Cloud thing

1533
04:46:26,805 --> 04:46:34,487
yeah it's been for the last week have you
really I know I want to be I want to get so
good to be able to get ready so that I can

1534
04:46:33,314 --> 04:46:53,362
Social Securities that I can do it we could
be DM on it on on a to note cluster I'm
sorry I had to work or you know single oak
cluster in like with a CLA and the network
provisioner and everything and podracing I
want to be able to do all that and just like
boom boom boom boom just be able to do that
and also everything and then it build
applications for it right

1535
04:46:53,570 --> 04:47:07,385
I just finished lunch and yeah if you I
still wanted to answer a phone do me wrong
but Victor is definitely to go to tool for
this thing even though I started out with a
love-hate relationship with it

1536
04:47:10,265 --> 04:47:16,418
I see it was a Tas what's a Taz animal that
is I don't know what that is

1537
04:47:16,644 --> 04:47:23,422
the second some information or anything
vagrant to assisted speedrun

1538
04:47:24,393 --> 04:47:27,972
okay is that a thing

1539
04:47:29,336 --> 04:47:42,970
so we have learned so much just by sitting
up this vagrant file I have learned so very
very much game consoles

1540
04:47:44,773 --> 04:47:50,946
it was how he was going to be around yeah we
need to get until 6 this morning

1541
04:47:51,140 --> 04:48:12,335
this weekend I mean the next step is to
write a shell script that that up to your
cooler that is closer like that I'm going to
do the upping of my kubernetes cluster I'm
trying to make a different Meghan file
that's why I separate out the slab by the
way so you know our Labs right this lab is
just setting up in a s that's all it is

1542
04:48:12,536 --> 04:48:25,082
and then I don't want to include that
material you know that education material in
the communities thing I'll say hey go look
up how to set up an FS right and then

1543
04:48:25,147 --> 04:48:37,967
CC I'm saying if you just want to set up an
FS you can go through this and then you can
go sit on top of my NFS and then we can
combine the labs and composing together
that's kind of like a, like the goal

1544
04:48:37,981 --> 04:48:39,529
yeah

1545
04:48:40,315 --> 04:48:49,361
I'm so excited about this so because this I
have been so stressed about how to how to
learn kubernetes without paying Cloud money
in there it is here it is right here

1546
04:48:49,508 --> 04:49:13,231
it is if you want to learn kubernetes and
you don't want to pay a fucking dime and you
want to actually use cover letters instead
of instead of Mini Cooper kind which
technically are kubernetes even though you
can't do things with them you can't test
city of your own storage provider you can't
test you know those things I mean you
probably can it was just you just be have to
really really do it weird

1547
04:49:13,234 --> 04:49:19,822
kubernetes uses you in Russia what's faster
Gen 2

1548
04:49:19,915 --> 04:49:25,859
oh my God emerge world

1549
04:49:26,779 --> 04:49:34,642
I don't know how long it's going to take who
is there anybody ratable up right now

1550
04:49:39,554 --> 04:49:42,336
do to do to do

1551
04:49:48,572 --> 04:49:55,050
what sometimes I wonder why I follow people

1552
04:49:55,629 --> 04:49:58,010
what if I fall

1553
04:50:04,269 --> 04:50:09,861
to to to to to to to do I'm just watching
this

1554
04:50:13,875 --> 04:50:15,962
what the hell

1555
04:50:19,796 --> 04:50:25,463
everybody wants to know what is you talkin
about I'm not saying

1556
04:50:32,511 --> 04:50:34,815
oh my God

1557
04:50:43,208 --> 04:50:51,045
I come on you know it I can't complain cuz
this is still much faster than it would ever
take me to do other stuff

1558
04:50:57,345 --> 04:51:01,188
how did they move their closed captioning

1559
04:51:03,962 --> 04:51:07,119
oh my God it's a plug-in

1560
04:51:11,685 --> 04:51:15,635
there's a there's a closed captioningclosed
captioning plug-in you can get

1561
04:51:17,532 --> 04:51:22,829
it's way way better than the built-in one
shit

1562
04:51:23,316 --> 04:51:26,430
did you guys see this is it closed
captioning plugin

1563
04:51:29,000 --> 04:51:31,945
this is why I watch other streamers I get
good ideas from

1564
04:51:37,335 --> 04:51:42,960
yeah there is totally a closed captioning
plug in

1565
04:51:43,781 --> 04:51:45,573
okay so cool

1566
04:51:48,296 --> 04:51:54,362
all right I just see it shows much more of
the stuff on the screen and it also allows
you to move it around and change your font

1567
04:51:58,401 --> 04:52:03,839
this one says it's called stream closed
caption ER

1568
04:52:05,005 --> 04:52:12,567
stream closed captioner I didn't know that
was a thing I just used to play no closed
caption button from twitch.

1569
04:52:12,698 --> 04:52:16,916
But I think I want to go add that

1570
04:52:18,054 --> 04:52:23,300
it doesn't like standard though but it's
definitely prettier on the screen

1571
04:52:24,361 --> 04:52:27,423
I'm sure I know there's a lot of different
ones to but

1572
04:52:29,553 --> 04:52:37,802
it's so much better because it looks like 20
lines on the screen so you can write a font
really small

1573
04:52:38,389 --> 04:52:41,198
yeah just kidding sizing on right now

1574
04:52:41,521 --> 04:52:48,137
so and I'll show you this or waiting for
this run first contestant on Chicot and that
cool

1575
04:52:50,254 --> 04:52:57,921
I'm really jealous for kittens of your CC
and BCC plug-in cell

1576
04:52:57,958 --> 04:53:06,261
ain't nothing I don't know about this I was
it drops the standard CC down here you just
have this only right I wonder if you cannot
do both of them

1577
04:53:09,391 --> 04:53:15,276
you know so

1578
04:53:16,785 --> 04:53:18,330
a girl

1579
04:53:26,421 --> 04:53:30,003
she must have box always seems to pick his
favorite

1580
04:53:32,751 --> 04:53:34,635
Debby Ryan

1581
04:53:39,108 --> 04:53:42,107
I can get about working good

1582
04:53:44,504 --> 04:53:52,978
somebody to look at font awesome because I
thought about putting I love font awesome
God damn that brings back memories

1583
04:53:52,979 --> 04:53:58,840
I have a celebrity phone oh I want to make
sure it works and I'll push it

1584
04:53:59,289 --> 04:54:05,034
then I will push it how to make a drum roll

1585
04:54:13,776 --> 04:54:21,794
I have to make I have to do things besides
communities like Adam Oates to my stream I
don't have the most on my stream yet

1586
04:54:21,796 --> 04:54:24,098
I really want to add him

1587
04:54:24,328 --> 04:54:30,174
it's like one of those like crazy things
I'll do when I'm like drinking or something
instead of play DotA

1588
04:54:30,980 --> 04:54:34,737
I haven't heard back from banana soap banana

1589
04:54:34,738 --> 04:54:41,672
went to Disney and they said they said that
she send me theirs had a message anywhere
just scored

1590
04:54:41,977 --> 04:54:50,836
I thought because I have caption right now
but it's like the old school one in most you
can get is like four lines I love that you
can like set your van sir

1591
04:54:51,130 --> 04:54:57,451
attention Scott description no it is not
which is why it hasn't happened

1592
04:54:57,928 --> 04:55:16,616
I know I like the most boring story ever I
however CC matters CC matters because people
can put me on at work and they can watch the
screen and do what the fuck is you doing and
they can chime in when they when they have
something interesting to see

1593
04:55:16,617 --> 04:55:28,587
yeah I mean and that's how I watch other
people I always have a streamer O2 on I
always really have like one or two streamers
on and in another in another window then I'm
just watching to see what they're doing

1594
04:55:30,540 --> 04:55:36,626
yeah inside the baker file I did not know
that

1595
04:55:37,066 --> 04:55:39,964
how did you do that

1596
04:55:40,148 --> 04:55:54,514
recommendations on streamers in my list you
know most of the strippers and recommend
don't seem very much had Tanis is probably
my the closest to me whenever head is on if
I'm not screwing me and watching me that
tennis

1597
04:55:53,421 --> 04:56:02,826
h e t underscore t a n is he does he does
Enterprise stuff he's certified in multiple
platforms and

1598
04:56:07,894 --> 04:56:09,841
what flushed face

1599
04:56:18,347 --> 04:56:24,264
holy shit why am I not doing that why am I
doing that

1600
04:56:25,206 --> 04:56:31,554
I'm at the game I knew at that right now I
have to add that

1601
04:56:32,459 --> 04:56:39,928
complete all right so we test it and then
fix it or should I fix it first all right
I'm going to add this

1602
04:56:40,953 --> 04:56:46,882
how do I how do I do I do it I don't know
how to do environment variables in Ruby I'm
sorry

1603
04:56:48,677 --> 04:56:53,534
EnV vagrant

1604
04:56:56,576 --> 04:56:59,381
energy grab bag

1605
04:57:08,679 --> 04:57:16,435
okay so I can we change these Envy

1606
04:57:18,566 --> 04:57:20,284
is it safe yet

1607
04:57:28,179 --> 04:57:29,655
is that right

1608
04:57:35,480 --> 04:57:43,063
experimental I don't know why I didn't know
that

1609
04:57:49,092 --> 04:57:57,063
it doesn't look happy that's very Pearl like

1610
04:57:57,692 --> 04:58:03,527
I feel like we have to change that now make
it right

1611
04:58:12,468 --> 04:58:30,763
what's the NFL some bigger machines about
your going to see it's for its for testing
setting up of NFS and for practicing
communities deployment to the storage class
that uses going too fast so I can fill up
fill it up and watch it blow up and then try
to prevent that that's why

1612
04:58:30,838 --> 04:58:36,981
so I thought you would never do it in real
life at me for anything practical but it's
great for development

1613
04:58:39,050 --> 04:58:49,336
midna specifically we had Domino's in case
you don't know Domino's a coordinated
application right and get ready we have
Domino blow up because the volume dinner
lying NFS volume filled

1614
04:58:49,667 --> 04:59:15,179
from a bunch of backups are doing it filled
and it killed Domino and this whole this
whole thing came about from my work
requirement to figure out a way to be warned
when I specifically a PVC is running out of
space and then I won't get into the details
about her that isn't Cooper news because
there's no concept of Field disc and
kubernetes at all

1615
04:59:15,430 --> 04:59:17,247
so

1616
04:59:17,662 --> 05:00:17,821
and it can become sort of a storage is
supposed to be infinite to not supposed to
care about how close you are to getting full
and that's that's not a kubernetes concerned
that's assistance concerning and so I've
been exploring different ways of of of being
worn specifically was sending a single
messages and so this particular project is
setting up all the stuff for an internal
companies cluster with a tiny NES will tend
to get megabytes on it that I can fill in a
controlled environment wouldn't even do that
in staging you know that would not be
something I want even to say to you so and
it and then I want to send a message on
possibly created a internal Cron job or an
external Cron job that monitors those
Dismount points in NFS just using it to you
or do you have for something and then and
then giving us a kind of threshold warning
in a single so that that all of that shit is
really hard to test and even a development
to raise environment

1617
05:00:17,827 --> 05:00:25,894
because I can't mess around with store
classes and make new ones and stuff like
that and I can't you know so that's where
this all comes from

1618
05:00:27,830 --> 05:00:34,315
if your if you want to create a allow that
you can read to a really quickly and early
fuck around with then this is the way to go
it really is

1619
05:00:33,245 --> 05:00:36,241
it go I really is

1620
05:00:36,970 --> 05:00:48,731
I'm about to prove it so vagrants God I hope
this works please let this work I didn't see
any like outstanding the error messages so I
think we're good

1621
05:00:49,101 --> 05:00:52,638
maybe get rid of that one annoying warning
to LPG

1622
05:00:52,882 --> 05:00:58,098
was that one in Orem and worry and kept
hitting me with I think it's gone night to
now

1623
05:00:59,530 --> 05:01:05,433
yeah it's a sage worker

1624
05:01:06,315 --> 05:01:13,313
if it's works we should be able to see Dean
2 / s touch Foo

1625
05:01:13,943 --> 05:01:20,934
and then they Grinch SSH into work or two

1626
05:01:21,755 --> 05:01:37,994
and seating is / s and it's there oh my God
we got it on the first shot if we tried it
on the first shot how rare is that how rare
is that oh my God who

1627
05:01:38,990 --> 05:01:43,415
hello there and this cat food

1628
05:01:44,227 --> 05:01:47,360
ekco fine

1629
05:01:47,875 --> 05:01:52,363
tifu cat food

1630
05:01:53,843 --> 05:02:27,123
makes me so happy you have no idea how happy
I am right now oh God damn it I know what
the tiny thing in the rest of your like oh
my God this guy but that is such a huge
thing to be able to do that to be able to
set up your own contained NFS multi-node
environment is just just just ripe with
possibilities I just have so many things I
want to do with this now so I am saving this
shit right now

1631
05:02:27,126 --> 05:02:40,324
yeah it doesn't happen if there's lots of
other things that didn't work on the first
try so we did all of these things we did all
these things I need to clean up the task in
here

1632
05:02:40,986 --> 05:02:43,618
I said for sure

1633
05:02:45,113 --> 05:02:52,121
/ asteroid rectory and Extras volume and
explored I didn't buy him it's a file system

1634
05:02:53,538 --> 05:02:55,172
that's it

1635
05:02:56,989 --> 05:03:02,948
we are done this project done I just need to
clean up the reading and stuff and we can
come back to this guy

1636
05:03:03,604 --> 05:03:06,400
Simmons find son work

1637
05:03:06,400 --> 05:03:30,260
and yeah I'm going to clean this up and
we'll put it into a better lab environment
but if if you want to retry this I encourage
you to try to do everything in the read me
on your own without help and then if you
want to look through to see the answer you
can you can come in and do the actually want
to move this over

1638
05:03:32,208 --> 05:03:41,002
move solution until our work and have an
issue I want to add there

1639
05:03:41,003 --> 05:03:48,779
I don't know right man didn't clean up the
read me remove related

1640
05:03:51,980 --> 05:04:07,548
that lady stuff into the work notes
readme.md instead so as to not give up
solution and clutter

1641
05:04:08,568 --> 05:04:23,522
misread me. You're probably going to be
around later but if you are I have the rest
of the night I want to talk about the
knowledge exchange red and I want to talk
about how to set up these Labs because I'm
making so many of them though I kind of want
to standardize on it

1642
05:04:23,938 --> 05:04:26,539
some of that issue

1643
05:04:29,367 --> 05:04:35,741
status statues holyshit this is not a game

1644
05:04:35,800 --> 05:04:41,860
commit complete

1645
05:04:43,029 --> 05:04:50,403
working solution needs move to work

1646
05:04:51,874 --> 05:05:10,654
alright so

1647
05:05:13,967 --> 05:05:15,297
I wantwait what

1648
