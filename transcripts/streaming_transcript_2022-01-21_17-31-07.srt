my stepson keeps telling me all the time the
Arcana

151
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:50,739
it's so much better I guess I should believe

152
00:27:50,972 --> 00:28:21,241

better than that is Chris all right I'm
going to have Scotty and Chris

170
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:55,941
I am

171
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:06,808
this is why you play Turbo if youplay Turbo
if you build a crystal like this in regular
Mr do that you're a bad person

172
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:17,343
where is never

173
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:29,953
I promise I don't have an escape that's kind
of dangerous

174
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:40,956
yeah I really don't have an escape I don't
have an escape so I got to be careful

175
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:48,030
and I have no way to get away except for my
teleport oh shit

176
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:53,784
somebody getting really messed up Sardar
that seems kind of dangerous

177
00:31:58,815 --> 00:32:05,409
I'm going to make it even there guess not

178
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,518
00

179
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:23,705
really going to hit me at the Double Alt

180
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:29,800
God damn I was stood three of your ships
almost

181
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:39,563
what's a loan and you came up with him until
I take out a sniper but he's on our side
he's just an idiot

182
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:51,889
hey hey Scott 14 kills and five deaths and
he still wants all the items I don't give me
this give me them lines breaker I must have
everything I want all the power

183
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:57,840
yeah we can still easily lose this

184
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:17,970
it's not all that turned onto It Ain't Over
Til It's Over man it is not over until it's
over how is this queen of pain not playing

like so she might still have them are must
be like really really bad

185
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:22,112
yeah so

186
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:36,338
this is why we play this game last night we
made a story about 40 minutes and I got I
kicked ass cuz I would just stay back here
and just kept holding everybody

187

yeah it did feel the scales finally finally
otherwise they would have if he if he had
stayed we probably they probably would have
had a better chance they could have one that
easily

278
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:36,220
yeah they didn't want it but they didn't

279
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:44,194
look at that chiseled Jaw look at that
chiseled Jaw

280
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:49,120
we are just too pretty to die

281
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:58,766
able to go we're just too pretty to die

282
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:05,588
oh no I hope my career didn't crash ssss app

283
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:12,245
look at that are slow so glad we have that
sniper oh my God we've been so much of
trouble

284
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:25,234
to do that wasn't him super impressive game

285
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:32,668
but it was okay the typical snapper turtle
game typical snapper turtle game

286
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:35,524
I know

287
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,916
I bet I know I'm saying

288
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:49,905
and snipers are always allowed their snipers
in your Ricky

289
00:48:50,182 --> 00:48:55,416
if I can win the battle of the law so where
the hell yeah we did not deserve that win at
all

290
00:48:55,416 --> 00:49:06,125
we should have totally lost that they made
so many stupid or strategic decisions like
really stupid decisions and those decisions
were led by the sniper by the way

291
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:13,168
let's Force blind in their jungle and then
have a team fight over there I'm sure that's
a great idea

292
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:24,296
yeah unfortunately I'm stuck in this lovely
why do you think I love nature problem so
much because nature profit can play a
strategic game no matter what the fuck the
team does

293
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:27,237
you start playing dated a few days ago

294
00:49:27,237 --> 00:49:41,995
snipers broken turbo for sure yeah there's a
few characters that are really broken and
turbo snipers broken turbo and teenagers is
broken and turbo and as if you here as if
you're playing Turbo you just do it because
it's funnier Ultra cool if you can pull it
off and

295
00:49:41,694 --> 00:49:48,295
and that would include coddle I've seen
cuddles like carry Turbo Games before

296
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:59,551
turbo is a different game Turbo is not do do
they got you fooled all the characters of
the same and all the maps the same but it's
not the same game

297
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:12,288
Turbo DOTA is not DOTA that's why they know

298
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:19,876
Oster Crystal again I miss you I miss you

don't really give a shit about things like
having a good game because it's a good game
and they actually have skill it's because I
just want to win they don't care they just
like they're so young they don't care I just
want to win all that matters is if they win
it's it's

301

450
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:16,302
sf9 Jungle is a turbo we don't jungle

451
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:23,327
turbo doesn't jungle you do turbo and you do
jungle in the turbo but it's not nearly the
same

452
01:16:23,426 --> 01:16:27,573
that's all I want to say about that yeah

453
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:33,198
9 creeps are like at least as good

454
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:36,942
it's a totally different meta that's why
it's so different

455
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:53,389

01:18:41,126 --> 01:18:53,177
you think if you do this you got to make
sure you got to make sure you control your
your creeps you do not want to hand over
your creeps XP to them if they get low

461
01:18:54,507 --> 01:18:57,201
it's like really important you don't do that

01:23:04,014 --> 01:23:08,904

is a play in the whole game and my opinion

478
01:23:20,407 --> 01:23:21,682

quite do that one but then you just roll
them all game is cuz like I can

551
01:40:38,857 --> 01:40:48,697
I just like knock the wave out and it's move
around so fast they can't touch you is
seriously can't touch you they have no idea
where you are

552
01:40:51,515 --> 01:40:56,659
just in case they're in our jungle would you
be stupid

553
01:41:05,004 --> 01:41:10,124
and now and now the rest of us all we're
going to go get

554
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:18,525
now we're going to go get we're going to do
deep words now now we do do boards

555
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:23,871
and the game is like over

556
01:41:26,996 --> 01:41:33,426
now this is a name Amara this is Turbo and
it's and it's really lonely no more yeah

557
01:41:39,672 --> 01:41:41,151
I'm going to take off

558
01:41:49,377 --> 01:41:50,958
Dee Ford's

559
01:42:46,645 --> 01:42:50,807
God damn it I didn't get either kill that
sucks

560
01:42:54,936 --> 01:42:56,556
I think you guys are cool

561
01:42:57,202 --> 01:43:03,182
if I didn't and they are expecting me to
carry this cuz AA can't carry it from now on

562
01:43:15,868 --> 01:43:21,695
yeah we lost we would win if I hadn't died
over there and I had and I we would have won

563
01:43:22,454 --> 01:43:29,188
I'm pretty got a refund and get the food it
does not count

564
01:43:54,225 --> 01:43:55,627
nice

565
01:44:19,369 --> 01:44:22,352
oh man I totally arid on that

566
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:32,390
well that was stupid for thinking of it now
that was like a real fail I hit three
different keys that is wrong key every
single one every single he was wrong

567
01:44:34,021 --> 01:44:35,773
do you like this

568
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:46,833
I'm going to try to get all the tracks if
they do that too loose they will lose if
they do that

569
01:44:48,721 --> 01:44:50,848
I mean I still have it

570
01:44:52,060 --> 01:45:00,028
no idiots go get those racks and then get
the towers I don't know why people don't
know this I have one this so many times

571
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:05,240
all you need to do to start hitting the mid
Towers is take one set of tracks

572
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:09,709
people think they have to take all the
things before they can hit the ancient they
don't

573
01:45:15,822 --> 01:45:26,360
the best way to win this is it that people
don't know this you take one Tower to racks
and you go straight to the mid towers and
take that ancient you don't have to get the
other Towers

574
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:28,829
there's no requirement to do that

575
01:45:32,142 --> 01:45:35,181
hill hill hill when that

576
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:51,987
did you get that kill you piece of shit all
right fine I save your ass when you get the
kill

577

getting really close though

578
01:46:29,106 --> 01:46:33,480
