1
00:00:02,526 --> 00:00:08,837
so good morning twitch and YouTube everybody

2
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:15,074
you change my notification hope I did it
fast enough

3
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:25,573
as long as I forget you have to change the
notification every time on Twitch account
how to make that cuz there's no thing to do
it drives me crazy

4
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:39,469
all right so what are we to do today today
I'm not going to rest until I have a Furrow
full virtual machine

5
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:44,130
hey that will

6
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:54,100
be created automatically from one command
using ansible so what is ansible

7
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:59,239
that's why I actually has an older
definition

8
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:04,479
so let's go let's go take a look at that
shall we

9
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:10,293
see here

10
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:24,264
let's see here what is ansible so he does
not know what a symbol is what

11
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,373
ansible is

12
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:37,309
this is a category of fictional devices and
Technology capable of near-instantaneous and
faster-than-light communication

13
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:47,274
that's actually not what it is it's the
second one it's an open source it automation
tool

14
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:54,166
that automates provisioning

15
00:01:54,642 --> 00:02:00,724
I can figure a she management application
appointment orchestration and many other
Emanuel it processes

16
00:02:01,408 --> 00:03:01,482
I like we're supposed to match between the
ansible users like system administrators can
use ansible automation to install software
on automatically configure everything so
answer will start a project then I got
consumed by Red Hat was doesn't make me
happy I'm not a redhead fan but it's still a
thing and it's used everywhere it's by far
the best type of tool for setting up
something and it's pretty clear I have never
used it but I've heard a lot about it a lot
of people that I really highly respect and
Industry that deal with virtual machines a
lot they swear my ansible some of them are
still forced to use things like chef and
puppet and you know even fabric back in the
day when the other is not as cool ways of
doing it and the number one reason an
ansible beats them all is because all it
needs is SSH access to the portal machine
I've heard people get ansible to make
virtual machines for them.

17
00:03:01,489 --> 00:04:01,636
It's not within ansible scope it's not
designed to do that that's that's probably
not its main purpose that's what people use
terraform for or vagrants earlier I mean I'm
not a big fan of me videos about that
ignorance disastrously I've dated in bed and
buy butt and I may end up using paper in it
anyway but but if I could just start up the
goal here is I'm going to go ahead and
rewrite this so we can put this in our read
me this is a learning lab or learning that
for me means not that you're going to learn
from me and he's ever going to learn
together I'm going to do some color knee and
I'm going to write the challenge for myself
and then I'm going to leave the challenge
after I get home and documented so that
anybody else can go through and do the same
steps to learn about it the way I did and
maybe they can you do collect these learning
labs and eventually we will publish all
these learning labs in some organized way of
some for a registry and that's why by the
way that's why it's my directory here is
named lab Dash because anytime I want to
listen to you

18
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:14,257
I get home repos I can look at all my
learning Labs just by you know just by
listening everything that begins with with
lab and at will

19
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:20,579
sld where am I am I in the wrong place

20
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:40,974
so it's there they all are and you know
that's just that's just that's just my way
of my way of my way of taking care of so
there's a vagrant one actually put a big
thing of the beginning don't use vagrant
sucks you might still like it I don't sew a
free country

21
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:41,823
Teresa Sarah

22
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:54,119
best ways to save her kids it's a free
country I'll do what I want so yeah where
are we so it's right down the steps again so
the first thing I want to do

23
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,171
is

24
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:11,109
create a virtual machine somehow so you know
I'm going to put

25
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:18,963
I'm preferably using chemo if you are on
Linux

26
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:25,124
is it really doesn't matter how you get it
really doesn't matter

27
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:52,658
how you get a virtual machine only that you
can connect to it directly with SSH so
that's the first step actually already done
that step but that's the first step then the
next step is figure out ansible right so we
need to install and setup and some oil

28
00:05:53,536 --> 00:06:00,437
which I've never done so we'll do that on
the local machine

29
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:07,184
and then we're going to be I think we're
going to be writing a recipe

30
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:18,295
wait we need to kind of like we need to kind
of like create a rough list

31
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:40,208
actually no let's just Dive Right In and
doing the recipes right so learn enough of
the ansible attack on the recipe I think it
is I don't even know I thought of something
I don't know anything and simple recipe I
just found a recipe that was chef chef was
hard as we think it's called My ansible
recipes I guess it is

32
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:46,971
it's like it somehow we and look how these
people have multiple recipes that called
mods

33
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,600
thank you for calling recipe so long because
of the old school right

34
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:07,146
oh my god do I have to do a yaml or can I do
yaml Media Center Michael notebook is going
to try to say so this is this is interesting

35
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,497
here's a person who saves their notebook
laptop

36
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:18,348
Play Books thank you thank you Cindy making
fun of me here

37
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,255
enough of the

38
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:27,223
all right enough syntax to create your first

39
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,890
ansible Playbook

40
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:43,059
I'm making these bold

41
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,433
I got that stew

42
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,908
some

43
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,121
I mean I kind of want to put here understand

44
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:15,506
why answer

45
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:22,636
answer the question why ansible

46
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:30,177
instead I'm just getting home

47
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:36,174
and she'll scrubs I think it's important I
tell everybody I already do that

48
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:48,245
it seems like as an as an operator
administrator a technologist kind of go
through stages right the first time you have
to make a new machine you like

49
00:08:48,246 --> 00:09:09,319
when you're when you're young you're like
building your own machines and you're not
running around doing all kinds of crazy
amazing things and and your head cut off you
really don't know what you're doing but
you're just experimenting your learning
you're loving it and it's been tastic and
you just exclude learn Lennox and then you
some point in their you have to get shit
done

50
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:22,004
and so you can't destroy hop every week you
can't like I just wanted to or you can if
you still want to just drop me like I want
to just go help and I want to be able to get
my stuff on there really faster if you're
tired of doing it maybe you write it down in
the notebook all the steps

51
00:09:20,851 --> 00:10:20,964
The Notebook all the steps that you did I
had actually used to do that I would write
it down in a book I did this verse in this
in this in this not everything could be
automated me some of us has to be done this
route so it has to be done you know
partitioning des and stuff like that you
can't you can't put that in the script you
can't you know that's a part of how the
system is set up and and it's hard to do
that stuff by the way you can you can maybe
write like redhead and 1 2 W both have ways
for you to to script the installer so you
can like hand off a script to the installer
and it would do all that stuff that that's
those are all solutions are really old and
your side the question but we'll hey I have
a multi-user system I just want to customize
my home directory I don't really care about
all this extra stuff on the DM and that used
to be true when you had a lot of multi was
our systems with these days he says nobody's
on a multi-user system everybody got their
own container or nobody would trust each
other on a multi-zone system very very very
rare I think even picoctf is change it's a
big to the Carnegie Mellon

52
00:10:20,971 --> 00:11:14,230
pentesting competition site and they said
32,000 users on that site is rude you could
try to get what I'm trying to say is that
there's a lot of creative ways for you to
like create or configuration really quickly
and God knows we tried them all along the
path is somewhere in there you will end up
making a. Files directory and I just call
mine. Right that's what I've been giving
everybody you know given to give her. So
this is my this is my. Files refill that's
got all of my scripts is got me on my how
you install stuff you know I made a read me
for it I chose to make my. Files very
unperson alized so that people can just use
it if they wanted to that's really dangerous
to do that you should really read anybody's
you know stuff and then make your own you if
we can make your own

53
00:11:14,235 --> 00:12:14,258
then I also have a repo is called private
which is on a USB stick that's attached and
that's got you know my passwords and tokens
and keep a sexy and all that stuff is on
there and I so I can bring up you I was
going to experiment with the DD script and I
blew my disco I like everybody has done at
least once and and and is a Sunday morning
and I was back up and running within 20 30
minutes I had to do was reinstall the
operating system and then installed get and
then I wanted to get into the gate pull and
I did our madman is telescript know to be
fair or set up a reminder set up script
right and this goes into all of his other
son directors run set up there and you know
it it is sells everything I have every time
I like it is it also kind of documents all
the stuff that I have on my sister so don't
file additionally I used to call this home
config because I didn't want him that I
change it to. Because the files is like the
common thing to consider 22

54
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:51,364
are you like that thank you Alfred people
people like using other people. Files has
been something we've been doing it since
we've been sharing. File since the dawn of
time you know if his before there was an
internet people would give you their of them
are see you there at back in his ex RC write
it actually see was how you define maybe
that's going back and you ain't nobody
starts with them with no extra could be
great we all do it we all step somebody
else's bash or see or you know somebody
else's functions or Scrubs N Stuff in and
being a Unix Linux person is essentially you
know means that you are

55
00:12:51,367 --> 00:13:20,591
and I'm doing a lot of that you know you're
you're you're you're borrowing from other
people and that's what's so great about
being open source so they can get annoying
so I actually have an install directory here
I don't run this stuff but if I need it I
come over here and I look and see will how
is that thing installed so terraform has a
very different now these are like standard
apt up cake right so time time didn't start
till the creation of the internet

56
00:13:20,594 --> 00:14:01,758
probably two and then this weekend I just
did this will be at scabs just plug it in
which actually fixes a bug that they Lennox
game people didn't know about it said oh it
just works I don't what's wrong with you and
like oh okay and I found out they were
totally wrong they had installed an old
version and I had to sell the new version
which didn't work that's all I wrote a
script to do it I need a video about that
you can go watch that video I put up with
that to you to email should be a vegetable
public today so this is I'm over viewing how
this stuff has been done to date but the
modern way to do this is to use ansible and
I don't know why I'm going to go into it but
I see you already saw people are using
ansible on the internet

57
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:25,663
go on the internet to create Playbook files
and I get it right that say Hey this is what
I'm going to do here is my notebook here's
my kids notebook and here's the media center
at so you can do all that configuration
which is so this was not just a setup script
it's everything it's like as I understand it
it it you know defines all of us if you
might want it also has a problem with it is

58
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:34,573
oh actually everything this will work
without having a virtual machine right so
you can do it

59
00:14:34,604 --> 00:15:05,893
on anything you can access with us to Sage
that include your local system so if you
want to do this for a brand new fresh just
wrote and don't want it to be a virtual
machine you can also do that so it basically
it's like that the idea that of a. File
setup script on steroids because it can do
things that you normally would probably not
prefer to do in in a script right and you
might put everything in here is my my twitch
setup everything is it's it's not you know
insecure

60
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:25,239
this is actually pretty good actually be
installed it's not it's not optional so I
saw that all the time I've done this so many
times is a much better way to do this now by
the way this is an old script but but she up
so that's I think that's enough

61
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:30,036
so I want to look at Michael's notebook

62
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:36,030
so let's look at this one I think Michael
notebook might be his kids notebook computer

63
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:43,083
delimit research if the music is too loud or
anyting

64
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,346
there should be a way to turn the music off
so that would be not too loud

65
00:15:50,865 --> 00:16:19,469
all right so so let's go let's go take a
look at this one I'm super excited about
this too because this is the kind of shit I
really love if anybody knows like when I'm
like him at any time that I have like free
time I'm at playing with your do that I am
messing with my config files or my life
scripts effort which because I enjoy it I
mean it and it's also educational so he'll
find me doing that a lot

66
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:27,169
so what does this have in it you know what I
think this this warrants just actually buy
it pulling down the whole thing

67
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,547
as well as bees I'm going to go map 7 you're
my new buddy

68
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:46,103
Map 7 I'm just going to pull up maps Evans
done we wrote this script the other day is a
great one to check us out clone repo it's
actually a function paste god dammit

69
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:50,732
always happens watch now what

70
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:59,614
clones it and puts me in the directory and
one command tell me you don't think that's
cool come on come on you do

71
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:14,627
navigate to change the state to CD into
another directory and stay there you have to
do it as a function you cannot do it as a
script prescription will refer back to the
state of their parent so let me show you
what I mean by that

72
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:40,503
I'm going to try that it's my day off so I'm
going to talk slowly in and I'm going to I'm
going to be long-winded here so here's
here's that that's super awesome little
function that's all you need now you do need
to install g h back to work and you do need
to have you might want to change it to be
however you do you do your stuff

73
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:51,946
so it also is is assuming it's from GitHub
you might want to try some different anyway
so

74
00:17:51,947 --> 00:18:04,811
here we are here we go. Let's go look at
these files I'm just excited and also do I
need to get okay it says it's the yellow
file so we don't need any special ansible
them plug-in

75
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:16,638
web server for running Ruby on Rails with no
stress and no. Run ansible Playbook web
server. Llamo

76
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:21,350
that's B becomes to do if you were both

77
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,491
you can fix it

78
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:32,161
area code or just change the thing that says
get up to get lab or sorcerer whatever you
use

79
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:41,229
MLK Jr for the way and yes you know God
bless MLK Jr the serial adulterer who
brought us them civil rights movement and in
a major way

80
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:44,370
major way so

81
00:18:45,428 --> 00:19:45,906
I always put all of our eye-cons are are
humans that's why I say that I don't say
that to disparage him at all actually makes
me respect him even more his wife knew all
the time what's the difference between a
volunteer form alright the short answer is
terraform is primarily for creating virtual
machines and setting them up with providers
there's thousands of providers that we were
going to go we're still going to consider
using terraform for this kind of thing but
ansible is for dealing with stuff that
already exists so configuring specifically
machines write it specifically ansible is
for configuration management and set up a
Beyond everything else that means it's
specialty is not creating course they can
apparently but it's not that special to you
was developed to keep configurations of
systems in sink and two just like if you
have a security if you have some

82
00:19:45,914 --> 00:20:24,717
you need to change your profile and you've
deployed a bunch of the server servers you
want them to all be no clones of each other
which is kind of the case in the end
communities right with no it's a lot of
times it's the same Hardware you want to be
the same as I want all of these things they
have the same Library you do you change your
playbook and you run it against all of them
an update tomorrow reboots and does
everything is needed so so that so care for
him is for provisioning machines I'm Taking
Liberties here as I understand I'm also a
noob so I get it wrong please let me know so
I form is for standing up stuff and ansible
is for configuring that stuff I get that

83
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:30,459
database oh yeah I supposed to trust that
you was my favorite

84
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:53,502
collect postcards my favorite name is is
yellow file is also just as good a lot of
times for dinner or Jason files I'm a big
fan of that made Fatboy files as a database
as an organization for database people is
indeed a huge database engine

85
00:20:54,462 --> 00:21:01,301
absolutely I would love to go and rest I
will then go to get a job I would learn R Us
to understand how your computer works

86
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:06,230
I think absolutely if that guy you're going
to hear me say it again

87
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:38,247
after I finish to see stuff if that going
through head for sea has made me want to
learn rust even more because now I can speak
very directly about how rust us up
differently than see so I think I personally
I think you should learn to see before rust
at least a minimal amount of seed might go
through the head for Seabrook I think
knowing that is really going to help you
appreciate the differences between rust and
see and be able to talk about them
articulately instead of just she playing the
stuff that everybody tells you

88
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:46,380
no rush espresso close Russ goes like this
assembly C

89
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:51,045
rust / C plus plus

90
00:21:51,046 --> 00:22:00,318
and then probably go on top of that if you
were going to in terms of like level of
language that's that's how I would call it

91
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,893
paramiko

92
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,736
it's hard to learn things with their
documentation amazing that's what I've heard

93
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:24,241
and I think I think ansible is is worth
learning I didn't used to think that I kind
of do now

94
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:31,097
oh my God he's installing on my zeeshan
emacs with a theme even

95
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:34,218
why would you do that

96
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:39,519
it looks like there's already recipes for it
someplace

97
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:45,400
gather facts testing

98
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,123
well it's pretty amazing

99
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:57,990
I got a lot to learn obviously

100
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:02,618
I get a sense I'm going to be able to steal
other people's recipe of playbooks

101
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:12,959
use a programming language that works so far
I like it as well but I haven't been here
very long time I've already been streaming
for

102
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:18,843
what 23 minutes I just barely got done
explaining the situation

103
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:23,041
irascible result if youif you serve me to
simplify Lottery work

104
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,101
don't basic stuff that's that's kind of
where I'm headed with this

105
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,672
and are we got cell

106
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:47,610
yeah, task system, task background while
Mill

107
00:23:52,583 --> 00:24:15,526
so it hasn't include thing it's it is it's a
language that only buddy freaking you know
to tell you differently learning and
learning as it was going to be learning a
language this is just a domain specific
language saying that they were generally
loses another language but has specific
syntax that's what this is is the animal
that has a specific context in which I can
before you go throwing her before more Helm
at it

108
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:22,717
that would be the exact opposite of what you
think I would use it for

109
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:32,361
but they didn't turn the server population
has red hat did all the things about big
companies like

110
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:40,729
please don't like that in you kidding me
bunch of angry Lenox boss people

111
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:46,569
nobody wants to put their their systems on
to that

112
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,210
I mean this this looks pretty reasonable

113
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:02,185
he has a a common thing let's go look a
common so common tasks

114
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:08,132
wow look at all this stuff I got all the
stuff

115
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:15,681
look at all this stuff God damn I'm going to
like this a lot I can already tell

116
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:22,846
you know what I'm going to do I'm thinking
I'm seriously the Caso spoiler alert I'm
seriously thinking about making ansible

117
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:28,913
setting of ansible and alternative for the
beginner boost to using a doctor workspace
container

118
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:48,766
so so when we do the Boost I want to give
people options and when they get when they
get Lennox I'm going to say look the
preferred way that I have for you to get
lennox's to install hyper-v hyper kid on a
Mac and run ansible on it run this
ansible-playbook the end

119
00:25:48,769 --> 00:26:14,099
that's that's probably going to be my
preferred way the only problem with that is
you can't you can't snap it back so I don't
know I don't know I think I might not I'm
still an opinion about it I'm trying to
decide whether we want to introduce ansible
during the beginner booster we want an
interest during the infrastructure
engineering boost and I feel like the
infrastructure engineering boost is going to
be the way to do it

120
00:26:14,121 --> 00:27:14,141
snap it back I want to I want to be able to
go back to a previous so when people are
really great thing about teaching learning
on it with the containers is that if you
screw something up you just create a new
container in your good to go he start doing
the steps in a container when you're a
beginner you actually want to repeat install
all the time you need to know all those
steps so that you understand what it takes
to get in the next machine running from the
command line and I think throwing an ansible
recipe with somebody unless they come into
the middle of the boots and they just want
to get things running and you know what to
do it that way so I will talk of that kind
of thing but yeah yeah I think I think
ansible does belonging and infrastructure
operations and I think because honestly at
the end of the terminal command line and how
to install software on Linux and that's a
hundred percent doable in dr. right so
install Docker desktop pull down a bunch of
image

121
00:27:14,147 --> 00:28:01,836
you know proceed contact so I'm going to
talk to you in a bit I was at for a second I
was thinking hate you know if you want to
get my exact workstation image here it is
and I think I probably will do that I've
been using I've been using it darker when I
call dr. workspace image a lot and I think
I'm going to actually change that because
here's why I believe it or not the stuff I'm
doing right now actually applies to my job
because I'm going to get it back in a little
while and because they're refreshing my
Windows machine with Mac instead because
it's just better for everything that I do
then I Windows machine and a piece or two
doesn't work with my doctor just stopped but
there's a chance there's a chance that by
doing this with the ansible I can actually
get if I if I do the VM install I can use
this to get any work

122
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:14,211
any work laptop up and running ready for
work as fast as possible and then I don't
have to sit around in like save me work time
right so so that's what I'm looking for

123
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:23,065
I can continue to it works out for Justin
but I wanted to stop by because I saw this
time I got to kick it oh God

124
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:28,777
character cutter everything your keyboard
can do and more

125
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:32,717
type faster than physically possible

126
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:39,141
what the hell is this

127
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,289
I just knows

128
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:57,317
I mean this is the kind of thing I would go
for it cuz it's a keyboard thing

129
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,325
oh God

130
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:12,993
I fucking hate weird he was like that they
don't do anything for your original mix

131
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:17,052
simultaneously will automatically range in

132
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:22,514
3d motion detection

133
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:32,241
we're going to see innovation in this area
because keyboards or imperfect what the hell

134
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:50,142
that's crazy that's crazy

135
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:55,185
that's crazy

136
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,593
I think I think something like that's going
to become popular I really do

137
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:29,902
the problem with it is is that you're a
hundred percent bound to it from then on but
being bound to a specific keyboard is kind
of a modern phenomenon even with covid-19
testing each other's keyboards anymore I
don't like you go to a lab and usually
everybody the same key work that's why I
think his there's never been a time in
history where using your own keyboard
configuration layout to where I can whatever
is is actually okay

138
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:32,682
a Tavor shell script

139
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:43,634
well because it's a standard way to
configure it it would work on a cloud
deployment as well you can point it anything
that has a cessation able to it

140
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:56,580
no I'm not allowed to use Linux at work nope
nope I actually joked about quitting over it
and because that is how she doesn't work and
they told me he's putty or and get used to
it in my bucket I'm not doing

141
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:16,995
the very very in that sense they're kind of
the kind of old school it's a conservative
organization that wants to mostly they don't
want to give up the ability to spy on you
and their spyware only works on the on the
windows and Linux I mean Windows and Mac

142
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:22,446
so I saw a Mexican cheese okay

143
00:31:23,118 --> 00:31:29,036
I'm going to get any laptop I haven't got it
yet they're going to give me a Mac

144
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:48,980
and most of that give me the nightmare says
more RAM I can't do my job on this they gave
me a really shity 15-inch still with a
broken like all the ports on the right side
of broken is refurbished at with 8 GB of RAM
to do a performance and they want me to
evaluate the applications of stuff

145
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:57,579
Spider-Man seems like we'll just do it from
the login server that doesn't even have
doctor on it and I'm like I can't do this
can't do this job with me. You've had sex

146
00:31:58,027 --> 00:32:01,497
I just think what is a FreeBSD desktop

147
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,051
yeah it kind of is This Will maxar

148
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:13,806
the things I want to do is that I want to do
headless I want to see if I forget a 17-0

149
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:37,216
if you're going to see that would be an
awesome day stuff at work for video editing
the laptop I can just do anything they say
it's all yours already want to thank God for
you I mean most most companies are like that
but my company isn't like that also my
company says you should be using a system
close to the ones for the customers that
we're supporting so that you can help them
if they have a question

150
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:41,199
ya self

151
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:58,197
just so happens that the higher percentage
of Machinery people in our organization all
use max because he can't use Windows because
W because Debbie cell does not work with our
BPNC crazy shit ever I swear

152
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:09,014
and they still understand why and I'm like
okay fine mean I don't I don't wanna
complain too much I just want to work so

153
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:12,500
say why I should use this over shell script

154
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:36,156
my shortest answer Tuesday and some of her
shell script and we're going to find out
right now I'm doing that evaluation myself
so I can answer this my hypothesis on this
is that ansible can do things that I can't
do with the shell script under the hood I
think it is just a bunch of shell scripts
but I believe that that's

155
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:50,798
I believe that that's the main reason is
because it codifies the configuration into a
composable way you could definitely that was
shells cribs but it would be all it's my
phone yet

156
00:33:50,800 --> 00:34:05,594
tell pythons actually turn Mica which is
which is the which was what fabric is 24 so
you can customize I think the I think the
shortest answer is composability and

157
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:39,639
I mean even if it doesn't really do anything
more than what I could have done with a show
script it doesn't and it consistent way that
is shared by millions of other people so I
would rather do that then customize my own
shell script that I have to maintain forever
and that might not be the same and it has my
own you know I already have my own
composition built into my set up scripts
right I doing it so early but if I can and
I'm already seeing what I really loved here
like if you happen to need job of God help
you if you do but if you did nothing in Java

158
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:41,506
UPS

159
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:48,578
you can you can share recipes you can share
play look so other people don't have nothing
in there that's weird

160
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:53,318
tasks

161
00:34:53,893 --> 00:35:30,577
so if you can sell job here you go it's all
set up it's it's standardized and has a
description says I just think it's a kind is
a very organized way to do it and so I feel
like it's worth learning once your
infrastructure engineer I don't think you
need to learn this if you can be a developer
or just as a beginner boost kind of thing.
It even have Skype recipes in here they're
really cool thing is I can come in here and
steal somebody else's Playbook and boom I
just get it I don't have to do anything else
and and I don't have to make it fit into my
system this really is good and video

162
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:39,217
I mean this is this is a programming all of
his program using one place pgadmin get

163
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:57,835
hey I just think it's a really great as you
shall I do not want this guy's stuff nodens
e shell yard with Emax don't I but I think
this is the new generation. Filed in fact I
probably

164
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,943
I probably been migrating my dog files
somehow

165
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:09,607
into a Playbook

166
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:15,055
I don't even know what you would call him
you call him and tell recipes I guess

167
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:20,362
it's not recipes I would say maybe we say
Play Books

168
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,620
no we were just call ansible

169
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:30,464
and is that why people call it

170
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:39,787
I think I think having a. Files directory
and then having a playbooks directory make
sense in the modern times

171
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:44,905
executing tasks

172
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:52,766
and what what what what what do you guys
what do y'all think is a nice sudo standard
for

173
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:55,252
like if I

174
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:13,245
okay so I'm trying to decide whether I
should put I should put all of my should I
put my Play Books in my. Files directory or
should I put them in

175
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:20,799
I'll toss environment date data so I think I
don't think we should call it play well I
think we should call it ansible

176
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,959
so I'm trying to figure out

177
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:36,613
so I'm trying to figure out a standard way
to document all my ansible stuff and I think
I'm just going to make a note to call
ansible don't know what reason I wouldn't
want to do that is because if I have if I
have what's the base what's what's what's
ansible

178
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:46,354
a greater than Ian Diaz was Raising play but
yeah as well so I was afraid of this

179
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,368
I don't know if I call it ansible then I
won't be able to Fork the ansible project

180
00:37:52,902 --> 00:38:03,145
even saying I won't be able to Fork it and
then work on it and do some missions of
stuff if you guys don't talk about sex one
of my biggest turn-ons as you get home you
can do this and get loud because you just
put it under a separate subdirectory

181
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:07,308
do not forget ansible why

182
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:16,116
why would I might want to Fork ansible if I
want to make a contribution that's what you
do

183
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:23,961
answers for Ryder integrated with ansible
that's what I understand we will but I don't
know

184
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:28,274
it's a play Mexican based on TV

185
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:38,837
I'm just a right now I just want answer one
question where should I

186
00:38:39,878 --> 00:38:47,408
put my stuff I kind of feel like I should
put it under my down files

187
00:38:50,732 --> 00:39:20,637
I might. I think I'm going to do that
because people if you want to find my set up
stuff I can be like oh where is that well
it's in my. Files but it's under ansible my
name is dollars everything already there so
that's kind of like the central play
somebody also I'm probably going to be
changing up like I already have installers
right I haven't saw her so a lot of my
installers ansible is the temperature of
your repo my setup ansible EnV playbooks
yeah

188
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:34,213
yeah plus I'm going to put that in your..
Files this is literally like everything that
I used to configure so I can set it and send
it to Subway so so let's do that make
directory ansible

189
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:42,858
and then inside of ansible I can make a
little thing here I'm just trying to get get
started here MD could say

190
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:47,020
my ansible

191
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:51,660
stuff

192
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,966
hanging foot warning here

193
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:05,814
a lot of this is duplicated in the installer

194
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:15,898
files for now until I can migrate it all
over so

195
00:40:15,898 --> 00:40:21,621
what do you thoughts on that so my final
product here

196
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:30,002
so I think

197
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:36,302
the final product that I want here is

198
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:44,072
a place that I can go and just have it all
configured and I feel like

199
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:55,248
the average Joe can still go find an ansible
recipe and see the code inside of it right
I'll do that cuz it's going to be written in
Python is it not

200
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:59,485
and that fucking annoys me

201
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:04,566
I hate that I'm going to have to write it on
python tell you the truth but

202
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:11,868
so be it I mean the python is a better
language for this level of scope

203
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:18,071
so I think that's my fucking might go by
when you get over there I would rather mean

204
00:41:18,072 --> 00:41:24,916
Canadian want technically because it just
calls it right this is it just call your
playbook and do its thing

205
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:36,425
yeah I think I pride okay so let's let's
actually do something here some is a python
yeah we do have bites on in here

206
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:46,459
what you are wanting to write in Python
stupid ever popped up sorry about that
because you know I have no control.

207
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:49,845
Python game

208
00:41:50,692 --> 00:42:02,009
so that mean I mean I mean okay I'm getting
ahead of myself I'm really getting ahead of
myself so I need to slow down but but I'm
thinking ahead so I wrote this OBS insta
captions plugging in like 20 minutes

209
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:11,608
in like 20 minutes about an hour I have to
test it out and everything and I was able to
write this very quickly because it's so
dense and compact right

210
00:42:12,102 --> 00:42:41,092
it's hard to read it wouldn't be a long-term
thing that I would want to keep and I have
no problem putting it over to python but I
really have no need to do that this is just
a personal installer script and I don't need
to make it like you know enterprise-worthy I
could do I could I could I could spend a
little bit more time making Enterprise
warning if somebody has a python thing they
could put it in there and put it into the
ansible they can add my my my file and they
could just add it to their setup

211
00:42:41,098 --> 00:43:33,092
you can run fashion ansible okay so assuming
you have bash on the system then I would I
could you know throw these quick-and-dirty
Discovery things which the reason everyone
who's played the bass for the house because
I can interact with a draco from the command
line while I'm figuring out the script and
if you got the script out making all the way
I wanted to and put in it and I put in a
file will if I have to thin pork the whole
batch thing into python they did the testing
on that it's going to be a pain in the ass
is not going to be the same and because this
is a using configuration it's usually you
know dealing with phone directories and
dangerous stuff I don't want to have to
rewrite it after I've already tested the
patch version but if I can take that batch
code and knowing in advance how it's going
to land in the Playbook or the task whatever
the environment and in an ansible then I can
know that in advance and I can go ahead and
put it in there I haven't seen those are
cats have it done in y'all with ansible
modules we can run the bass commands using
as with built-in

212
00:43:33,100 --> 00:44:04,393
I asked was just going to ask you the thing
right at the end of the day just connect you
and that's good that makes me feel really
good about that okay so let's let's let's
let's go for now I'm kind of trying to get
ahead of myself but I do want to I do kind
of want to start pouring my stuff over it's
just a remote as such I know that's what I'd
end of the day that's all it is right but it
but it's it's got a layer of of of
composable so so can I ask another question
up events in advance how how am I going to
share my code with others

213
00:44:05,171 --> 00:45:05,784
see I would like to make it so that I have
it include file that has everything in it
including the bash rather than having to
make a play book into its own repo or
something like that or say they go to my dog
files and I can actually make a script that
shares that Playbook with them I can say you
know give give ansible or something that
might give ansible them and and then it
would it would send them the file that has
bash in Ventura at the whole bunch of stuff
in it and my goal is that I can have
composable single files that represent an
entire install of this particular thing and
that way I can share that part of the
installer without having any any
dependencies on other things so that's where
I'm I want to go with his I don't even know
if that's possible with ansible but you can
have a fight with everything in it or
appointment that has task and send you the
files yeah I think I'm going to put tasks in
to see your files is so that those tasks can
be shared with you

214
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:19,435
when do I get to guy says he wants to ask
you fishes or something you know what I mean
they can they can if they have answerable
they can just go add it to their own
Playbook and and boom they'll get it. Get it
right I got a question if

215
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:55,852
I mean I assume you can run individual tasks
without having to run all the combination of
all the tasks so like for example if you
just want to install I mean you can use it
as kind of a performance installer you know
I mean right now I would send you the script
and run it and back but if I can do the same
I send you the ansible file and you can just
run in and just kind of argued have both are
some people don't have an answer by low so
they use the Bosch if they do they use this
right but I don't want to maintain two files
I'm kind of getting ahead of myself but I I
I do a lot of this Edition pretty quickly
just drive to Seattle from the ansible
Escape Playbook

216
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,794
okay yep

217
00:45:58,794 --> 00:46:11,032
yeah oh you talking about just just grab
that and that bit of yellow out of the
entire Playbook and then just have a single
Playboy for your entire for your time
workstation rather than breaking it all out
into its own files

218
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,858
that's interesting

219
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:27,921
I mean you can overdo it I think you know I
think it's fair to say that you can you can
overly Break Stuff up sometimes so yeah you
want to replace it out files that sounds
weird a certain number of my downfalls yes

220
00:46:27,922 --> 00:46:39,280
my deposit still be there I just I want to
be able to recreate my workstation anywhere
like that that's the main reason the main
way to doing it letters better

221
00:46:39,685 --> 00:46:42,004
yeah you can have that with everything

222
00:46:41,323 --> 00:47:26,718
you cannot play with everything or taxes in
her file for inclusion you can do some more
tests using touch this text sounds like we
got a good start on the super excited
morning handsome. I think it's an essential
skill if you want to be an infrastructure
engineer today which I am next to pay to be
one and I'd have never learn ansible but I
learned a bunch of other great stuff so I'll
be able to answer the question why ansible
instead of get him and show strips so you
should be able to have that answer available
and then we need to create a virtual machine
somehow preferably he's in chemo if you're
on Lenox and what does it matter how are you
going to respond to see no way that you can
connect you directly and do you need me to
salsa ansible on the local machine not the
virtual machine for now

223
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:36,017
I know we need to learn a lesson execrate
refers ansible set up

224
00:47:36,338 --> 00:47:46,558
okay so we already have a virtual machine
running I believe stage lists that we had a
virtual machine running

225
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:54,822
me and thing shut off is it deleted sister I
think

226
00:47:59,632 --> 00:48:01,938
I destroyed him thing

227
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:17,735
I don't know if her a verse for a while so I
just I'm just going to run virtual manager

228
00:48:18,303 --> 00:48:23,676
no virt-manager really quick just kill it
this way

229
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:32,609
doing I'm using chemo I did another video on
all of this so you can do it I'm going to
add a new one

230
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:36,752
so yeah

231
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:49,810
yeah we're going to need a new one so we
going to do

232
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:59,773
new virtual machine I look reason I suppose

233
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:04,791
I don't know if I have the one I want

234
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:08,978
I don't want to live server

235
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:17,458
how much is white and this is you don't want
that no no no I need I need to go clean
those out

236
00:49:21,114 --> 00:49:26,251
yes I CD from a very distance place to that
spot

237
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:31,400
that's because I'm using a CD pass for that

238
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:43,464
why why is it still listed there I shouldn't
be there anymore I shouldn't be listed
anymore

239
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:45,659
that doesn't exist anymore

240
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:52,986
I understand all right so I need to get one
too

241
00:49:52,987 --> 00:50:01,581
I'm going to need to download it onto the
old school way and this is something I could
have done with terraform but I'm just going
to go get it the old school way Hey look
it's me

242
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:09,656
I want to download I'm going to go get the

243
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:17,293
I don't get actually not let's go get
management workstation this is an
opportunity for me to test Linux Mint
Workstation

244
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:27,369
I like Smith's I want to make sure because I
want to get rid of Papalis eventually again
it stopped of us is going downhill fast

245
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:32,202
inflation instructions download

246
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:44,527
download cinnamon ye cinnamon is my favorite
oh I miss mint God is going to make me want
to get rid of my my OS completely

247
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:51,297
a Manitoba you can't accelerate to point one
GB installation guide

248
00:50:51,297 --> 00:51:21,895
can I feel dirty using Papalis lately I've
given all this shit that they've been doing
lately by changing apt and and a whole Russ
desktop shit I think such a diverse and they
don't need to do that absolutely hate to do
that they should be spending our time making
their operating system actually work so in
some sense it does work but they but they
totally fucked up the user interface I'm
about to prove it they did a xmission this
is this is the company I called up in

249
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:36,742
in 1993 and said what do I need to learn 94
what do I need to learn that that will give
me the maximum opportunity get a job in the
other ones that told me to learn parole
that's it that's a new task and take forever
to Jeff how to download

250
00:51:37,757 --> 00:51:43,887
it's not it's not really fast though let's
go back here

251
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:51,949
we can I download so I'm sorry but virtual
machine using Kimu

252
00:51:53,070 --> 00:52:12,191
which installs work manager in a bunch of
other things and also allows who I found out
to emulate arm chips and a bunch of other
things so I'm super glad to have found you I
have been putting off loading Kimu for a
long time because I haven't really had a
need to to do things

253
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:18,366
I honestly I haven't had a need to do things
on

254
00:52:18,786 --> 00:53:12,538
Linux virtual machine stuff on Linux if I
already had Lennox I am interested I didn't
have a really compelling need to do a lot of
stuff that way and now I do and so I'm
learning some of the stuff that I should
have learned a long time ago as an admin and
my problem is is it I'm about I'm about 60
40 software developer and to admin so I'll
talk later I have I have skills and both
sides of the fence and I'm not really deep
in either side which way she really hated
writing system software in like in a
low-level system software bug you know
enterprise system software because I can
integrate and write apps that take care of
operations doesn't like that kind of like
you know Super S sorry but but when it comes
to either deep-level like me and I don't
have haven't had that in the past so I'm
trying to up those skills little bit

255
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:34,389
I'm super excited by ansible even if it is a
python Tech then truthfully told this this
does solidly belong in the python scope in
my opinion they probably could have pulled
it off ago but given the volume of a stuff
that's already developing pythons makes good
sense to put this kind of stuff in Python

256
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:41,599
so cuz my phone's flexible enough yet you
know anyway move last

257
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:49,430
they're so now we moved it into a bunch of
images and we should be able to start up a
new VM using that

258
00:53:50,576 --> 00:53:57,307
refresh where's refresh I said how to
refresh it

259
00:53:58,584 --> 00:54:01,756
0 animation

260
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:07,556
just a minute alright They don't serve
automation that's too bad man

261
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:15,164
I know and I think that's I think that's
unfortunate I do honestly I think that's

262
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:18,629
I think that that is

263
00:54:20,394 --> 00:54:23,989
I don't know if I want to say it cuz it's
kind of mean I I think

264
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:29,715
stopping at the bottom of a plant what

265
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:39,297
stop pool it's time for I keep forgetting
this is a

266
00:54:39,298 --> 00:54:54,838
navigate me to the storage pool yeah storage
pools are a KVM thing that were very foreign
to me anything you put in here you can use
the volume very very to me a long time to
understand that because it's very specific
ATM

267
00:54:56,194 --> 00:55:00,286
we talked about not detected it's a bun to
dummy

268
00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:10,992
next weekend I'm pretty sure can I download
2010

269
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:14,184
I don't remember

270
00:55:25,347 --> 00:55:28,110
play Final Four

271
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,873
I was 20.03 why is it 2043

272
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:41,440
I don't know

273
00:55:43,547 --> 00:55:49,820
I just downloaded the latest Papa was
released and I didn't look at it I mean
sorry I didn't

274
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:59,995
I didn't look at what version was I didn't
really say tell you the truth

275
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:07,452
I should look at it 20.3 oh that's mint 20.3
I wonder if it coincides

276
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:17,442
its latest member what version of a bunch of
us since we know I don't think it's actually
a bunch of space on Debian now right

277
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:25,503
did I read that they I rather they they they
they converted over to it to Debian

278
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:34,667
I read that they did every other day they
switched over to Davion

279
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:44,047
just released so far until 3:25 play 620

280
00:56:45,477 --> 00:56:52,574
Coronavirus Anderson Silva highlights
virtualbox

281

what are transcription yoga sessions now
Denise what you demand

282
00:57:01,124 --> 00:57:04,328
I am sure that I can just put generic there
to be fine

283
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:17,554
are in 2 m I sent you when you send me
Memphis are going to know that's a hold

284
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:41,879
there's a description line it says a 2014
1040 does that mean I have a present for you

285
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,772
I don't want to have to install and go look
for I need to know

286
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:59,135
some of these windows all time Linux Mint

287
00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:05,344
Linux Mint just give you the least number of
surprises that's what I'm going for

288
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:15,605
I probably just but you know I have been
recommending Papa what's up until like last
month how's it going right

289
00:58:18,905 --> 00:58:30,877
hey put it in the virtual machine if you
don't know what Linux you want install
virtualbox and install all the different
ones you want and distro hop your heart's
content before you blow out your system

290
00:58:30,879 --> 00:58:47,372
do that then you can try out when do
managers and all that stuff that's what I'm
doing and you just know it'll be faster when
you get on your Hardware but don't don't
commit don't you into the Isle of Man I've
been using it for years but the last two
years of Asian pop

291
00:58:48,036 --> 00:58:55,792
and then they change the pop desktop I'm
like fuck this it's so bad I kind of hate it
I hate it

292
00:58:56,664 --> 00:59:02,590
and there's that whole shit by blowing up my
clinic lennis Tech tips

293
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:17,564
I download it when I want to know is what
version of Ubuntu is running or if they
switched over to Ghent is it Debbie and I
heard talk but they were going to drop

294
00:59:17,564 --> 00:59:23,567
a bunch of entirely and I don't know and
then I heard other talk that they were going
to drop snap

295
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:30,773
and I don't know if they did it with you
mean it's a double and base install it's
possible that's it is it in Bristol

296
00:59:42,106 --> 00:59:49,229
I'm pretty sure they're still built on a
bunch of but they got rid of snap that's
what I think they did

297
00:59:49,230 --> 01:00:01,868
Linux Mint with my son a bunch of This Is
2020 though I just reported a bunch of
recordings distros makes you so numb as
everything on the expense of others take all
things out

298
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:04,158
cinnamon Edition

299
01:00:04,158 --> 01:00:20,378
I know that snap is gone for sure it's 20
lbs but 21.4 or 20 then we go for a bun to
is referring to the 20.04 okay that's what
we needed that's what we need to we got that
answer so

300
01:00:20,936 --> 01:00:24,070
I probably should write that down but

301
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:30,078
so let's do that we got aren't we going to
answer go back to her manager

302
01:00:30,078 --> 01:00:33,900
3.04 which is l c s release

303
01:00:33,901 --> 01:00:39,003
it's vocal which is 20.04 if I remember
right

304
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:43,580
you got theeven though I don't know what
that

305
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:51,992
it says its long-term release so that if its
20.3 minutes probably 2104 Lenox

306
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:56,719
I just wish it could have did you forward

307
01:00:58,264 --> 01:01:14,343
I mean I I sometimes wonder about this
because I feel like that's unnecessarily you
know stealing a lot of memory but it's not
trying to do anything without four Giga Ram
is almost in specially graphically going to
be hard

308
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:18,315
and then mobile commercials

309
01:01:19,568 --> 01:01:23,555
forward play 25 GB disk

310
01:01:23,938 --> 01:01:28,651
I mean yeah I don't need a lot of this is
just I'm just automating some stuff

311
01:01:30,845 --> 01:01:42,934
I would the Debian Edition yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay now I remember thank you
thank you thank you thank you yeah they did
come out the Debian Edition and I tried it
and it sucked it didn't have support for any
drivers or anything and I left

312
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:51,382
cvms tribal distro now I used I used to work
for 15 years I'm done with it

313
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:56,862
yeah my people like red hat in the morning
if you are and all that I don't

314
01:01:56,886 --> 01:02:07,736
I don't but I can say I can say that after
having tried it for 15 fucking years and
written dozens of RPMs and dealt with red
hat I'm not I don't say that lightly

315
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:14,015
Regency directly in the terminal the chemo
because they don't know how I just know the
key move for days ago

316
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:23,645
I see internal Bubba blah black damn device
Levert images it's still fucked up because
of liver

317
01:02:24,146 --> 01:02:29,222
yeah why is it doing it from sea cow there's
no cute cow

318
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:35,948
I've totally fucked up my chemo installation
while trying to get liver to repair form

319
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:44,001
I have I definitely have I have storage

320
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:52,742
their images I did

321
01:02:55,329 --> 01:03:03,260
yeah we had this problem before I've had
this problem so many times

322
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,982
yeah

323
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:29,280
Idaho record yeah well I know that actually
I created a storage full under okay so
here's here's the thing that's so
frustrating about this this is totally new
to anybody's use virtualbox it's not the
same so when you go to do this you like a I
want to find it in my storage pool right I
sat so

324
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:37,542
if I'm using this I mean it'll grab it from
there but then it's like I don't know where
to sell it

325
01:03:47,117 --> 01:03:53,466
electric eight custom storage

326
01:03:56,488 --> 01:03:59,650
I guess I could put that in my own space
right

327
01:04:01,248 --> 01:04:06,235
they only managed yeah okay I see

328
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:12,728
pretty images now I can do it in Iceland
with just

329
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,752
anyone so fast is the rectory

330
01:04:20,752 --> 01:04:24,182
name let's do

331
01:04:27,025 --> 01:04:34,086
oh God that's very nice

332
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:40,692
my son has it closest Mercury and Kayla's
change it to

333
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:46,604
I'm going to I'm going to make a new
directory in my Honda Rancher called pools
now that I understand keep him a little
better

334
01:04:48,946 --> 01:04:51,655
full default

335
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:58,557
Why didn't it do you have a 4

336
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:08,391
whole default open

337
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:15,987
finish what when I said cinnamon

338
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:19,934
choose volume

339
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:30,371
no I don't want that is my custom storage
pool

340
01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:40,643
just like how do I make an event volume 1924
North 4th

341
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,558
incontinent

342
01:05:43,213 --> 01:05:49,143
she's cute seek our she she got to keep cows
got the thing back in stores

343
01:05:50,052 --> 01:05:57,082
allocated Tire volume now and it's fine and
this is totally different virtualbox

344
01:05:57,547 --> 01:05:59,655
so I'm glad I'm doing it

345
01:06:06,986 --> 01:06:09,497
why would my color scheme this kind of match

346
01:06:12,781 --> 01:06:18,710
beginning selection name Linux Mint

347
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:21,379
24/3

348
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:35,690
should we do net know we don't need that
because I'm going to be doing everything on
the same machine

349
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:44,192
it's name is not contain a space character
okay fine

350
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,448
vagrant sucks

351
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:04,194
I fucking hate vagrant after having spent a
full day with it it's a piece of shit

352
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:08,455
I never using it I can help it

353
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:16,918
it's absolute shit I don't know why this
didn't create this so I think I screwed up
my vert Mikey moo

354
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,829
so

355
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:30,142
no it was mine

356
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:33,535
Chris is streaming go watch Chris

357
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:45,856
I'm home Killing meccano Name Liberty
storage Auto read only true described could
not open will default permission denied how
the hell is permission denied it's in my own
home directory

358
01:07:51,227 --> 01:08:01,150
my eyes I seriously I think I fucked up you
know what I'm just going to use virtualbox I
think I fucked up my chemo installation on
this machine

359
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:06,504
because we were messing around with live
bird so much to try to get to work with your
form

360
01:08:06,618 --> 01:08:09,941
yep I'm almost positive that's what's up now

361
01:08:11,009 --> 01:08:15,514
can I complain us license renewal process
exiting while connected to

362
01:08:15,994 --> 01:08:21,834
alternate route to start a map could not
open Home default pull map

363
01:08:25,288 --> 01:08:28,621
it's a person's Aura but do you see

364
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:36,356
it's like why does it have Arisen it's not
running as me right

365
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:42,886
no I'm not starting over with another user I
don't remember doing that no

366
01:08:42,887 --> 01:08:47,191
we are messing with liver though so it's
very possible that I screwed it up

367
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:54,484
and I don't want to spend all fucking day
doing this like we did last time and this is
mrs. I'll probably just give you live

368
01:08:54,484 --> 01:08:56,646
but I want to get it to work

369
01:08:57,459 --> 01:09:03,492
so I kind of want to delete all of it and
reinstall it

370
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:09,806
does your user have like I think it was KVM
liver from which is that we did that

371
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:13,750
yeah we did this the groups

372
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:24,010
as you deliver right so a we we screwed
ourselves up by running in his room until I
had myself a liver and so I don't have liver
permissions

373
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:31,592
when I don't think cuz I don't think libert
has access to my directory you and I want to
see how I'm going to fix this

374
01:09:31,593 --> 01:09:37,006
don't do this if you're me but it did it

375
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:51,940
why did it make it as root this is a problem
we had yet last time this is the bug this is
actually a bug we found a bug in KVM about
this very thing because it changes of
permissions

376
01:09:52,016 --> 01:10:02,036
it writes it as route for some reason the
Daemon is running his route and so it
creates such that it can't even read as me
even though I'm the one in rennet we had
this person

377
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:07,603
we had this person the whole time to smoke
and get your phone really quickly it's a bug
and then we found two different bug listings
about this very thing

378
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:11,449
it's a known bug it doesn't change
permissions

379
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:17,607
it's totally fucked up it doesn't give me
confidence and keep him at all I'm going to
tell you

380
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:38,895
yeah it says because the licensing is what
was ready to recite something they are not
convinced it is not because of my initial
setup cuz I when I did the insulation
installer just rude and so and then it back
the whole thing out and now we still run for
some reason so best I can hope is to change
it after the fact

381
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:41,895
so I don't know shown

382
01:10:44,014 --> 01:10:50,115
you going to follow me after that really
thank you

383
01:10:53,493 --> 01:10:59,424
I don't know if that's going to help if
you're not yet using my KVM or system

384
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,921
I was trying to use using my KVM

385
01:11:02,942 --> 01:11:09,607
we were trying and we had myself to the
group and everything but I think there's
some residual it's like still screwed up

386
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:18,163
yes I'm going to get there to watch it's
right here where I sit

387
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:26,191
SMUD plus rewrite

388
01:11:29,713 --> 01:11:43,249
yeah it's totally fucked up yeah yeah it's
okay it just pisses me off because it should
not have been that complicated I did this
basic install for a virtual machine virtual
box is way better

389
01:11:43,517 --> 01:11:51,312
yeah this is it right here so are you guys
one more time

390
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:59,748
app close Mac cancel

391
01:12:00,114 --> 01:12:07,826
here's the liver is green virtualbox is
easier absolutely yeah

392
01:12:07,826 --> 01:12:16,272
I mean I want to learn how to use Virtual
manager virtualbox I mean stuff and I want
to learn it

393
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:19,643
but it's just not working

394
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:25,367
it's not into quite frankly virtualbox is
going to work everywhere

395
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,909
yeah

396
01:12:31,236 --> 01:12:37,968
error connecting to use our system I'm
connecting to my current machine

397
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:45,792
let's go all the way down to the chemo
that's what I wanted to do instead of using
a manager

398
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:48,353
I don't even know the difference between him

399
01:12:48,353 --> 01:13:02,539
but there is a pain in the ass that mean
it's it's anything but usable I thought it
was something I could teach a beginner
absolutely nothing cute chemo is not for
beginners because it has a so many different
ideas about how to do stuff

400
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:08,441
began Windows additions episode 2 enable yes
absolutely that you don't work together

401
01:13:08,441 --> 01:13:19,156
they both have time you can but you can have
one type 1 hypervisor and or 1 type 2 or
something you have to make sure we have the
right to refuse a bunch of them so they
fixed it eventually but yeah

402
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:22,042
Daiquiri virgin music about the absolutely

403
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:28,555
you do because virtualbox now he's the type
1 hypervisor it doesn't want to be so to be
on the same system you can only have one

404
01:13:28,556 --> 01:13:32,833
it's actually one of the reasons that that

405
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:38,179
I do you spell to is a pain in the ass for
that reason to

406
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:45,939
yeah you have to uninstall the missile to
nabeel's U-verse about to meet at least used
to it maybe fix it

407
01:13:45,941 --> 01:13:52,565
so this is doing everything is route and
it's fucked up so I'm not going to do it

408
01:13:52,566 --> 01:14:01,855
I'm going to do it I M versus box that's the
average recommendation beginners and I'm
going to go and I don't want to fuck around
this anymore

409
01:14:01,857 --> 01:14:07,128
yeah what is this

410
01:14:07,128 --> 01:14:14,842
is it Saturday or sync email setup Genesis
ice age 64

411
01:14:14,842 --> 01:14:25,462
I would rather use chemo for the command
line is that an option pay someone to
describe to me the relationship between
kemoo manager and KVM

412
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:30,021
so

413
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:41,992
so and as I understand it can use an
emulator that runs on top of KVM and you so
that you can give me that all kinds of
things including armed even though it's
running on x86 Hardware liver

414
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:52,088
Oliver is a card of high-level config and
control of chemo and others right yeah and
so they all use the birds cuz I understand
it

415
01:14:53,482 --> 01:15:34,635
this okay so does Kimu use liver or deliver
Tuesday move cuz I haven't been able to
figure that relationship out never uses them
uses can move right game is the coronavirus
in Michigan that's the lowest level and use
that instead of saying these days he will
use his KVM and liver test is used to manage
Kimu right let them know I'm sorry is that
right so the manager over to Sagebrush and
stuff give me a music station keep me with
you and the colonel emulator and liver is
the standard library to build versation all
right so so hypothetically I should be able
to use the keyboard commands I'm using
Papa's right now

416
01:15:34,641 --> 01:15:53,213
Asheville is chemo and I'm going to use
Linux Mint by discussing this cuz I'm
confused me from ya so so because I feel
like you like that I needed I didn't create
Kimu

417
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:59,912
Kimu KVM limbert

418
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:08,362
and birds

419
01:16:09,072 --> 01:16:11,833
all of her stuff right

420
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:20,296
still got a game it's just Reeboks

421
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,079
thank you for saying that you have that's
all it is

422
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:30,136
confused by the relation

423
01:16:32,066 --> 01:16:37,849
between the core components

424
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:41,916
of Linux virtualization

425
01:16:42,826 --> 01:16:48,848
I think this is how they are related

426
01:16:52,012 --> 01:16:57,309
KVM is the lowest level

427
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:06,363
and provides hey type 1 hypervisor

428
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:12,156
provides type 1 hypervisor support

429
01:17:12,498 --> 01:17:22,581
to the Linux kernel and requires a reboot to
update When A change is made

430
01:17:30,952 --> 01:17:33,397
KVM

431
01:17:33,596 --> 01:17:43,056
effectively replaces Zen and older
hypervisor

432
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:46,202
and I actually have

433
01:17:48,366 --> 01:17:54,909
send link as an I have another thing on this
one okay

434
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:10,104
it does sure does require reboot I beg to
differ I have a direct proof of that two
days ago

435
01:18:10,105 --> 01:18:18,083
yeah when you install it now

436
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:21,841
I wish that were true we try that

437
01:18:21,841 --> 01:18:37,695
and Anna I don't know we eat we tried we
tried to do that and we made some changes
and we had to reboot to get it to work
properly it was the only way so it's a good
box yet

438
01:18:39,472 --> 01:18:42,018
parcel delivery chemo

439
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:56,743
I am people keep telling me I don't need to
and then every time

440
01:18:56,743 --> 01:19:03,113
yeah I have all think eyes are nice that's
great for Lenox

441
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:21,201
yep so I don't know if it was because of
libert library or anything else but I'm
pretty sure it was a

442
01:19:20,592 --> 01:19:31,244
rebooted give you theirs there are certain
things about them you can't change people
kept telling me to just restart the liver
Damon service and it was not enough

443
01:19:31,784 --> 01:19:41,225
yeah liver Liberty we did at Liberty
restarts and in it sometimes we will fix
some things but not most things

444
01:19:53,158 --> 01:20:00,234
so what so what is Lynn Verdi let's talk
about that so

445
01:20:05,471 --> 01:20:09,694
limbert and Lindbergh

446
01:20:12,215 --> 01:20:16,403
yeah and liver and Liberty

447
01:20:18,884 --> 01:20:20,728
are that

448
01:20:27,845 --> 01:20:33,848
is the library chat line for me

449
01:20:34,688 --> 01:20:37,545
is the library

450
01:20:41,262 --> 01:20:47,273
is the library in that uses KVM to get that
right

451
01:20:53,843 --> 01:21:01,366
Liberty is a library that uses KVM it's the
thing that so tell me if I'm wrong here

452
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:09,457
the day is Damon yes I know other people
probably need to know that the DS for Damon

453
01:21:10,536 --> 01:21:14,521
so chemo

454
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:18,870
is an application

455
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:24,525
that uses liver or does his liver use KVM

456
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:33,169
it's just Joseph

457
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:52,000
I don't know that's why I doubt I don't know
what's true what's true does Kimu use liver
and his liver Tuesday moo

458
01:21:53,062 --> 01:22:01,039
is allowing to be a run near the Hardware
close in Cornelius got it hi

459
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:11,292
the kind of bad time but what no for me it's
not going to be for an hour at least I'm
sorry

460
01:22:11,683 --> 01:22:17,246
Reverend Kenneth Fairley knighted KVM Santee
xxi

461
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,667
okay okay okay okay I didn't look it up

462
01:22:27,672 --> 01:22:33,210
that provides emulation for

463
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:40,151
many machine architectures

464
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:48,612
is that right architech

465
01:22:49,122 --> 01:22:51,160
checkers

466
01:22:55,087 --> 01:23:02,826
including arm simulation on KVM

467
01:23:02,827 --> 01:23:07,923
Ansari on x86

468
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:13,358
machines whenever May 64

469
01:23:20,437 --> 01:23:25,925
so am I right that

470
01:23:27,992 --> 01:23:30,493
uses

471
01:23:32,559 --> 01:23:39,162
any one of several virtualization

472
01:23:39,163 --> 01:23:43,044
methods

473
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:47,953
including

474
01:23:47,953 --> 01:23:53,909
including KVM this is Suzanne with an
accident.

475
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:59,119
Is sex I which is Linda got sued for it

476
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:09,366
yeah Iyeah I know delivered that's another
good one

477
01:24:10,548 --> 01:24:12,305
I provide that link

478
01:24:13,908 --> 01:24:20,034
I wasn't planning on doing this in one of
your answer will but I need to get this
capture because this is driving me nuts

479
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:30,409
sorry about your salvation concept whoops
dammit

480
01:24:31,162 --> 01:24:41,304
this artery delivers going out of control by
the Cuban KVM the most complimentary

481
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:53,097
there are different tools

482
01:24:53,761 --> 01:25:09,947
acid on Terra Firma different tools is that
I started reading about virtualization
concept I haven't realized I think terraform
for provision forget standing up stuff and
answerable for configuring but I've been
told people to the opposite so we're just
going to look at it

483
01:25:10,187 --> 01:25:35,595
did you survive a collision concert I've
been trouble by keeping KVM I can tell you
already that I like the ansible they do way
better than HCL from terraform so if I had
to pick between one and suppose probably
going to be winning with me I've been told
like it back here until they both have the
same give him when you get back in a
relationship and hypervisor KVM is just the
hypervisor that I know that part I know

484
01:25:37,397 --> 01:25:44,513
then we can deliver liver is quite innocent
since that it doesn't confuse you it is
simply a virtualization management Library
that's it okay

485
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:49,759
so is a

486
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,302
all right

487
01:25:59,527 --> 01:26:05,196
it does both KVM and Camus it consists of
three utilities

488
01:26:08,003 --> 01:26:13,380
accessory utilities name with Avi the Damon
and come in like 20 of your Sage

489
01:26:24,964 --> 01:26:27,828
alright sorry

490
01:26:29,842 --> 01:26:40,866
I am going to kill myself over his wife
actually got to take him you can manage a
lot of papers together so when are we using
all these things and remember there is a
hypervisor accelerated aging accelerating
agent and Imagine Learning

491
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:43,476
all right that's good

492
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:56,103
I want to Key Bank ATM yeah that's what
you're saying well

493
01:26:56,103 --> 01:26:58,646
medicine medicine what's yes

494
01:27:24,537 --> 01:27:26,847
this more popular

495
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:57,910
are there different rules though I know I
don't group terraforming ansible together
yet but if I had to pick which configuration
recipe language to write in it would be mo
all day everyday I would know that over and
over over the revised rhcl I don't I don't
like a stale at all I didn't like writing it
when I was doing it and I'm I I'm not a fan
I know they're trying to do something better

496
01:27:57,912 --> 01:28:22,732
the different tools of the right we we kept
saying this out of that if I got it wrong on
me no but my most people that I've talked to
most people will tell you that terraform is
for Bri up virtual machines and providers of
components has in volumes and stuff and
getting them ready and ansible is for
keeping them configured

497
01:28:22,733 --> 01:28:42,042
terraform you know we're going to Forum
something new and ansible is for
communicating this way ansible means it
means you know it's a play on words but it
means you're keeping speed of light
configuration of communication keeping
things constantly the same so as I see it
and symbols for keeping things in sync
including the first time you

498
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:45,961
including the first time you can figure
something and terraform is for creating
something

499
01:28:47,374 --> 01:28:49,664
which is implied by their names

500
01:28:51,508 --> 01:28:59,607
I don't want to jeopardize our kind of a
concept think of him as a type 2 why it's
got a it's got its got Hardware support

501
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:07,023
is it going to wash in Linux connect to
service the current on the floor if you have
space for this type to you than you yeah

502
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:12,796
I thought Katie I thought Kevin was a type
one I thought it I thought it enable to type
1

503
01:29:14,715 --> 01:29:19,524
I don't even know if I should die yeah okay
I did not know that

504
01:29:28,807 --> 01:29:34,957
I thought it was a type one I thought it an
able to type one access

505
01:29:39,569 --> 01:29:44,599
Kaiser Village again but still have him to
control have to measure yeah

506
01:29:44,873 --> 01:29:51,203
didn't realize that okay nice

507
01:29:51,917 --> 01:30:04,062
I didn't realize it was this that it's got
to be a fucking fast time to Ivan Biser then
normally when you hear type 2 you think
virtual machine like me like you know like
like versus a box of VMware and software
mode

508
01:30:04,758 --> 01:30:10,723
it sounds like no right that's super
interesting to me

509
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:15,121
yeah

510
01:30:16,701 --> 01:30:24,724
I think Thursday is at Liberty how long is
beyond Serenity run has its own user other
vacuum came out all the files that touches

511
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,552
now that is the owner

512
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:41,858
the way the way it's running right now
everything is route

513
01:30:41,992 --> 01:30:51,380
my my liver Dee is running his route and it
does everything is rude and we uncovered two
specific bugs that have not been fixed

514
01:30:51,815 --> 01:31:13,062
we speak up we uncovered two specific bugs
that have not been fixed in Liberty related
to that and I put them in the thing at least
we fought with that for 8 hours trying to
get terraform to her with a local liver
provider and it kept fucking ass over
because it kept changing it to route
permissions on the volume to even the matter
how much we we could have figured it out

515
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:23,691
it was here it was on Papa less and they
kept saying it was like yeah we were doing
this local system I don't know

516
01:31:23,691 --> 01:32:12,236
I have no idea someone tell me I don't give
a shit I'm just telling you what it did and
you decide to hang out again I ran Levert
some people suggest it is because I
installed the software his route and Iran
Iran manager for the first time is roots and
they backed it out and try to hurry back it
in and then we couldn't get it fixed and we
didn't have a stable system we spent we we
burned about 8 hours trying to fix that shit
and then we found the bugs related to it
that no matter what you do it will still it
shows it actually shows it to the running to
to Reuters whatever it is and there's a
configuration and chemo at the keyboard to
to mess with it ha connect to be nearly as
fast as these days it was the worst dancers
make these perform really well nice / 11 is
the Colonel's processor model with you two
crazies and processes and ice

517
01:32:12,245 --> 01:32:36,594
give you a massage when I want to lose you
as a girlfriend smile with chemo so you tell
me KVM actually calls chemo emulates a lot
of devices Anyway season and I'm usually
more companies yeah, Lise if you have a
really good reason to just have fun give me
a place to rehearse where I said 400-yard
stream live anywhere with you

518
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:39,548
let me talk to you since I want a visor

519
01:32:39,549 --> 01:32:49,908
and I understand that that let the little
box uses it is a type of these days if you
have it if it detects it'll use it but I
don't know

520
01:32:49,974 --> 01:32:55,401
Team Umizoomi space talk to the KVM in the
colonel yeah okay

521
01:33:03,441 --> 01:33:09,423
and talks to do the colonel

522
01:33:09,891 --> 01:33:16,930
through KVM yeah

523
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:22,713
so yeah you're actually limited even know
what your C

524
01:33:22,968 --> 01:33:43,785
and if we supposed to have sex when you're
extremely limited yes interesting to give me
images of space toxic ATM in the colonel IQ
is about to pull for emulated networking
devices just cuz I see Sarah I know your
network devices yes and it emulates arm to
which is really amazing they gave him is
responsible for safe CPU

525
01:33:43,955 --> 01:33:45,370
modes

526
01:33:46,334 --> 01:33:53,060
Patriots on TV is actually also type to
really

527
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,736
sza type 1

528
01:34:00,438 --> 01:34:09,281
I did not know that I did not know that that
I got that wrong in I swear to God I read it
a different way but again my memory is
really bad so

529
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:24,514
I had to go talk to box

530
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:38,088
so so so so so Douglas L2 is level type too
interesting to type 2

531
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,914
interesting Okay so

532
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:49,445
a cumulus application in user-specified
simulation machine architectures including
arm simulation on x86

533
01:34:50,037 --> 01:35:02,721
other thing is that it's not too bad enough
you went to the wrong blog post should be
viewing it from our sexual standpoint and
we're very Colonel's usual ants live at the
separation used to make a grooming
interesting

534
01:35:02,737 --> 01:35:17,322
interesting that's that's super interesting
to me wrong that's why I want to write I
really don't care I just I wanted to work
quickly excetera and there's a lot of you
know stuff that you just want to work by 2
a.m.

535
01:35:18,027 --> 01:35:39,776
but yeah I took email Kim calls into the KVM
and liver disease vs. these are all together
and they give you the virtualization that
you need for anything and have a great thing
I thought was interesting is that in order
to to had to restart Liberty but I had to
change at Sachi move stuff

536
01:35:40,433 --> 01:36:40,393
mother of Jesus run as yes it is mine I
tried to tell everybody why is it when your
urine has to run his route so that the bug
about it if you want to know there's a
there's a bug that says that Liberty is
showing the new volumes and into roof and
that is the reason for the conflict has
ulcers in the provider doesn't work we
thought it was the provided was doing it
wrong I love her key provider in fact when I
do terraform again I'm not going to use the
local Liberty provide her because that's
less support I'm actually going to say it's
just a provider and make a VM when the
reason I'm doing this I want to make I want
to make a terraform client VM and I'm going
to use my host OS as a pseudo server and
then I'll connected to an inter Arma. If I
need to but I'm going to try out to do this
all with ansible by itself and then out the
fuck with all that stuff then I'll just get
another server later with molten core and
I'll just use terraform as God intended and
and Stan

537
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:56,551
I'm up and then use the ansible to take a
figure that's that's my my goal anyway so
that would be most consistent with how you
would you would work with it in the cloud
from what people who know better than me or
telling me anyway so

538
01:36:57,748 --> 01:37:02,280
I think this is a pretty good breakdown of
the differences

539
01:37:06,972 --> 01:37:13,776
alright so let's go ahead and say that I
just needed to get that saved

540
01:37:13,776 --> 01:37:29,517
you my favorite types of a use case as an
essential has its own schedule her for a
chelation drivers about the current I don't
want to use end because I've heard people
don't use it anymore I read that whole
article and from Amazon about the migration
of Zen to the KVM

541
01:37:29,519 --> 01:37:33,047
yeah I wrote about that so

542
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:37,604
Amazon drops in

543
01:37:39,664 --> 01:37:57,889
I didn't buy the future released versus
everybody's concern Elsa 2019 Amazon Nitro
on KVM and drops and Kimmy I'm required to
her support for virtualization and see this
is what I don't understand they said that
they wanted a type 1 hypervisor and a KVM
provided in your telling me something
completely different

544
01:37:57,891 --> 01:38:04,394
so you know I feel I feel like I got that
got that wrong

545
01:38:07,063 --> 01:38:26,333
I-77 is type 1 or type 2 and this is if you
don't perform instead of sending wrong if
you can before we had rather a risk and
Emily's and keep him for everything as a
method for meeting up with Hardware like
everything you're telling me is completely
against what I read in the Amazon Plus most
makes me want to find the Amazon post

546
01:38:26,336 --> 01:38:34,179
Amazon drops zen zen for KVM I I need to
find this

547
01:38:35,036 --> 01:38:45,713
big truck games that are source of
information in code camp

548
01:38:46,308 --> 01:38:54,067
I would not be the first time I've been
fucked over by that's place I swear to God

549
01:38:54,916 --> 01:38:58,840
watch it be because of this shity article

550
01:38:59,598 --> 01:39:17,397
he's into it because they require really
thin idioms something Amazon using no they
don't directly, Colonel function with any
special crazy and Paige ensuring that could
have some type of calls injection faults are
the type to if it needs a special mechanism
is Stefan interesting

551
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:21,446
is it for a tattoo for your use case

552
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:34,775
what's he doing this why I'm confused. Okay
so tell us what it is easy to high end
stores time is strong suggestion that Amazon
cloud computing giant has begun to shift

553
01:39:37,309 --> 01:39:39,241
here's another one

554
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:54,208
the register is a reliable source they've
been pretty rare that they were the ones
that broke the the Snowden story and a bunch
of other think it's hypervisor I want to
read that instead

555
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:01,393
I was in in with Corky and technology for a
see if I missed this feature VMAs 2017

556
01:40:02,924 --> 01:40:09,738
mine's I just change it you want me to say
here you go

557
01:40:11,927 --> 01:40:16,657
and see is everything secure in there there
isn't right

558
01:40:18,276 --> 01:40:24,410
did you remember I don't remember if I have
tokens in there or not I don't think I do

559
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,165
give me a sec while I look up

560
01:40:36,694 --> 01:40:39,740
free Camp courses are shit

561
01:40:40,080 --> 01:41:40,842
York's absolute shit I would not waste one
second over there there JavaScript steps a
little bit better but they're absolute shit
I seriously I would I would not do it I
actually have tested 40 people who went
through their web certified program not a
single one can make a web page after it and
then I I cannot tell you how much I disagree
with their entire approach their approaches
get the carrot get the piece of paper move
on there's no active recall there's no
there's no practice is no repetition and
then people ask him questions online on
their Twitter feed and Quincy says to him
well obviously it's not enough to get a job
you have to do another 2,000 hours of work
why don't you start there and throw them out
the fucking window their content is so bad
it actually teaches you stuff incorrectly in
multiple places I cannot overstate my
disagreement with people doing freecodecamp
I agree it's exactly what you would expect
from a former Middle School

562
01:41:40,846 --> 01:42:25,562
principal who goes to a boot camp to change
careers and decides he's going to start is
going to change the world by kraddy
freecodecamp but that's his first project
without actually asking anyone with actual
knowledge of the topic to do it and after
the fact has been like playing catch-up ever
since then I have no love for what they're
doing I wonder what he's doing I think it's
a great it's a noble cause of the lab people
got jobs for Pico camp but I absolutely
despise that is a platform there aren't the
Odin project a little bit better learn with
me on is actually saying he's got some good
stuff but if you're going to do web
development I got no information if you did
what was best for you for the loan is to
make your own program for Learning and learn
how to learn and set up your own system for
learning

563
01:42:25,567 --> 01:42:31,992
stop depending on you to me or some quarters
or some book and make your own program

564
01:42:31,992 --> 01:42:39,019
go find people who are actually employed
doing this job and ask them what they think
you should learn

565
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,985
no se learn this and learn that so then you
go do your internet research

566
01:42:40,529 --> 01:43:41,150
you go do your internet research and you
create your own curriculum with starting
with a list of the things that you need to
learn now we're trying to help you with
something called open credentials so that
you can see what you need to learn I'm not
mad at you by the way I just I'm super
frustrated because code academy of
freecodecamp.org to some extent they teach
you shit that's wrong it's not even based on
any you know what I did I can't drive
anymore they gamify the shit out of it
people come out of it with a certificate
they think they know something in fact or
even more dangerous because now they're
injected with unearned confidence and then
go try to get a job but I do try to do
something they don't have any portfolio
everything smells like a tutorial those are
Leon's worth the end and they have nothing
to prove it they would have been better
served by asking a professional finding an
actual professional and asking him say can
you spend 10 minutes telling me what do you
think what it is I need to learn to say I
need you to learn X and Y and Z and then you
setup your own project and you go learn
those

567
01:43:41,159 --> 01:44:06,670
can you put that stuff in privately and
you're getting a repo and you manage your
own learning and now guess what you've got
the skills necessary to continue instead of
being dependent on freecodecamp forever or
free code whatever the fuck it is I'm sorry
I just my opinion on that has gotten a
little bit more grumpy over the over the
years because I keep getting asked about it
and if you know that then you can go into
and you can use it as a resource okay but
yeah

568
01:44:07,165 --> 01:44:10,427
you don't need to prove you got mentored by
a professional

569
01:44:10,772 --> 01:44:15,899
your proof is what you can show its what you
have delivered

570
01:44:16,724 --> 01:44:18,827
all right I'm done

571
01:44:24,882 --> 01:44:30,748
Dynamic ownership I don't think there's
anything in here that so

572
01:44:30,926 --> 01:44:35,554
max to change one variable in this sand and
I haven't rebooted since then

573
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:42,938
my I don't have anything in here this is
just the standard ones so

574
01:44:46,112 --> 01:44:47,411
Etsy

575
01:44:48,362 --> 01:45:04,286
and you can tell me to take a hike your then
charge of your own learning if you like it
if you can respond to me to get a job that
you would do something good about if we go
again freecodecamp and the Odin project have
fantastic communities if anybody getting a
job is because of the community it's not
because of the material

576
01:45:06,127 --> 01:45:09,449
Lynx Academy

577
01:45:09,934 --> 01:45:48,926
is that what you're learning that there's
some place to get free stuff in and have the
best way to learn is to just experiment with
things my hands now and that's the way
you're going to be learning for the rest of
your life as a technology professionals to
might as well get used to it and it makes
you uncomfortable sitting up your own
learning labs in your own learning
environments and writing down their own
steps in your own goals about what you need
to learn and then just going out and doing
the research to do that that makes you
uncomfortable get the fuck out of Technology
because that's what it is that's what the
job is as Liam says it's a lifestyle it's a
lifestyle you commit forever to managing
your own learning not to asking people where
you should go to learn the next thing you
need to know how to do that yourself as the
first thing you need to learn

578
01:45:49,626 --> 01:45:59,159
here's some covid-19 South KB I'm in Lenox
included including the external interface
has one thing at a time I'm getting kind of
distracted that's all right

579
01:46:00,759 --> 01:46:07,566
UPS so here's my chemo chemo file

580
01:46:11,988 --> 01:46:14,802
why is it doing that

581
01:46:18,507 --> 01:46:21,613
at City Live Birds

582
01:46:25,717 --> 01:46:29,613
chemo chemo isn't in there

583
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:45,301
can never type this what do you mean
permission denied

584
01:46:53,948 --> 01:47:01,868
cannot type today give me hear Mozzy

585
01:47:01,943 --> 01:47:09,102
this is my don't get upset just get busy
mascot

586
01:47:18,476 --> 01:47:20,726
there's my

587
01:47:24,535 --> 01:47:27,398
learn how to be like yes absolutely

588
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:36,830
are some code nice out give you a goddamn
open link in a new tab

589
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:48,163
yeah I want to I want to grab all this so
you guys are being very helpful today I need
I need to have

590
01:47:48,528 --> 01:47:52,490
I need to have this stuff in in my Latin
learning

591
01:47:53,935 --> 01:48:00,692
Alright set edit I appreciate the references
are just going to be able to do fast

592
01:48:05,406 --> 01:48:06,469
pissed

593
01:48:12,217 --> 01:48:14,095
all right what is this now

594
01:48:16,447 --> 01:48:21,203
succezz so junky says

595
01:48:21,545 --> 01:48:28,685
nice I gave him his Lenox includes use his
lunch Colonel interface is here but Zen uses
its own

596
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:32,997
rental wedding function on your different
way interesting

597
01:48:33,235 --> 01:48:38,317
God damn this is great information copy link
address I got to put this out there for
everybody else

598
01:48:40,329 --> 01:48:41,952
documents

599
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:55,052
the other one and

600
01:48:55,316 --> 01:49:01,687
hey since escape this is an right I said a
document

601
01:49:02,807 --> 01:49:07,935
so if you guys want to look up this stuff
and putting it in. So you can go read it
instead of getting lost

602
01:49:16,287 --> 01:49:28,233
that comparing TVM and Zen code in the
kernel source can be

603
01:49:29,235 --> 01:49:32,959
a way to understand the difference

604
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:41,559
let's put KVM xen vertebrate

605
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:50,827
I'm going to put in the dock so I don't get
lost I want to say when I'm bored how can I

606
01:49:51,113 --> 01:49:57,521
I know we're going to try that trying to
keep up with all the great comments here

607
01:49:57,835 --> 01:50:06,836
but I was going to buy the Steeler things to
try to figure out what's on the first
absolutely knowing what to learn is the
first step and I I did a boost for that
reason

608
01:50:07,569 --> 01:50:12,091
and I tried to create the the ocms

609
01:50:14,231 --> 01:51:15,102
standard as a way to to help provide a list
of what you need to learn that's the very
first thing you need to figure out the best
way to do that is to is to ask people like
like chunky still chunky still knows the
questions to ask about KVM and then I have
to battle is getting people who fucking know
what they're talking about to tell you where
to go you don't have to tell them teach me
everything you have to say tell me what I
need to learn where to go to look for the
stuff because I am willing to do the
research I just don't know what to look for
and that's where a mentor is absolutely
indispensable and educator who try to give
you a theory that's three levels removed
from some other book and some other place is
never going to get you the right information
unless it's about an academic topic like
Quantum Computing find somebody who actually
does this shit somebody who commits to the
colonel and ask him the difference between
Zen and KVM and Jose basically it's this and
here's the line of code you can go check on
to give it to any changes it those are the
people that are going to give you

610
01:51:15,112 --> 01:51:43,515
true learning they gave you the best
possible learning and build yourself a
professional Personal Learning Community
surrounded by these people even if you're
just a fanboy and you're following them all
the time and you got a list of these people
that's how you should learn you don't go
follow some X principles idea of what
freecodecamp should be so they everybody can
learn it you go to the top of the profession
to go to the Masters Class the mentors to
get as high as you can and you ask them what
you should learn and then you don't bother
him with the rest

611
01:51:43,519 --> 01:51:55,790
that's the way it didn't truly learn that's
the way we've been learning from greybeards
I thought was a sexist term but that's the
way we've been doing it and eunuchs world
since the dawn of time there's never been a
class on Unix anywhere

612
01:51:55,792 --> 01:52:02,286
it's always been taught it's always been
mentoring and apprenticeship I do reach I do
reach at

613
01:52:02,912 --> 01:52:05,352
but I don't necessarily read

614
01:52:06,117 --> 01:52:18,629
which one you talking about the Discord chat
I'm doing something else right now at the
box I don't know you're asking questions on
related but my board is old how can I set up
a server on a bun to

615
01:52:19,162 --> 01:52:22,455
you just download a bunch of Anna saw it

616
01:52:23,822 --> 01:52:27,771
are USB stick you need to burn a USB stick
that's how

617
01:52:30,252 --> 01:52:31,920
Okay so

618
01:52:34,405 --> 01:52:40,018
I used to know house to pay PSI do I do
sometimes it's easier I didn't use enough
space here though

619
01:52:41,038 --> 01:52:48,451
I just announced the pace from I use the
mouse because I grabbed it I grab the URL
from from twitch

620
01:52:49,607 --> 01:53:40,022
so that is the most efficient way to do that
like I could have twitch up in another
window and go copy the coffee and the
chaplain WeChat and everything I have done
you know what I actually had a command it
was called last it was called last URL and
it would do that it would like to follow the
chat but it's but it's gotten a WeChat fi
phone lags it's not a fit after waiting 10
minutes for 5 minutes for it to show up once
I get it bought once I get it bought for me
to post any stuff from the chat I can just
post I can just do bang bang last and it
will grab the last URL from the chat yeah
that's coming problem with that is is it
WeChat is too slow it doesn't it doesn't
commit to the 50 fast enough and so I can't
grab the URLs fast enough that the logs I
mean it it it buffers the logs only writes
them every few seconds and it sits too long
it's not as affected by the time I want it's
always pulled out the screen

621
01:53:40,347 --> 01:53:51,282
a couple of good courses on Unix nice not
aware of any likes wants these two extension
really going to jail that's nice teach me a
c

622
01:53:51,428 --> 01:53:56,972
learning Linux command line is another free
good book I mean these are all is lots of
the resources right there

623
01:53:59,093 --> 01:54:01,557
let me see if I have anything on this

624
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:12,621
I had lots of Lenox stuff so it can be hard
to isolate

625
01:54:20,572 --> 01:54:28,014
is that create Onyx learning resources

626
01:54:33,432 --> 01:54:35,627
but young Annex

627
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:44,605
hey look paste from the command line non
command line

628
01:54:45,807 --> 01:55:23,752
schedules and routes as nice as good to you
as if I really want to get into I know I
want to get back to ansible here but all I
wanted to do is get a virtual machine that
works at the end of the day and for
beginners and the clear answer here is don't
use chemo and leave it and liver don't just
don't use it I hate to say that but that's
that's that's the facts of the matter it's
it's too I don't know I feel like it's I
don't feel like it's baked I haven't had to
finish reading this because I think I got it
wrong again

629
01:55:23,755 --> 01:55:36,115
New York New York hypervisor unveiled is
virtually brand-new ez2ac 5 news has long
championed sin is in Project can do one or
two

630
01:55:38,537 --> 01:55:44,227
why don't you see those databases you if you
think going forward we use everybody to
Paradise Tonight

631
01:55:45,596 --> 01:55:52,020
what's that of course nice

632
01:55:53,804 --> 01:55:56,803
is that at last

633
01:55:58,839 --> 01:56:21,107
thank you for that I'm going to keep those
up and put him in my set you guys know about
me is that right so if you want to go follow
that you can just follow the GitHub repo and
it will notify you any time I updated there
it is it's got all my stuff that's as I
video transcription using CC as well so if
you want to search you can do that

634
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:24,737
I'm I just had at this week super happy
about that

635
01:56:24,887 --> 01:56:31,379
I have closed captioning enabled as a two
days ago, Castleton

636
01:56:31,379 --> 01:56:42,054
you can go to see it so if it's that is that
query

637
01:56:41,316 --> 01:56:48,094
those two things to give you plenty of
information if you want to answer that
question because it'll be as long as
champions in

638
01:56:48,643 --> 01:57:08,459
Cumming 400 series this hypervisor sounds a
lot like a dumb ass is giving Zen the flick
you have a long way toward explaining why I
do this is the last of the big clouds to run
Intel's new Skylake Xeon CPUs because it has
also revealed the new C5 instances and tell
us both say

639
01:57:11,291 --> 01:57:17,092
that some stuff until 7 Customs yes for a
while

640
01:57:17,685 --> 01:57:32,030
give me to give me a surprise in batavia's
does whatever is needed to tune its Cloud
for auto performance that means building a
hypervisor and making sure it's okay they
just said building a hypervisor

641
01:57:32,381 --> 01:57:34,634
so that would mean type 2

642
01:57:34,876 --> 01:57:51,024
and making sure it hooks into Customs eons
to some beer whenever it feels in three
weeks is this I believe I got it wrong and
that summary whatever evils in the next 3
weeks into this is now saying that C5
instances in the visor are about facet
referred as an advantage being a Prius past
the network

643
01:57:51,530 --> 01:58:02,788
here's the day Joe said to send it back
didn't have a razor for Amazon ec2
introduced the launch of C-5 mysticism is a
component that normally provide CPR
memorization okay

644
01:58:05,593 --> 01:58:12,636
is built on Courtland KVM technology but
does not include Jennifer suffering system
components

645
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:28,645
it isn't only modify give him extensively
and because they don't distribute anyone its
private for them it was probably easier for
the to do so a KVM that it was within its a
hurry up yeah I think I think they made
their own type 2 hypervisor I think that's
the way to say it right

646
01:58:28,992 --> 01:58:32,714
I think I think that's that's what I'm
trying to say here

647
01:58:36,293 --> 01:58:44,793
adopts Homebrew KVM yeah homework avms new
hypervisor so I have some errors in this

648
01:58:53,975 --> 01:59:01,514
I sell for their own Homebrew KVM so

649
01:59:05,144 --> 01:59:12,400
did you give him requires Hardware support
for virtualization that's not true

650
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:18,340
that's not that's not true I swear to God I
read that though

651
01:59:21,638 --> 01:59:25,077
I got it wrong based on everything that you
just said

652
01:59:26,865 --> 02:00:01,992
now I don't think people KVM I don't care
it's my day off don't give me shit is it
possible to run Ubuntu on a Chromebook and
do the thing I should probably change my
stop and go seek and it's a pain in the ass
know you can try and it'll pay your
Chromebook is a Chromebooks really only have
to take it apart and take a screw out of it
otherwise I won't let you change the OS no
shit we actually tried it depends on how old
your Chromebook is the later, books they
have full support for Lennox installs they
made a big deal about in the news make sure
you do that research and look at your exact.

653
02:00:01,996 --> 02:00:29,930
Is my tab a comparison have you seems to
have stripped down all external Dennis was
breaking point of seizures run in for him so
he takes it more more of it more of a type
two type want to see if I can remember
mostly Colonel functionality there isn't
really a part of the Osa more it is running
this case interesting I just moved from
Tenny KVM because they are I aren't you
instance type Nitro yeah I can project for
the service he didn't fire cracker right

654
02:00:29,935 --> 02:00:33,278
yeah and firecrackers the whole rust thing
didn't talk about so

655
02:00:33,872 --> 02:00:40,435
I don't know how you're going to do research
on which one of work these days if

656
02:00:41,291 --> 02:00:48,752
if you need any relation you're doing
something wrong I don't care if I don't know
what the fuck that means Rob

657
02:00:48,752 --> 02:00:59,493
I might have got that wrong I got to find
the source I should this weather-related
section is so important to keep track of
your sources as to me I'd rather never risk
it Wednesday KVM for

658
02:01:01,155 --> 02:01:06,792
I only using KVM for everything as a method
of eating out my old Harbor from the new

659
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:11,667
which is so serious I don't even think that
that is relevant

660
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:20,431
I don't as a hey thanks Tamara

661
02:01:27,236 --> 02:01:34,802
okay if they don't have Hardware support

662
02:01:35,838 --> 02:01:40,552
I really didn't know this is not homework
avmc hypervisor

663
02:01:42,631 --> 02:01:46,181
Adventures of Peace key. The maze if you ski

664
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:54,908
I can see it's working and KVM to most
people if they know exactly where they needs
in Veracruz in to do the research and look
for Dakota yeah

665
02:01:56,068 --> 02:02:08,010
we only use KVM it might not work on my solo
Mesa if they don't have time for this is why
I ran into this morning about proxmox I do
remember that so

666
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:15,364
where where are we 5

667
02:02:15,976 --> 02:03:03,305
I am going to finish this article and where
you go back to where we were I might have to
stand up and take a break cuz I'm down to
the big old Rabbit Hole like email or Bosch
it it would even work without our support
but every Garcia because chemo does
emulation right I feel like I'm getting
honestly I have never really had my head
around and Lenox virtualization I never have
and I Lenox personalization is at the core
of cloud so if you really truly want to be a
kick-ass 10x do you know infrastructure
engineer you really should understand
virtualization like at the court you should
understand how the colonel is organized into
were so close everything and I don't and
that's why I'm getting into this I did I
also want to just can't picture my local VM
but it's a good opportunity to look at this

668
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:08,998
Jack 64 news station

669
02:03:09,958 --> 02:03:30,703
is it recommend KVM to most people assume
that you don't really understand it because
because of the way it is percentage of
people is that black box is a clear division
between them when they really have to do my
thing yeah yeah hypervisor what even is a
hypervisor right I mean is it there

670
02:03:30,893 --> 02:03:34,189
is hypervisor firmware in

671
02:03:34,189 --> 02:03:44,029
is it I mean what what the literally is a
hybrid by type 1 hypervisor I assume it's
firmware on the chip

672
02:03:44,045 --> 02:03:51,574
right I mean it would have to be into
something like how can it it's like a GPU
where it's like an instruction sets it's
been burned into a chip

673
02:03:51,657 --> 02:03:55,008
and I that's what I'm kind of curious

674
02:03:56,739 --> 02:04:03,610
network storage done elsewhere and did you
ever measure provides consistent performance
increase computer memory

675
02:04:03,719 --> 02:04:17,920
install new exercise for losing u e j e c t
i v Riser but in the near-term so many
successful use and depending on the
requirements of my phone is running on the
new easy to type of hypervisor PCI devices

676
02:04:19,103 --> 02:04:24,680
does not work that regulation well yeah

677
02:04:27,507 --> 02:04:33,668
check the FAQ a review CPU is a single
thread on a on a physical CVS thing

678
02:04:33,668 --> 02:04:36,391
yeah I think we're done with this one

679
02:04:39,572 --> 02:04:55,480
Azure content that's very nice expert she
welcomed good to see you it's really not me
it's people like Chomsky setting me straight
I'm just I'm just a fool in front of the
camera

680
02:04:57,179 --> 02:05:09,276
it's true it's true I'm Just a Fool in front
of the camera and gets schooled by other
people actually know and I guess that makes
for good entertainment

681
02:05:10,103 --> 02:05:18,013
so yeah anyway yeah I got to make sure this
is updated

682
02:05:18,014 --> 02:05:21,992
all right we're getting back to the topic I
promise

683
02:05:24,973 --> 02:05:39,615
I just need a break though I've been going
pretty hot and heavy on this again the topic
is using ansible to setup your workstation
as opposed to shell script to buy to do that
and I'm going to

684
02:05:39,616 --> 02:05:49,113
put up the read me of the stuff at work
where we anticipate working on while I take
a break so I shall be back

685
02:05:49,519 --> 02:05:57,720
I should be back in about 8 minutes here and
I'm going to make some food so I'll be back
in 9 minutes

686
02:06:00,278 --> 02:06:02,714
so see you in a bitsee you in a bit

687

like yeah I do I do the whole thing the
whole gamut cuz I can't get enough I'll be
back in a bit

693
02:19:27,136 --> 02:19:32,647

did you know ansible has cows a support that
things are in a meeting until he was half a
cow's starts popping up all nice musica

709
02:22:01,590 --> 02:22:05,432
I'm going to let you know. Cautious

710
02:22:06,631 --> 02:22:12,497
yeah just pulled a stupid him out how about
how about you we got to eat you

711

yeah it's a funny Mario

712
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:27,859
my closed captioning are freaking the fuck
out right now they have no idea what I just
said okay

713
02:22:31,184 --> 02:22:59,712
make a plug there is now full closed
captioning support Sonora TX Rob thanks for
the OBS plug-in if you'd like to know more
there's a YouTube videos you can watch how
to set up for yourself does not work with
streamelements by the way which is kind of
interesting because most of us which uses
streamelements for Tobias and in that
specific case they're fact because they
can't add it was closed captioning but we
can because we use Linux

714
02:22:59,715 --> 02:23:02,331
so there aren't back to what we were doing

715
02:23:03,812 --> 02:23:11,223
weight is a white ansible I could have named
that that made the closed captioning rat
with a compiler

716
02:23:14,116 --> 02:23:21,210
yeah me too I like that a lot and he's a
good job to buy me

717
02:23:22,019 --> 02:23:37,512
IR doesn't work under $0.04 no it does not
but in reality it doesn't work 100% but it's
better than nothing particularly if you
can't turn on sound and if I make sure to be
Chloe and to enunciate

718
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:42,222
I said I said Chloe insteadChloe instead of
slowly

719
02:23:46,052 --> 02:23:50,334
I am a horrible speaker II munch on words
all the time

720
02:23:55,174 --> 02:23:56,515
all right

721
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:13,035
at what are we doing out here we go

722
02:24:16,525 --> 02:24:29,020
kravers machine somehow I don't give a fuk I
can't create a virtual machine used to live
because his doesn't work how can I create a
virtual machine using chemo and stead of
liver

723
02:24:30,092 --> 02:24:31,640
I might try that

724
02:24:36,815 --> 02:24:38,465
I am going to try that

725
02:24:45,395 --> 02:24:48,333
touch build I do this all the time

726
02:24:53,052 --> 02:25:00,775
create a ritual machine he's in chemo
directly

727
02:25:04,519 --> 02:25:12,099
yeah he must have been an extensive command
line I'm game

728
02:25:14,667 --> 02:25:20,480
I can't use the bird cuz Leppard sucks Brit
manager fails me constantly

729
02:25:21,171 --> 02:25:23,754
Arabian unless you had they gave him driver

730
02:25:32,639 --> 02:25:38,468
are you saying that if I didn't use liver
it's going to use is going to use the KVM
directly instead of chemo

731
02:25:41,022 --> 02:25:43,635
hi Liza seem bad to me

732
02:25:44,197 --> 02:25:51,312
well I don't know I have no nothing to go on
so how do I create

733
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:58,155
all right yeah are you talking to me

734
02:25:59,463 --> 02:26:01,348
my wife's talking to me

735
02:26:10,572 --> 02:26:13,434
yeah this is it this is definitely a toy
appointment

736
02:26:16,997 --> 02:26:22,711
keep moving all right. Are you kidding me
that's it I didn't look right

737
02:26:25,217 --> 02:26:29,711
bad Mateo as soon as this one say

738
02:26:29,711 --> 02:26:34,618
so I meant your credit is so you have to
install chemo KVM

739
02:26:36,218 --> 02:26:41,196
human create is it shame on caregiver

740
02:26:46,113 --> 02:26:53,362
to be able to escape him directly yeah it's
what I want to do I want to bypass liver cuz
it's all fucked up right now

741
02:26:54,001 --> 02:26:56,935
always return appointment

742
02:27:04,332 --> 02:27:08,656
I do have a Home Server yeah but right now
I'm doing on this system this machine

743
02:27:08,902 --> 02:27:16,440
ffq Cal just finished ucal 5u

744
02:27:16,492 --> 02:27:24,822
is a great of the cicada file I said so I
can write and solve a system in the system
as you want my sandwich woo

745
02:27:24,822 --> 02:27:30,683
August 6th this sucks I just I'm going to
follow this my father's tutorial

746
02:27:33,182 --> 02:27:44,837
hello my dear

02:28:37,964 --> 02:28:41,671
at the moment got to be we went down the
rabbit hole with KVM

755
02:28:43,292 --> 02:28:46,963
yep went down as you drive home with kabian

756
02:28:47,243 --> 02:28:51,506
and chemo and liver and how they all relate
to one another

757
02:28:52,042 --> 02:28:58,495

760
02:29:16,879 --> 02:29:23,616

good old Arch

772
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:26,391
yeah I don't know man this is supposed to be
the ansible I am seriously tempted to just
use live VM virtualbox on here because I
haven't already here and come back to this
later so I can get some some understanding
of it we're like pushing time here here for
support and lvm graph

773
02:31:27,795 --> 02:31:36,249
I kind of want to do this but you know what
I'm going to make a Command Decision and
we're going to

774
02:31:36,745 --> 02:31:40,850
we're going to we're going to not do that

775
02:31:47,683 --> 02:31:53,485
I'm going to keep my sea life nice thank you
for that

776
02:31:58,796 --> 02:32:02,621
I just want a mufuckin virtual machine
that's it

777
02:32:10,187 --> 02:32:21,444
but I'm really trying hard to just keep
feeding to do this Linux way I really am I'm
trying hard to not did not sell out and you
know use these Oracle software

778
02:32:21,445 --> 02:32:31,840
how many tables is already went to Clyde
images of skill new hires yes I want to go
to the next ktvm to make running a bunch of
them easier to plant images

779
02:32:32,391 --> 02:32:49,768
SMS reminder platforms yes yes dinner was
released yes minimal images when we went to
images yes they got rid of this apartment
anymore I heard like up someone's got to
stop supporting minimal they have the
Cardinals been up many many more

780
02:33:03,289 --> 02:33:10,644
so Elsa got the daily

781
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:16,224
give me some what to do with the IMG file
which is raw which is a chemo cute cow image

782
02:33:17,326 --> 02:33:22,179
see there it is right there how long did it
take us to get an answer yesterday

783
02:33:22,805 --> 02:33:25,738
how long did it take us to get to the answer
yesterday

784
02:33:26,367 --> 02:33:32,674
because the file said it was a cuckoo maran
to me like why is it named Donna mg and
confusing the shit everybody because it's
not raw

785
02:33:33,776 --> 02:33:40,926
I mean that was a fucking big deal that was
a big deal that is like super annoying

786
02:33:44,341 --> 02:33:50,617
oh my God okay this is great is a great
tutorial

787
02:33:52,715 --> 02:33:57,813
greater than becoming an answer by yes I
agree

788
02:33:58,008 --> 02:34:00,901
future Harris or cancellation images

789
02:34:02,852 --> 02:34:11,299
which I think I already just downloaded I
already I have it Monday but I'm doing just
as soon as that man has found that list of
packages ya got you

790
02:34:13,109 --> 02:34:19,165
maybe Wade we have to download the key when
files and said the ISO files right

791
02:34:20,482 --> 02:34:30,861
chemo users who want to download the IMG
files okay so I don't have the right thing I
was going to use I was going to use the
Linux Mint I was going to see if you could
do then

792
02:34:31,387 --> 02:34:53,360
and I don't think Linux Mint has an empty
file to use chemo with Isis and I am G's
argument Carrick house I guess I must be
able to ever has already been doesn't know
what does not is there is a man of his
father packages about the loan snaps can
bite me images for twin sister lost in the
cloud appointment cloud in it

793
02:34:53,362 --> 02:35:00,345
I want to do that Nevada sources no don't do
that

794
02:35:00,665 --> 02:35:03,362
his birthday yesterday.

795
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:10,525
I didn't I didn't see if I have snow or
whatever y'all for the command

796
02:35:12,532 --> 02:35:19,401
if I probably can use to boot a C B virus
and an open source bios invitation

797
02:35:19,402 --> 02:35:26,004
well that was a problem before it came up
with rock you count to is it was was raw
yeah I know

798
02:35:26,005 --> 02:36:02,263
yeah but look we don't want to talk about
that because I m g why is it I am Gianna and
then why isn't nakyuka I'm going to named it
wrong and screw this up because we were
trying to confuse a convert the IMG image
into a kick out to image and it was already
if you count and I didn't trust file the
report the right thing which turned out it
was so if I'll come in and so this is kind
of the problem you're having me for a 24
hour on that shit trying to trying to give
trying to look at the Oak Winery in the
button just try to figure out what the
fucking file was

799
02:36:02,267 --> 02:36:12,004
the firmware with kiwis to boot setting
things is to send me Lisa's using a carriage
return a long I had to make a deal with that

800
02:36:22,470 --> 02:36:26,032
but this is only for the cloud-based images
right

801
02:36:26,822 --> 02:36:31,520
I think it's only for the cloud-based images
I'm trying to

802
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:37,235
I know this is stupid and it's not normal
but I won't ask you to boot a desktop image

803
02:36:37,237 --> 02:36:42,293
and that's a Starbucks kind of thing to do I
get it or vagrant or whatever

804
02:36:42,295 --> 02:36:45,681
as it matures now a load-bearing bug

805
02:36:48,284 --> 02:36:54,317
yeah it is yeah it is it really is

806
02:36:54,693 --> 02:37:01,494
well now we know about it right away so SSH

807
02:37:01,968 --> 02:37:07,995
I almost got stuff is because we were trying
to use cloud-based images I don't want to
though

808
02:37:08,167 --> 02:37:24,448
give me a system machine that they have the
BIOS to get up we were trying to get our
stuff to do and it wouldn't do it because it
was going to buy a house and so I actually
thought he got something let me know if it
was taken care of for us

809
02:37:26,418 --> 02:37:30,643
is there a Staples KVM type of Q35

810
02:37:31,206 --> 02:37:37,461
but I'm not at PCI NFL week 10

811
02:37:37,461 --> 02:37:41,129
actually the whole team of command like yeah
it does but it'shusband is also fucked

812
02:37:43,502 --> 02:37:48,897
Burt manager is fucked on my machine because
fucking route

813
02:37:49,149 --> 02:37:55,109
so watch imma do it again Universal machine
measure myself

814
02:37:55,493 --> 02:38:04,294
forward going to go find a nice happy then
it's been 64 should work no problem until it
it's a bunch to

815
02:38:05,449 --> 02:38:09,167
we do this again so people can understand
why I'm going through his pain and suffering

816
02:38:09,686 --> 02:38:20,820
I basic stuff here right forward and credit
disc makers of faults. Whatever it's going
to try to build it and liver images right

817
02:38:21,783 --> 02:38:23,858
which is all fine and good

818
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:30,072
when click on customize this

819
02:38:30,573 --> 02:38:37,974
Katie and I just been keeping Rex 84
emulator chipset bios

820
02:38:38,781 --> 02:38:46,316
I didn't exchange that sounds off formation
about two CPUs

821
02:38:46,601 --> 02:38:52,812
can I sit here to Pieology no food options

822
02:38:53,165 --> 02:38:59,236
I'm going to turn it in with many one last
time right now

823
02:39:00,508 --> 02:39:06,462
her desk cancel know we were to do the thing
again

824
02:39:07,606 --> 02:39:10,017
I don't remember what it wasn't your doing

825
02:39:10,858 --> 02:39:19,017
beginning solution is going to fail though
because it can't is a Nexus because it it
created the images route

826
02:39:19,695 --> 02:39:26,539
I fuck this fuck it fuck it in the ass until
you do it

827
02:39:26,709 --> 02:39:30,490
I know I was going to fuck me over if imma
do it anyway

828
02:39:32,669 --> 02:39:38,584
cuz I just want something I can get Shu I
don't care about the file system permissions

829
02:39:40,667 --> 02:39:42,416
cool

830
02:39:43,489 --> 02:39:48,903
likewise immediate volumes is who want only
cinnamon

831
02:39:50,723 --> 02:39:56,181
ethics that give me a second I know I found
the bug for it

832
02:39:56,547 --> 02:40:00,939
your name is Human create raw I know it's
super cool I want to be able to yet

833
02:40:03,541 --> 02:40:05,582
I want to

834
02:40:08,053 --> 02:40:16,125
and I'm not supposed to do this I'm going to
fucking up my lover because I'm doing is
rude but I'm giving a try anyway so there

835
02:40:19,019 --> 02:40:25,878
Android default equals Kimmy system really

836
02:40:26,890 --> 02:40:32,530
haha that is a new trick I have not seen
before

837
02:40:52,919 --> 02:41:00,915
hey lover. I like that trick I hope it works

838
02:41:00,915 --> 02:41:05,334
it's annoying to have to do it but I'm okay
with it

839
02:41:08,134 --> 02:41:10,947
you're right the fault

840
02:41:17,506 --> 02:41:24,332
yeah but pure system is Alexa local I
remember that from terraform

841
02:41:24,332 --> 02:41:28,982
I don't think it will help because we did
this with the telephone stuff but it's worth
a try

842
02:41:30,892 --> 02:41:37,512
Rochelle machine yeah

843
02:41:40,411 --> 02:41:46,978
can I do it wrong your eye

844
02:41:46,978 --> 02:41:52,548
I underscore default thank you very much
human system

845
02:41:53,538 --> 02:42:01,294
I mean it I fucking myself up because I
already ran for it managers route which I
think you got me in trouble in the first
place

846
02:42:02,716 --> 02:42:08,878
I have to restart the video yet sorry
seashell

847
02:42:08,878 --> 02:42:18,447
now I understand Liberty after you explained
it I explained it I understand why that
needs to be restarted so much because it
reads the configuration it doesn't mess with
KVM though

848
02:42:18,451 --> 02:42:20,636
not really anything you could change in the
module

849
02:42:19,073 --> 02:42:27,111
you could change in the module in the KVM
stuff I would think but I don't think much
of their changes except for reboot I can
update to the actual binary

850
02:42:27,422 --> 02:42:34,477
I would think right current manager I mean I
may have missed something but must drive

851
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:41,078
file new virtual machine I would really like
for this to just accepted a false

852
02:42:43,059 --> 02:42:50,791
amantel I don't I just want to be able to
knock this thing out and get it to work

853
02:42:51,619 --> 02:42:58,867
that was so wrong they're unable to every
month you can maybe I need to put in a
different place now

854
02:42:59,450 --> 02:43:06,956
let's try it in a different place let's
change your volume maybe that the giant the
volume thing of work

855
02:43:08,473 --> 02:43:15,500
a soccer move lasers in the liver group yet
any soccer Vehicles over

856
02:43:16,514 --> 02:43:26,544
well I would not know how to do that but
yeah we can we did that before people were
yelling at me because I was running and his
route and so I tried to do all the work to
change it

857
02:43:26,667 --> 02:43:32,457
at this could be for folder permissions so
we just need to do a Devo and let's see one
thing at a time

858
02:43:33,178 --> 02:43:44,390
but I don't see why why can't I use it if
I'm from it let's try this one chunky cuz
this is all new stuff to jump he's giving us
here this is stuff we haven't tried before
so I'm willing to try anything

859
02:43:46,245 --> 02:43:56,255
yeah I would I would much rather use the
default location which is owned by river who
cares it's supposed to be in the same group
as opposed to work that's the whole point of
putting yourself in the liver group

860
02:43:57,058 --> 02:44:04,724
so is in your yes

861
02:44:05,299 --> 02:44:09,312
he's like a real information so you know
exactly the very kind of

862
02:44:13,947 --> 02:44:18,899
is UNIX talking are weaned Away From Ashes
to New so I can drive versus other account

863
02:44:21,007 --> 02:44:24,020
can I sup you overcome by

864
02:44:24,323 --> 02:44:32,056
are you do think this this needs to have it
in in in and see liver that's this is not
yeah I was going to say

865
02:44:32,617 --> 02:44:34,685
I didn't say okay

866
02:44:37,873 --> 02:44:45,325
I'm going to have to write that stuff down
so if that works let me get to work how to
write it down

867
02:44:45,841 --> 02:44:49,584
is there a Red Sea live Birds

868
02:44:55,971 --> 02:45:03,843
Everts the cough if this works my terraform
local provider Liverpool actually work

869
02:45:06,877 --> 02:45:09,049
oh fuck

870
02:45:09,050 --> 02:45:21,986
I'm an idiot one of the ones that we added
this was this was documented in the bug-fix
so I think you're you're I think you're in
the sink with that

871
02:45:23,632 --> 02:45:31,425
Unix socket group and he's like every right
firm

872
02:45:36,243 --> 02:45:43,063
what was that an excerpt from perms

873
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:54,436
yeah I was trying to say that those are two
things I haven't done I just read write and
read only

874
02:45:54,436 --> 02:46:00,539
should you read only as well Amazon

875
02:46:01,979 --> 02:46:09,372
yeah maybe doesn't work. Org I don't know
what I'm doing

876
02:46:09,373 --> 02:46:29,172
I need to dive into all that stuff and I
haven't really do want to do that I feel I
feel a little bit about my my liver and
chemo skills have been kind of hit and miss
you know and fill in the gaps I got tons of
gaps in their I need to come back and do an
exhaustive in alerting session for all that
stuff I just wanted to keep you to work at
first time and I got the mentor to work and
I was kind of Happy

877
02:46:29,175 --> 02:46:32,977
isotonix oh God please no

878
02:46:32,978 --> 02:46:37,925
I don't have a c Lenox we actually check
that we thought that might have been getting
in the way at one point

879
02:46:37,925 --> 02:46:44,463
yeah there's a command you can do this
except when you have a similar next morning
and I forgot I actually wrote down

880
02:46:44,463 --> 02:46:48,913
number tens to work out of the box on the
internet and of course it does

881
02:46:51,392 --> 02:46:58,762
that you know added to the list of things
that make you one of his red hat instead you
know

882
02:46:59,251 --> 02:47:00,510
and if that's true

883
02:46:59,229 --> 02:47:08,894
and if that's true that's a really
substantial objective bullet point about
using redhead for your servers instead of
I'm going to

884
02:47:09,474 --> 02:47:16,592
Deseret Red Hat yeah and so they make sure
it works right that all the ansible Dave's
are also a redhead

885
02:47:17,099 --> 02:47:23,602
yeah right so yeah that does make you wonder

886
02:47:23,932 --> 02:47:39,069
is it make you want to listen let's just
take a moment to think about this okay so
I'm going to do a facial zoom in thing is so
do we use red hat because all the system
operating system changes are coming
including ansible

887
02:47:39,097 --> 02:47:59,089
Ann libert and Camus those are all owned by
red hat so do you go with a server the eagle
with a redhead server like most Enterprises
do not just because of the of the server
support at the Enterprise level or do you go
or do you trust canonical to be able to take
care of that level stuff for you

888
02:48:00,114 --> 02:48:53,767
and our right has got an army of support
Engineers yes and I put it on my Hardware if
it was your own Hardware you use Pandora now
that that's okay that's different right so
now you're talkin about a no talking about a
workstation so and by the way I use Fedora
for 15 years 10 to 15 years at IBM for that
very reason all of our servers were red hat
and I knew how to manage red hat and I
wanted to be proficient with red hat even if
I was pissed at redhead for selling out at a
certain point you have to kind of say that's
the way things are done so I'm I mean this
if this works this is the first substantial
Remy truly substantial bug that exist in
Ubuntu that does not exist in red hat if
that's true I'm going to add it to the list
and if the list gets big enough

889
02:48:53,772 --> 02:49:11,890
bye-bye I want to go by Damian and I'll
start to use red hat because the engineering
team over there is much stronger standards
and that is the reality whether you like it
or not that is the reality that's the new
Lenox reality

890
02:49:12,613 --> 02:49:17,939
So based on that

891
02:49:20,825 --> 02:49:37,049
and it lets us asking it but that's a pretty
a pretty inflaming question here what
company is going to provide better
Enterprise of support canonical for servers
canonical or red hat

892
02:49:37,051 --> 02:49:47,022
what company has the strongest engineering
as a stronger engineering team for providing
Enterprise support for their Linux
distribution red hat or canonical

893
02:49:47,184 --> 02:50:11,294
and I think if you remove all bias and
internal feeling out of it depends on the
product gen2 if you're talking about or talk
about servers I'm thinking about
specifically servers are behind so much as
GDP did they do to be too I didn't realize I
did the new GTB when did they start becoming
involved with GTB

894
02:50:12,941 --> 02:50:19,128
Arch there's no Arch on any Enterprise
server in the world

895
02:50:19,128 --> 02:50:27,089
I'll pay you $10 if you can find a
substantial company running Arch on the
Enterprise server anywhere

896
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:30,122
you can't save a life cuz it's not

897
02:50:34,031 --> 02:50:38,225
black worm I'm not mad

898
02:50:40,421 --> 02:50:45,835
everything about Enterprise server
architecture

899
02:50:47,429 --> 02:50:50,373
I did not know a red hat

900
02:50:51,357 --> 02:50:57,260
what is red I thought she could be was an
independent thing did they take it over

901
02:50:57,307 --> 02:51:04,834
holyshit you've got to be kidding me

902
02:51:05,781 --> 02:51:11,554
they did not take this Susie I love Susie I
use it for a long time

903
02:51:11,555 --> 02:51:27,786
like I had actually has very little
competition in that in that space I agree
that are designed in a way that I disagree
with and have a tendency to do difficult
things that work in I agree I just never
test anything to me I agree

904
02:51:27,788 --> 02:51:37,384
I agree I do not like the architectural
decisions coming out of red hat but the
engineering from Red Hat is stronger

905
02:51:37,385 --> 02:51:40,380
and that is me speaking

906
02:51:39,104 --> 02:51:47,815
is me speaking dispassionately because I
fucking hate red hat but

907
02:51:49,882 --> 02:52:15,929
call Devin to carry at the elves have the
largest numbers, that's absolutely do you do
when people go there if they want to do
anything so if you remember they have a lot
of meteor that develops projects as well
because they can compile their own right

908
02:52:15,931 --> 02:52:17,902
they have a lot of it yam

909
02:52:18,668 --> 02:52:26,953
I think I think I think Jen to until they
can be used as you back from your pretty
face pretty much allows you to inspect
memories anything

910
02:52:27,606 --> 02:52:51,127
funeral dresses that is a very nakroma
switches from Jen to I didn't realize that I
did not realize that did not know that thank
you for that empty inside tell me why as
usual fantastic Community here really strong
container if you're in building or Linux to
show absolutely absolutely it's better than
a real real fast and then following the
instructions

911
02:52:53,298 --> 02:52:57,265
yeah it was inspect memory

912
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:04,738
how the fuck is this a redhead tool my I
don't

913
02:53:05,361 --> 02:53:08,793
GDP predates redhead by years

914
02:53:15,797 --> 02:53:20,763
someone's got to back up that statement at
Red Hat on Stevie or created it

915
02:53:25,578 --> 02:53:30,188
this pays lot of money to work on it really
I was going to say

916
02:53:32,166 --> 02:53:33,691
yeah

917
02:53:37,392 --> 02:53:45,031
so you're saying that redhead is
contributing a lot to the FSF and therefore
they have core contributors the GB tool a
lot of them

918
02:53:47,858 --> 02:53:54,282
that would make sense but to say but to say
that red hat is or owns GTV

919
02:53:56,658 --> 02:54:00,274
they double charge you for I am as much as I
do my God

920
02:54:01,471 --> 02:54:11,495
they don't all need to be they just have so
much influence over because they bought
their their way to the table meaning they
have the Accord ABS in committing to GB

921
02:54:12,211 --> 02:54:17,574
yeah they maintain the new releases so I
didn't really

922
02:54:18,172 --> 02:54:27,806
control points of GDP they have pretty
significant ones that I did not realize that
she this is like really interesting
information I have to have to summarize as
soon as that

923
02:54:28,134 --> 02:54:30,803
red hats

924
02:54:33,947 --> 02:54:39,474
undeniable I'm going to use your word

925
02:54:39,869 --> 02:54:44,566
control points in onyx

926
02:54:50,528 --> 02:54:56,358
Red Hat created systemd

927
02:54:56,905 --> 02:55:00,921
controls GTV

928
02:55:02,205 --> 02:55:10,171
and did they make live vert and chemo

929
02:55:12,918 --> 02:55:19,713
at least only KVM isn't completely
controlled by by Red Hat as well

930
02:55:23,150 --> 02:55:26,007
are you telling me it is

931
02:55:28,686 --> 02:55:31,733
about the company behind

932
02:55:42,766 --> 02:55:44,859
Red Hat

933
02:55:48,644 --> 02:55:51,354
a long time ago

934
02:55:51,589 --> 02:55:58,701
Michelle Minot everybody's been asking that
mostly it's just consistent across the
border

935
02:56:03,545 --> 02:56:11,981
and red hat is pushing hard with openshift

936
02:56:12,092 --> 02:56:18,850
and pod-man see you control control the
cloud

937
02:56:20,197 --> 02:56:23,363
I need a new space as well

938
02:56:24,055 --> 02:56:28,205
as much as you might hate

939
02:56:28,582 --> 02:56:36,303
where they are taking things their control
over the Enterprise Market

940
02:56:38,741 --> 02:56:44,608
is nearly at Monopoly

941
02:56:46,683 --> 02:56:54,330
have proportions especially considering

942
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:57,636
there

943
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:09,778
affiliation with Iron Man and Enterprise
affinity for big

944
02:57:09,969 --> 02:57:22,832
companies with huge contracts that they can
call upon for support and blame when things
don't work

945
02:57:25,686 --> 02:57:31,460
in other words red hat

946
02:57:33,593 --> 02:57:40,198
like it or not is Enterprise Linux

947
02:57:44,188 --> 02:57:46,413
I don't like writing those words

948
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:55,954
oh yeah oh yeah believe me don't even get me
started to send him with something yeah

949
02:57:58,350 --> 02:58:05,039
if you want to work in Lenox or and or
cloud-native

950
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:10,642
any Enterprise

951
02:58:11,018 --> 02:58:16,538
you cannot avoid learning a redhead

952
02:58:19,036 --> 02:58:25,478
even if you use something else on your own

953
02:58:29,338 --> 02:58:35,929
another thing I could be changing my answer
will mess

954
02:58:39,475 --> 02:58:41,715
and ansible

955
02:58:47,788 --> 02:58:51,417
I mean I don't like Friday yet but

956
02:58:52,632 --> 02:59:05,019
he might cancel this around a bunch you
might be authentic sorrow equals none and
Eagles none since this is a local single
server machine

957
02:59:05,584 --> 02:59:06,903
yeah

958
02:59:07,889 --> 02:59:16,301
those are very saranghae Maza here we go
calm down we're going to keep calling and
just accept reality unfortunately

959
02:59:18,602 --> 02:59:20,045
Sao Paulo

960
02:59:29,357 --> 02:59:33,403
Enterprise on a redhead

961
02:59:40,271 --> 02:59:47,414
I had to accept the harsh reality lately

962
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:13,032
all right

963
03:00:15,449 --> 03:00:23,343
Grantsville Python 2.7 can you please tell
me how I can get off if you want something
all right so I'm going to go ahead and post
that

964
03:00:30,848 --> 03:00:36,089
that's what you give me in here I think I
did I cannot believe they got control of GTB

965
03:00:37,372 --> 03:00:44,548
he's at every day for years is there a
little support trying to find Tilly bugs
that's it that's huge

966
03:00:46,384 --> 03:01:00,656
it's happening cuz you know people argue
about distros and shit and you know when do
managers and on YouTube and letting
intervention here we are talking about the
equivalent at a much greater

967
03:00:59,503 --> 03:01:13,756
much greater scope with regard to the
Enterprise who has control of the Enterprise
you know it's a different conversation at
the elemental as in Wild

968
03:01:15,242 --> 03:01:19,483
it's just so much just such a different tone

969
03:01:21,811 --> 03:01:25,162
this is part of my doctor tried it resists
red hell yeah

970
03:01:26,278 --> 03:01:42,187
Christian Ponder and yeah I think I'd rather
buy a note using keep him in the red hat
hatred for going somebody said that's why
they don't support him cover templates and
stuff

971
03:01:44,384 --> 03:01:53,030
that is a key to making your own little
sister of yeah they did actually they did
use KVM we just read about that they
modified kavian

972
03:01:53,737 --> 03:02:01,072
now there's an elevator debugger alternate
Melody beef Virginia Beach that yeah I've
heard about that too

973
03:02:01,455 --> 03:02:07,542
yeah I know dgb's kind of old school who
Shot Ya

974
03:02:08,783 --> 03:02:37,666
I just hate going they built all over she
thought it was somebody said you were the
one who was telling me that they support PVP
samples but they don't fit they don't
support go template for filtering criteria
on. Unplug men like like dr. Trying to
select a specific thing you want to filter
the output you can use going to put us in a
filter method and they don't care what use
PHP template filter for me but they don't
like she's going that's one of my pet peeves
and I was going to try these five men s r
subscript

975
03:02:37,672 --> 03:02:43,776
yeah yeah that was supposed to be thing that
fights already passed it's not even worth
talking about anymore

976
03:02:48,265 --> 03:03:05,638
after a police raid index card and I have
her every kind of b a l a m a great as
Library regular controls yes yeah well I
don't know why he's for new project running
mobile

977
03:03:05,642 --> 03:03:08,209
good job we in the right place

978
03:03:09,624 --> 03:03:16,565
what kind of live and breathe out all day
everyday I'm going to play with her when I'm
not.

979
03:03:19,115 --> 03:03:23,408
Interesting I I just yeah

980
03:03:23,709 --> 03:03:31,825
do I think that's enough motivation for me
to change my default workstation OS to be a
redhead system

981
03:03:32,192 --> 03:03:34,443
I don't know

982
03:03:35,646 --> 03:03:41,394
God knows that they don't put as much
attention to their desktop distributions
over a redhead

983
03:03:41,394 --> 03:03:43,739
they're all about the server over there

984
03:03:46,012 --> 03:04:11,497
I can't see any reason to do that it really
feels like canonical is fulfilling what Mark
shuttleworth said we're going to make desk
but we're going to make Lennox to the
leading desktop distro they never gave a
shit about servers and it to this day it
seems like Chronicle really doesn't give a
shit about servers they don't care. Just the
only reason that a bunch of server became
popular was because people were using it on
their desktop

985
03:04:12,861 --> 03:04:19,532
I am going to run for four years to but if
you do

986
03:04:20,651 --> 03:04:25,610
yes it's the newest to it but if you can

987
03:04:26,357 --> 03:04:33,985
as Liberty change help in the try thank you
for that reminder

988
03:04:34,801 --> 03:04:40,043
system citizenship I did nothing back yet I
mean you went with none later right

989
03:04:40,043 --> 03:04:44,082
I need your help going with none instead of

990
03:04:48,892 --> 03:04:51,634
to fit none here

991
03:04:51,635 --> 03:04:57,594
I got it back I got to go back sorry for
that I should have done it when you said so

992
03:04:57,595 --> 03:05:01,160
yeah I'll talk to you tomorrow

993
03:05:03,051 --> 03:05:10,438
okay that was there and the other one is in
a tree right right

994
03:05:10,439 --> 03:05:19,043
Elizabeth knows what they already thank God
that we read about that from the bug we we
we've probably had the same bug report that
you're pulling that from

995
03:05:19,043 --> 03:05:25,253
any other name so what's a Porsche

996
03:05:25,909 --> 03:05:32,829
ssj3 if your time in tears are worth nothing

997
03:05:32,830 --> 03:05:40,515
I don't know man it's this is a tough one I
can also use DP Mosaic yes yeah I

998
03:05:39,625 --> 03:05:48,643
yeah I mean if they if their virtualization
is that much easier than the virtualization
so I just was working on a cold stuff and I
might be on board with the red hat change

999
03:05:49,615 --> 03:05:54,980
I just was talking let's go yeah we've been
just this is all over you doing all morning

1000
03:05:56,035 --> 03:06:02,502
I know better like yourself as a redhead I
don't know if

1001
03:06:04,111 --> 03:06:11,633
I don't know as it's a call I'm not an
officer found at all so but they got a
better engineering team so

1002
03:06:11,781 --> 03:06:13,057
enough

1003
03:06:13,623 --> 03:06:19,959
I mean if you're the city where you have to
make a decision based on what's best for the
company you got a second to set that shit
aside

1004
03:06:20,349 --> 03:06:22,549
I'll finish it exactly

1005
03:06:23,684 --> 03:06:30,479
the facts are apps yeah I sort of I mean not
all 12 factors

1006
03:06:32,242 --> 03:06:38,589
yeah I'm not a fan of your business what I
haven't been for a while and I support him
for fifteen years and I'll be home in

1007
03:06:42,801 --> 03:06:52,140
yes it's about microservices most I think
you help me do my restore here is Sue to
systemctl

1008
03:06:54,099 --> 03:06:57,181
restart Levert's d

1009
03:06:58,799 --> 03:07:05,055
and what's wrong with that manager is it
running what's rerun it

1010
03:07:07,254 --> 03:07:12,682
Hertz manager if I make a new one

1011
03:07:13,483 --> 03:07:24,989
I'm exciting as it falls on purpose I'm
deliberately losing the default pool size
and I so much I still think I should be okay

1012
03:07:25,106 --> 03:07:33,067
I'm pretty sure chemo or whatever it is is
emulating on top of his son Tommy stop
talking. They should do it

1013
03:07:36,548 --> 03:07:42,233
I'm not going to do anything else that's
going to try it with the defaults note still
in the fridge still no dice

1014
03:07:44,836 --> 03:07:58,936
hey I went use Emax unless you're working a
large code bases on the same computer and
you're never going to work on more than one
computer maybe Deimos to suffer injury and
then case I can cuz you need to be liking
all my systems

1015
03:07:58,936 --> 03:08:02,915
why is the standard editor on all Unique
Systems

1016
03:08:03,150 --> 03:08:14,085
and if I was going to say that the edge and
I'm going to say okay Ed turned into
accidentally eyes the original version of XO
there for the is the standard enter the end

1017
03:08:16,676 --> 03:08:20,638
given that CB formation around the storage

1018
03:08:21,906 --> 03:08:29,918
it will yeah but but she'll make a new
source will I don't do that to write let's
try that now let's try a different one then

1019
03:08:30,187 --> 03:08:37,284
we need to pull the fault right mint

1020
03:08:37,284 --> 03:08:39,541
I toast right

1021
03:08:41,879 --> 03:08:49,895
so I am I think it's okay to have the image
itself be in one of the scera pool locations

1022
03:08:52,139 --> 03:08:57,180
and then to have the new

1023
03:09:03,147 --> 03:09:06,123
I think I think

1024
03:09:07,862 --> 03:09:13,212
horn right Self Storage

1025
03:09:13,213 --> 03:09:52,213
it's Ranger Credit Union between you select
a storage in yeah that's why I'm saying that
was his fault so that was the first time we
did this before and it didn't work for that
was in with all our changes so let's try
that no so I want to say I want a great news
custom storage this time was created in the
default pool which have full access to we
did this before and it made an image as
route and then it couldn't access the image
which is consistent with what the liver
provider into a terrifying was failing on so
yeah so here we go we can say yes I want to
do volume and say yes give me a new volume

1026
03:09:52,218 --> 03:09:58,282
I don't care we'll see when 22404 finish

1027
03:09:58,419 --> 03:10:06,245
arise if you go I didn't do wrong I just
want my two cute cow

1028
03:10:06,246 --> 03:10:13,989
how do you say C Conaway I'm just lucky I
guess Brunswick I already did it

1029
03:10:14,509 --> 03:10:19,055
hold the phone amantel alright so

1030
03:10:20,718 --> 03:10:28,443
actually let's see what this is see this you
see what it did it did the same thing again

1031
03:10:29,305 --> 03:10:36,607
it did exactly the same thing the only this
time I'm going to intervene I'm going to
show them that shit

1032
03:10:43,552 --> 03:10:53,318
so it will feel it's the same thing it's
just fell before I'm free confidence I
didn't know you can look at it before it
does the actual install

1033
03:10:54,155 --> 03:10:55,511
last time

1034
03:10:58,464 --> 03:11:06,324
no it didn't work last time either but will
try but yeah are you ready

1035
03:11:06,761 --> 03:11:17,692
they said the boot menu actually listen to
see it was giving you a passive permission
to see we might we might have a boot issue
later and we had that before because you
have to check with us at the boot menu on
which I didn't do it

1036
03:11:18,752 --> 03:11:23,757
the Finish yes different error

1037
03:11:24,207 --> 03:11:30,273
Driver Auto read only true discard could not
open permissions 9

1038
03:11:31,492 --> 03:11:36,056
cell dinner restaurants

1039
03:11:41,628 --> 03:11:45,610
so everything

1040
03:11:46,214 --> 03:11:53,797
get out of 40 song about I am not a fool get
out of the full although I get it I get it

1041
03:11:57,430 --> 03:12:01,805
this doesn't work because the it gets
recreated

1042
03:12:05,900 --> 03:12:26,427
every mascot I know there's an open Bug
about this and liver is actually showing the
file to its ownership permissions and that's
II again I I kind of left it at the end
there cuz I didn't want to fuck with it
anymore and I'm inclined to do the same
thing here

1043
03:12:27,865 --> 03:12:33,179
I doubt this is going to change anything but
let's ride

1044
03:12:36,203 --> 03:12:44,081
manage sekou game she's going

1045
03:12:45,679 --> 03:12:52,085
horn he's ever known images fine mind can't

1046
03:12:52,221 --> 03:12:54,635
unless I run it is rude

1047
03:12:57,280 --> 03:13:04,934
I actually think if I do

1048
03:13:05,839 --> 03:13:10,478
route manager as root cuz I just want to get
onto the answer will stuff

1049
03:13:10,806 --> 03:13:15,887
I know I'm not supposed to do this I know
that don't bud

1050
03:13:16,473 --> 03:13:19,463
I just wanted to fucking work at this point

1051
03:13:26,318 --> 03:13:38,739
what to do if I think I might have installed
it wrong I need to wipe my OS and do it all
over again it's probably some bug in there
that I'd that's probably my fault I just I'm
tired of it

1052
03:13:40,124 --> 03:13:47,145
liver Community Roofing time you off when we
did that I had to put myself in the liver
group I did that

1053
03:13:47,146 --> 03:13:54,583
yeah but it wasn't enough so

1054
03:13:59,392 --> 03:14:02,918
nope still has that permission even though
it's route

1055
03:14:03,820 --> 03:14:10,887
reminder to drink is Rudy still at the
information is who's the owner of the pool

1056
03:14:15,059 --> 03:14:18,815
and before the fault or the isopropyl

1057
03:14:20,488 --> 03:14:26,232
you ready to be delivered I think you might
be right

1058
03:14:32,232 --> 03:14:36,487
is slivered something it was like yeah

1059
03:14:39,767 --> 03:14:43,469
I stopped you see a bunch of over it

1060
03:14:45,821 --> 03:14:51,650
it's delivered but there's there's another
one besides liver right

1061
03:14:52,894 --> 03:14:59,336
yeah okay but okay I don't remember the
group though there's another group we can do

1062
03:15:00,466 --> 03:15:07,871
so they went to I talked about

1063
03:15:11,862 --> 03:15:17,736
how is it lyric you make a man yeah wait a
Mite did I do it wrong

1064
03:15:22,611 --> 03:15:28,540
but if I did I might have trip lever I can't
remember which one it is

1065
03:15:29,094 --> 03:15:38,271
he just said user to root group delivered so
I that's what I thought I thought we had it
this is another thing that we were playing
with the other day

1066
03:15:38,364 --> 03:15:44,670
so maybe I fucked it up Gmail cough

1068
03:15:56,412 --> 03:16:06,083
Dynamic ownership this is one this is the
one that we had to fix with a liver should
then I'm going to change file ownership to
match the configuration of User Group above

1069
03:16:07,364 --> 03:16:09,713
Yep this is the one

1070
03:16:10,122 --> 03:16:17,705
and we put 20 cuz you wanted to keep it this

before that's what that back and that's
actually say

1071
03:16:17,857 --> 03:16:20,511
I don't want it to be group route

1072
03:16:21,554 --> 03:16:39,072
set your is a group yeah I was going to say
that sit your user root users of faults by
the way and a group to let Bert and that
will put me in the same in the same group
right yeah that's what it is I bet you
that's the fix emissions to fix for
everything

1073
03:16:39,073 --> 03:16:41,433
I bet you that's a fix for everything

1074
03:16:41,676 --> 03:16:49,710
yep all right so now now now now this is a
q., so it is this still get at Liberty

different to I didn't know if it was still
part of that

1076
03:16:57,957 --> 03:17:04,525

03:17:19,789 --> 03:17:26,460
I'm going to remove a bunch of thing because
I wanted to create and one look at the
permissions you know mean

1080
03:17:26,775 --> 03:17:34,461
we wanted to do the right thing here imma
try to run it without Root permissions for
manager

1081
03:17:37,663 --> 03:17:42,921
transient welcome to the pain

1082
03:17:45,786 --> 03:17:53,307
browse this is just the image

1083
03:17:53,399 --> 03:18:00,006
thanks mint ISO I hate having to change this
but whatever

1084
03:18:00,047 --> 03:18:03,569
where 2

1085
03:18:03,741 --> 03:18:11,806
now I kind of want to put it in that
location just cuz

1086
03:18:17,883 --> 03:18:24,618
absolute I don't think I'm restarting it
properly

1087
03:18:24,618 --> 03:19:03,072
I honestly don't think I'm restarting
properly this is and this is where we left
last time and they said you need to restart
your computer to get it to work right now is
like why and everybody was saying because
it's a KVM thing and it's in the colonel and
I was like well that's would mean that the
colonel is being saved differently or
something or that we don't have a clean
install there's a lot of things about me
it's all they got fucked up on the first
time so naughty Katie I miss you that's what
I thought that's that's what I thought so
it's possible that I'm not restarting limber
properly hear it let's let's do this this
thing stopped Lynn Verdi

1088
03:19:04,140 --> 03:19:10,198
but you can still be activated by whatever
status

1089
03:19:11,580 --> 03:19:18,368
Liberty system loaded boom 66

1090
03:19:18,368 --> 03:19:28,175
inactive okay it said Jim 62 stop
personalization Damon's so that means it
would have brought up the name is David has
to run his route right

1091
03:19:29,943 --> 03:19:36,666
and I started back up again so we've been
very explicit by that

1092
03:19:36,666 --> 03:19:41,204
and what do a bunch of we would do a bunch
of fool

1093
03:19:43,083 --> 03:19:48,215
verts a manager make a new one

1094
03:19:50,102 --> 03:19:52,009
new forward

1095
03:19:53,098 --> 03:19:59,966
I didn't say I think I fucked up my install
some now and something about what I have
here is wrong I don't want to waste people's
time

1096
03:20:01,274 --> 03:20:09,122
I am going to fly on a fresh install of
meant for my desktop I might consider going
with Jordan so actually

1097
03:20:09,225 --> 03:20:17,116
because I just use internal anyway so no
problem with that is like it really sloppy
with my apt stuff

1098
03:20:18,163 --> 03:20:32,306
I didn't reboot you wanted me to do that
they wanted me to reboot you're the one who
kept saying that I was like what you're
saying is different than What proportion of
her somebody was saying was I can't remember
but you know it was was a fortunate result

1099
03:20:34,683 --> 03:20:36,411
I can't remember the name

1100
03:20:37,041 --> 03:20:44,104
terraform is an 04 if you're going to use
liver provider because liver is broken on a
bun to

1101
03:20:44,713 --> 03:20:47,342
now I can see our teacher know it's pretty
fun huh

1102
03:20:48,691 --> 03:21:02,228
when is red hat for Roblox to just work out
of the box and require no config changes
what at this point chunky I mean you're
pretty much convincing me to run for Nora's
my desktop go to system because

1103
03:21:02,459 --> 03:21:06,022
but then but then I have to give up things
like Witcher

1104
03:21:08,338 --> 03:21:10,782
so you know

1105
03:21:10,959 --> 03:21:20,486
anyway and suppose not making a witness
trying to get a fucking VM created using
chemo and not happening

1106
03:21:20,969 --> 03:21:32,326
I've gotten anywhere because of the distro
and I got you know so those powerful brains
in the business here hey it worked

1107
03:21:33,075 --> 03:21:38,607
what do we last change we did something it
worked

1108
03:21:40,476 --> 03:21:47,576
it totally worked at time group eagles live
right with a restart

1109
03:21:49,161 --> 03:21:55,489
you think it was real people Albert you know
what else it was oh God

1110
03:21:56,157 --> 03:22:01,572
that's like mint like oh my God it's alive

1111
03:22:02,835 --> 03:22:16,380
all right everybody like fries because I am
I know you're going to hate me but I have to
document what we just did right now if I
don't do it I won't be able to do it again

1112
03:22:16,440 --> 03:22:19,281
we're keeping the tradition of yay

1113
03:22:20,942 --> 03:22:38,479
I believe the one fix that did this is as as
jumpy as been saying and I was wanting to
test last night but I did I gave up is
change the group and also did you notice we
use the default pool location yeah

1114
03:22:38,482 --> 03:22:41,013
veress H list

1115
03:22:43,654 --> 03:22:50,949
was it pool what was that other one. Coolest

1116
03:22:56,890 --> 03:23:02,608
we did is Assisi till stop and start and we
did not do a restart

1117
03:23:02,951 --> 03:23:05,338
alright so

1118
03:23:08,559 --> 03:23:13,316
in short with the socket permissions

1119
03:23:16,262 --> 03:23:22,044
he will start you think all that stuff had
to be there

1120

ohmygod now

1121
03:23:26,181 --> 03:23:33,833
if you think all that had to be there then

1128
03:24:18,704 --> 03:24:25,564
yephuman system group Eagles delivered

1129
03:24:27,742 --> 03:24:34,288
make sure you add your user to the vert

1130
03:24:35,205 --> 03:24:39,878
a group and

1131

log out and log back in

1132
03:24:49,175 --> 03:24:53,343
you'll know because groups

1133
03:24:54,716 --> 03:25:02,624
I will list it and you'll be able to create
vm's using

1134
03:25:03,769 --> 03:25:09,730
virt-manager without

1135
03:25:11,169 --> 03:25:18,869
ramanujan went through it without any other
major changes

1136

1140
03:25:53,656 --> 03:26:03,592
we were trying to use their phone with a
live bird provider and I think we might have
just fix it if we did then we can go back to
try or turn from a local system instead of
using it as a separate thing

1141
03:26:09,016 --> 03:26:15,486
group Eagles liver and when you are in
default equals Kimo system

bunch of stuff in here

1143
03:26:25,811 --> 03:26:27,883

1146
03:26:58,499 --> 03:27:05,765
I don't know if it's I think it's a bunch of
the news that mr. extremely I do I think
it's

1147
03:27:19,097 --> 03:27:25,016
yeah yeah it did it definitely did

1148

yeah I don't know

1151
03:27:49,513 --> 03:28:42,233
I don't know if there's even if it is I know
the terraformed stuff we here's the problem
K I got all the stuff installed invert
Manager work fine I was able to create memes
right and then I tried use TerraFirmaCraft
beams and it couldn't do it and that was
when we hit all of the problems with libvirt
using having tear from try to talk through
the socket and it cuz it says chemo system
as a source in terraformed and I think the
reason it couldn't work is because it was
interacting with liver differently than Bert
manager was by default when it first
installed because I was successfully tell
him I'll tell you I was successfully able to
create virtual machines using Levert manager
as root and no problem and then I got out of
it and I can still do it and it wasn't until
I tried to use her phone to do it where I
set the provider as chemo system that it
started having a big problem a while

1152
03:28:42,241 --> 03:28:49,227
thank you for that and so

1153
03:28:49,967 --> 03:28:52,719

going to try terraform again tonight in fact
I might try it

1163
03:30:48,088 --> 03:31:14,916
as as as maluma said it is so much more
important for us to learn how Linux virtual
machine to work then to get ansible to work
so I don't mind going down the travel base
especially since we have people that are
Colonel Deb's in the audience are helping us
out like chunky yeah I must be of couldn't
yet that's going to stop me

1164

1185
03:34:08,210 --> 03:34:13,199

1191
03:34:59,801 --> 03:35:06,646

1192
03:35:09,743 --> 03:35:14,876
circular saw at the fault

1193
03:35:17,452 --> 03:35:19,724
yeah I mean it's a bunch of stuff here

1194
03:35:21,328 --> 03:35:26,984
how do you make a tag system is that that's
a big question

1195
03:35:27,312 --> 03:35:34,183
I mean you can go read and all the stuff I
read about that he was trying to learn about
cybersecurity

1196
03:35:34,792 --> 03:35:37,331

03:36:00,660 --> 03:36:07,695
and I'm going to put that big ol anthesis on
this morning

1201
03:36:44,241 --> 03:36:45,960
all right

1202
03:36:53,903 --> 03:37:01,094
Hitman working Nash CD-ROM for ISO

1203
03:37:02,222 --> 03:37:11,171
and provide a disc you have him sell it to
do it directly very very cool you got to
work hey fresh yeah

1204
03:37:15,001 --> 03:37:22,512
Lenox nice yeah I just I only use Witcher
wish for TF2

1205
03:37:23,970 --> 03:37:31,801
yeah hip I think that's it

1206
03:37:35,332 --> 03:37:42,083
so so there's my notes on that they said
send me the correct if I got it wrong

1207
03:37:45,472 --> 03:37:52,922
so hopefully that will help people that went
out to Twitter everything I'm going to stand
up and take a quick little break

1208
03:38:04,663 --> 03:38:10,350
I need my bladder needs a break if I can

1209
03:43:31,692 --> 03:43:35,939
no I'm at more punctual these days used to
not be at all

1210
03:43:40,741 --> 03:43:43,356
all right

1211
03:43:48,199 --> 03:43:53,160
I went to the break come back now I'm back

1212
03:43:53,580 --> 03:43:58,149
I'm back I need to go to the restroom and
stuff

1213
03:44:03,766 --> 03:44:09,543
yeah I got offered greater I got off work I
think technically yeah I delete the whole
fucking thing

1214
03:44:09,908 --> 03:44:21,585
but my I still have an account over there
for my skills that company and I can't
manage to get an account and so I took it
all the shit from people trying to sell my
me executive services for my company in like

1215
03:44:22,249 --> 03:44:26,771
I I hate Lincoln I wish I had never ever
gotten on it

1216
03:44:31,738 --> 03:44:40,401
so I have a feeling that this rabbit hole
with doing chemo directly is unnecessary at
least for now so we'll do it later

1217
03:44:41,060 --> 03:44:43,277
assistant search

1218
03:44:43,744 --> 03:44:53,872
this is somehow to search work it works like
this said query ansible and I use get him
for the searching

1219
03:44:53,873 --> 03:44:57,663
I cheat that's how

1220
03:44:59,203 --> 03:45:05,130
and then I have my own internal thing him

1221
03:45:06,582 --> 03:45:13,748
Cindy said in an easy fix it it's got
problems but him

1222
03:45:13,748 --> 03:45:15,882
alright so

1223
03:45:16,759 --> 03:45:25,750
answer the question why ansible instead of
just a bunch of shells for a reason that I
already did that I need to write about
anymore if you don't know why

1224
03:45:25,752 --> 03:45:40,271
the short answer the tldr is because that's
what everybody uses to configure systems.
It's modular and it lets you do stuff that
just works cute little kids

1225
03:45:40,273 --> 03:45:47,080
yeah Nicki Minaj it's no video chat with you

1226
03:45:47,081 --> 03:45:55,368
okay so great a virtual machine somehow
trifling you presently using

1227
03:45:57,421 --> 03:46:04,336
virt-manager here on Linux you're on Linux
it doesn't matter as long as you get at this
age

1228
03:46:04,587 --> 03:46:08,982
Sophie finally figured that step 5 hours
later

1229
03:46:10,234 --> 03:46:13,973
and also few things to put away such as
yourself package got files

1230
03:46:17,078 --> 03:46:21,595
would you advise your car identification
with a new system this is crude this is
trivia

1231
03:46:24,308 --> 03:47:03,686
Universal machine is in Cuba directly no
fuck that fact you can die I don't need you
anymore I don't need you anymore because why
I have this Halo people I have a Linux Mint
system ye now it's just is Anthony the whole
school install here I'm going to go ahead
and go for it so if if you don't know how to
do this stuff just go ahead and install look
for any of the information I have allowed on
how to install Kimu and which at the time I
didn't realize was a bigger than that it's
also install liver manager and

1232
03:47:04,312 --> 03:47:10,548
that was based on another sheet or else you
got to find out actually I think I have a
lab on it

1233
03:47:11,432 --> 03:47:14,290
that find

1234
03:47:14,793 --> 03:47:20,536
chemo so I mean cuz I don't want to leave
people to watch it right now. How did you
get that on there

1235
03:47:20,886 --> 03:47:32,426
set up Kim over some machine on Linux so
this is the one said chat this one so that
that one has the instructions about

1236
03:47:34,566 --> 03:47:42,990
about that so sexy lab came to set up did I
actually type it that way please tell me I
didn't God damn it

1237
03:47:43,802 --> 03:47:47,066
if it's that way I'm going to be really
embarrassed

1238
03:47:50,492 --> 03:47:57,538
and God good the link is broken things I got
to do just the link and that

1239
03:48:00,837 --> 03:48:16,923
all right so that that that corrected it
that's another reason not to use of water
because it's so you know he can fix it on
the Fly and it just gets fixed I'm actually
let's go for it we're going to sell mint on
this computer

1240
03:48:17,597 --> 03:48:24,012
an English Rose makes me happy I just say
this makes me so happy I'm like

1241
03:48:24,013 --> 03:48:26,732
reminded how much I love mint

1242
03:48:31,003 --> 03:48:34,046
English to English

1243
03:48:34,047 --> 03:48:39,946
continue I don't like I'm sitting at all
it's to cover fighter login

1244
03:48:40,054 --> 03:48:49,708
yeah I fucking hate it but I do know that it
works with the phone and that's the part
that we get suppose people in this way they
use it which I eventually want to work out

1245
03:48:49,709 --> 03:49:00,119
it's almost half a multimedia codex I don't
really need them but if you want to be able
to play stuff you probably need it that's
proprietary that's why they asked you that

1246
03:49:01,053 --> 03:49:04,603
so you can do dcma kind of stuff

1247
03:49:08,791 --> 03:49:26,825
erased is going to sell a smooth again this
is not going to be your coldest it'll be
just a disc for this computer this virtual
machine something else no I don't want to do
my own thing I love meant I just really
really love it just saw your key for file
system on a virtual disk

1248
03:49:28,433 --> 03:49:37,639
yeah the one thing I'm still missing from
his other cast in his I can't use it with my
phone remotely that's a big big deal

1249
03:49:37,640 --> 03:49:43,176
so I need to fix that it's one of the many
things I love actually had robbed

1250
03:49:44,271 --> 03:49:51,524
let's call it VM

1251
03:49:51,565 --> 03:49:58,248
I meant Rob Senate SSH has two different
username password password

1252
03:49:58,449 --> 03:50:05,548
I think login automatically sure

1253
03:50:06,152 --> 03:50:11,017
now we're kind of password no I'll get it
back Lee

1254
03:50:11,017 --> 03:50:21,093
come home folder and now I mean these are
all I say is a workstation normally I would
do a server for this stuff but why not you
know

1255
03:50:23,237 --> 03:50:28,940
I can give you in have a good deal no
urgency also no

1256
03:50:28,943 --> 03:50:31,293
I don't think it would

1257
03:50:31,296 --> 03:50:37,844
you know anything or see first without any
cplusplus

1258
03:50:37,844 --> 03:50:40,802
they're totally different languages they
might

1259
03:50:39,607 --> 03:50:50,137
they might be competitive plus plus might
allow you to write see but if you write C
and C plus plus many people would say you're
doing it wrong at no more than me including
Striker

1260
03:50:50,471 --> 03:50:59,003
go talk to some of the sheep was supposed to
be a totally different language thinking of
them as the same language is a huge mistake
in my opinion

1261
03:50:59,665 --> 03:51:08,467
supposed to be friends for starters and see
is imperative and sometimes functional
that's the first big difference

1262
03:51:10,206 --> 03:51:15,762
they put that in job postings because they
don't know better

1263
03:51:21,986 --> 03:51:26,979
I am calling you on that junkie I am totally
quoting you

1264
03:51:30,041 --> 03:51:36,495
that is so late getting a quote quote

1265
03:51:40,523 --> 03:51:57,084
that's funny

1266
03:52:08,189 --> 03:52:09,628
adem

1267
03:52:20,360 --> 03:52:25,646
alright procedural imperative same thing

1268
03:52:25,839 --> 03:52:31,720
imperative and procedural are closely
related she can be functional as well

1269
03:52:32,996 --> 03:52:40,800
and if she has procedural or or or
functional medicine imperative language is
like if this then that

1270
03:52:41,210 --> 03:52:47,063
I tend to me imperative is the opposite of
body of reprogramming it's like this that
easiest way to say

1271
03:52:47,531 --> 03:52:57,325
yeah there's a little bit of overlap in your
Paradigm specifications are I think I can
have that wrong but can I ask why I was
going to use the right for everything

1272
03:52:57,446 --> 03:53:02,488
I didn't Auntie monks I thought it is for
everything

1273
03:53:02,488 --> 03:53:06,108
as I'm making a power call Jala calling

1274
03:53:09,784 --> 03:53:23,796
geek jokes that make me laugh times a day or
even a week that I would actually belly
laugh

1275
03:53:24,177 --> 03:53:36,942
since I started screaming I might get really
upset and need to pet masi to get my some my
blood pressure down and stuff like that but
I want to tell you since live streaming and
meeting is

1276
03:53:36,945 --> 03:53:56,283
band of Misfits I have belly laughed more
than I've ever been laughed in my life
because you're so fucking funny your jokes
just make me laugh so it is hard to find
people that actually make me laugh that much
and I really enjoy it so there thank you

1277
03:53:56,433 --> 03:53:59,772
I respect you I really love it

1278
03:54:03,087 --> 03:54:07,456
he said Festival I didn't think we need to
send anymore

1279
03:54:07,456 --> 03:54:14,269
when was Justin about our Tokyo this is a
good one you have but we don't need any more
apparently this one anymore

1280
03:54:17,581 --> 03:54:25,704
how does tax search work it doesn't text her
she wasn't working right now it only work it
only serves just had her in mind

1281
03:54:25,705 --> 03:54:33,877
unless you can get him then today searches
the whole body text continue testing restart
now

1282
03:54:33,877 --> 03:54:39,443
damn that was fast that was fast

1283
03:54:39,444 --> 03:54:45,112
why do I get the feeling that this is going
to be a lot faster overall then running
virtualbox

1284
03:54:46,163 --> 03:54:51,729
I mean that's that's my press removed
insulation in the front center

1285
03:54:53,732 --> 03:54:57,652
it's going to see the installation media
again I have a feeling

1286
03:54:57,652 --> 03:55:04,072
yeah because he knows that the volume I
might have to go on Mount the volume in
route manager

1287
03:55:04,072 --> 03:55:08,936
I think which I don't know how to do all
thing to learn how to do that if that's true

1288
03:55:10,809 --> 03:55:15,310
even it even uses the same sound drivers and
blue everybody's ears out

1289
03:55:16,109 --> 03:55:18,940
where was actually learning at school today
and work nice

1290
03:55:19,952 --> 03:55:30,865
well we're getting very close your system is
currently running without video Hardware
acceleration he may experience for
performance so nice if you shouldn't I don't
plan on using Graphics at all

1291
03:55:34,486 --> 03:55:36,690
I wonder if they're

1292
03:55:39,869 --> 03:55:51,240
I wonder if there's actually drivers for
this this is where we would start playing
around with pastor and stuff like that which
is not critical to what I want to do today
but at some point when I come back and do
that

1293
03:55:52,285 --> 03:55:58,033
does not need any additional drivers you
think so huh I mean it's pretty damn fast

1294
03:55:58,674 --> 03:56:03,921
I feel like I'm going to play like a game
from hers and I could probably try it though
watch me break it

1295
03:56:05,711 --> 03:56:10,979
I should have died so I don't know very
usable

1296
03:56:17,749 --> 03:56:19,222
sound

1297
03:56:20,918 --> 03:56:26,401
I'm just trying to see in the desktop
environment

1298
03:56:26,908 --> 03:56:33,312
if I'm going to be able to do it or not hey
look my fault

1299
03:56:33,564 --> 03:56:40,527
super ugly terminal the running Linux inside
of Linux running mint

1300
03:56:40,527 --> 03:56:46,508
inside a populist right now we're running
mint inside a populist

1301
03:56:47,373 --> 03:56:53,625
just cuz we want to I think about this as I
can show people how to set up their servers
and stuff

1302
03:56:57,991 --> 03:57:02,964
we've been interested in a decision around
here at so I can do ansible for it

1303
03:57:03,777 --> 03:57:09,394
I think open a stationary installed I'm
going to do it from the command line

1304
03:57:13,134 --> 03:57:20,781
Jenny told her I don't even know that I need
a full graphic enable VM

1305
03:57:22,050 --> 03:57:26,888
it doesn't do my default yeah I remember
that

1306
03:57:27,411 --> 03:57:33,898
yeah so if I try to connect to here's my IP
right

1307
03:57:34,672 --> 03:57:42,509
I over here and I at the sage to it oh God

1308
03:57:44,893 --> 03:57:52,622
God damn it that's right I forgot cut and
paste doesn't work yeah I forgot about that

1309
03:57:53,212 --> 03:58:00,390
always on top and Sage

1310
03:58:01,313 --> 03:58:05,329
6/8. 22. 101

1311
03:58:08,501 --> 03:58:13,129
I know you have something at work there's no
SSH though

1312
03:58:13,130 --> 03:58:19,851
yep there's no Staples Center to work
station right so it doesn't have it but what
if I don't have to install it

1313
03:58:20,749 --> 03:58:25,900
apt install openssh-server I think

1314
03:58:25,949 --> 03:58:30,220
hi how's it going it's your grandma

1315
03:58:31,609 --> 03:58:37,845
we're installing openssh so true or false
when using

1316
03:58:37,846 --> 03:58:42,428
ansible you must have SSH configure

1317
03:58:45,462 --> 03:58:49,966
so it

1318
03:58:54,229 --> 03:59:13,878
and this using one of them I don't even know
they had how's it going I did not know what
when our m is a remote to a dossier on any
system in order to get to work so so what so
let's say

1319
03:59:13,880 --> 03:59:19,287
Melissa's the current system password

1320
03:59:19,395 --> 03:59:27,192
now I'm going to do a thing a magical thing
with SSH y'all probably know this right

1321
03:59:27,193 --> 03:59:33,174
copy ID this will actually make it so I
don't have the password ever again

1322
03:59:33,174 --> 03:59:36,282
for better or worse

1323
03:59:42,498 --> 03:59:47,112
and then I can do it again I just get on
there

1324
03:59:47,112 --> 03:59:58,905
you need the IP is going to be the same
every time I boot up pretty sure that's
consistent sure so I can go

1325
03:59:58,905 --> 04:00:04,578
yepwhat hey how's it going Switzerland

1326
04:00:06,758 --> 04:00:12,474
you probably like everything else when your
horse is falling hosts

1327
04:00:15,251 --> 04:00:23,105
weather in SS in a switches that guarantees
can always be the same interesting

1328
04:00:28,179 --> 04:00:31,447
and please tell me I don't have anything
here that I shouldn't show

1329
04:00:35,055 --> 04:00:39,222
I'm scared SSS

1330
04:00:41,377 --> 04:00:50,512
I see you can sense if you have name and its
relation to what that need any IP you don't
need it right above got you

1331
04:00:51,177 --> 04:00:53,258
find a horse to add it

1332
04:00:57,230 --> 04:01:05,113
you should have had a phone CVS ISO savion's
IP for husbands on my son's name

1333
04:01:06,679 --> 04:01:19,847
I'm going to have Dad mine right you send me
pictures of a new nameservers Switch
functionality yeah they did you let me see.
This new I haven't done is work

1334
04:01:20,912 --> 04:01:25,323
yeah this is cool

1335
04:01:27,323 --> 04:01:29,918
let me see the ad

1336
04:01:34,465 --> 04:01:41,418
lizards I guess is rude yeah okay

1337
04:01:41,663 --> 04:01:48,604
verts s a group right yep limbert

1338

Ojos oh okay I'll try that

1339
04:01:56,079 --> 04:01:58,395
hosts here we go

1340
04:02:00,689 --> 04:02:06,814
not found equals return hose files minimums
Muse my machines

1341
04:02:08,309 --> 04:02:16,011
I rather in your home house

1342
04:02:17,133 --> 04:02:26,905
I know I've heard about it at some point it
will but this is just on my own machine
machine right so host gets when he gets kids

1343
04:02:26,905 --> 04:02:33,999
verts all right I guess I didn't know there
was it was more than that

1344
04:02:34,819 --> 04:02:37,699
Brenda b r t yeah that's cool

1345
04:02:42,842 --> 04:02:45,503
all right love our guest okay

1346
04:02:47,323 --> 04:02:51,728
but let me know how they even know to go to
it

1347
04:02:51,728 --> 04:03:02,553
and we try to oh the name the name may be be
be be be remade I get that with the various
ageless right

1348
04:03:02,554 --> 04:03:08,479
so as his age 12 no completion bud

1349
04:03:11,968 --> 04:03:16,888
there's no I made it wrong device or
resource busy

1350
04:03:21,959 --> 04:03:29,286
is right let me go see if we can find out I
probably have to restart the name service
right I guess I I do

1351
04:03:29,286 --> 04:03:34,285
that came out wrong I'm dying to live

1352
04:03:34,690 --> 04:03:40,863
do I need to donate to put it there all
right fine

1353
04:03:45,486 --> 04:03:50,307
we can't imagine guests stay for some
research and machine

1354
04:03:50,307 --> 04:03:58,781
and sign the modules really easy a maybe I
don't have a no I do have it on and it's
going to take a shower for the Virginia's

1355
04:03:59,059 --> 04:04:06,120
a suspect has been arrested for me looking
for the whole user is trying to get through
files module has consulted

1356
04:04:06,121 --> 04:04:12,054
I can just a lot he also but that's kind of
better for other stuff

1357
04:04:12,055 --> 04:04:17,090
much like the only only host name is
provided by guest

1358
04:04:17,353 --> 04:04:20,579
do you think the hostname goes here

1359
04:04:26,158 --> 04:04:31,269
I think so it's 8 p.m.

1360
04:04:31,729 --> 04:04:38,534
what I don't have r.e.m.

1361
04:04:38,534 --> 04:04:43,185
Vienna by ybn nahmiroh we what you mean the
name

1362
04:04:45,257 --> 04:04:51,860
oh because I needed the hostname VM got you
got you good I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad I'm
glad

1363
04:04:52,249 --> 04:04:57,400
I need the address though but I still needed
to add delivered right

1364
04:05:02,827 --> 04:05:05,653
I need to put that in here

1365
04:05:07,763 --> 04:05:14,531
adding named solution to Kimu

1366
04:05:16,657 --> 04:05:18,144
liverworts

1367
04:05:23,417 --> 04:05:30,051
shein mysterious person busy

1368
04:05:31,361 --> 04:05:38,650
if I try to fix I didn't restart okay fine
go updated while I'm doing other stuff my
updates

1369
04:05:39,453 --> 04:05:41,332
I probably missing something

1370
04:05:42,420 --> 04:05:48,588
yeah yeah I mean we'll find it we'll find it
interesting for me to actually press charges

1371
04:05:51,441 --> 04:05:58,705
but you do need SSH

1372
04:05:59,411 --> 04:06:05,822
oh God atom editor BusyBox

1373
04:06:06,727 --> 04:06:12,302
eBay systemd all dates this could take
forever

1374
04:06:18,034 --> 04:06:25,713
all right so that's up stats updating yeah I
mean it's play with it I think it's worth
playing around with I didn't know it existed
so

1375
04:06:32,529 --> 04:06:36,168
alright so

1376
04:06:41,187 --> 04:06:44,484
it does make me wonder if ansible is going
to want that though

1377
04:06:49,726 --> 04:06:57,024
you know I mean we want these dominions
anyway oh that's a testament to block game

1378
04:07:11,240 --> 04:07:16,029
I'll go back and add more till later I just
had to make a make a reference to

1379
04:07:22,506 --> 04:07:26,416
maybe a limber tree still restart probably
right

1380
04:07:29,216 --> 04:07:32,210
Anniston City Jail

1381
04:07:40,903 --> 04:07:44,068
this resource busy current results p.m.

1382
04:07:47,418 --> 04:07:49,748
oh wait it's still running

1383
04:07:52,586 --> 04:08:00,147
I'm not sure restarting is working they the
truth I got a part of the problem

1384
04:08:15,269 --> 04:08:21,954
so 22 22 22

1385
04:08:24,465 --> 04:08:31,158
and use connection I try to do it when I

1386
04:08:31,964 --> 04:08:34,579
white ass naked pig

1387
04:08:36,626 --> 04:08:42,638
oh I'm tried it we're just right and where
to find them Birds SSH

1388
04:08:42,639 --> 04:08:48,158
and I think it is rebooted it actually so so
that's what happened

1389
04:08:56,100 --> 04:09:01,368
turn off yeah your system is up to date

1390
04:09:01,369 --> 04:09:08,111
reboot a required if you want to switch the
look on there no man this brings back
memories

1391
04:09:08,490 --> 04:09:15,945
that just really see the fox say we shall
find out in a second may god restart this

1392
04:09:15,945 --> 04:09:19,712
Sea-Doo shut down Dash

1393
04:09:23,922 --> 04:09:30,156
I should do that tomorrow but whatever
bershka virsh

1394
04:09:32,095 --> 04:09:38,496
DHCP leases default yay

1395
04:09:39,067 --> 04:09:46,459
hosting VM is have it easy for this yeah
that's what

1396
04:09:48,508 --> 04:09:49,802
yeah

1397
04:09:50,612 --> 04:09:59,232
so so livid that doesn't make any sense to
restart Liberty by restarting the system so
that it grabs the right dfcp least make
sense right

1398
04:10:00,279 --> 04:10:06,531
I see what you're saying yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah

1399
04:10:08,231 --> 04:10:13,845
all right let's go ahead and start this baby
power it on

1400
04:10:18,250 --> 04:10:26,317
I am so happy to have her, she's running old
guy that's allowed did you hear that or did
I do in Terraria

1401
04:10:27,570 --> 04:10:33,420
I guess we don't want to remember to know

1402
04:10:34,040 --> 04:10:37,559
I'm so sorry if I haven't

1403
04:10:39,981 --> 04:10:43,737
it's really loud and I woke up here for your
dog

1404
04:10:47,345 --> 04:10:50,484
damn it spoiled again

1405
04:10:56,601 --> 04:11:01,302
didn't even hear what I needed I think I
need to be right

1406
04:11:11,505 --> 04:11:14,708
I think it is I think it is

1407
04:11:15,936 --> 04:11:24,148
no sound things me too

1408
04:11:24,521 --> 04:11:30,251
I'm actually really impressed that the sound
drivers work

1409
04:11:30,764 --> 04:11:40,466
because too often they don't write like a
virtual boxer VMware or something and they
got better out of it for a long time they
did not work at all

1410
04:11:42,490 --> 04:11:50,878
I mean I'm totally okay just making an SSH
config entry but I kind of want to figure
this out

1411
04:11:51,727 --> 04:11:53,669
so

1412
04:11:53,858 --> 04:12:02,639
I don't need you anymore even though I I
will come back to the chemo install from the
command line at some point I definitely will
I just don't want it for now

1413
04:12:02,977 --> 04:12:06,359
Disney value with you yeah

1414
04:12:08,279 --> 04:12:15,195
well yeah I'm surprised this weekend's
running without killing in a lag or anything
she's doing fine now

1415
04:12:24,736 --> 04:12:32,629
I mean to write we can play around with with
the VM setup or not

1416
04:12:36,396 --> 04:12:43,779
and it says such got called is a
configuration video game server switch
functionally

1417
04:12:43,779 --> 04:12:50,911
if you have do the duck represent info
practice I'll try and flipsy name service
switch

1418
04:12:55,855 --> 04:13:01,093
yes I have hosts

1419
04:13:01,093 --> 04:13:06,684
files the rest let's try that

1420
04:13:10,037 --> 04:13:14,583
yeah I know this might have been worth
getting matched first right

1421
04:13:17,566 --> 04:13:25,034
we have we have a link to that somewhere
Redfin

1422
04:13:26,059 --> 04:13:32,960
LS on it I thought it and then it where is
it

1423
04:13:32,961 --> 04:13:40,546
I know it's let's start with one thing at a
time so live vert

1424
04:13:40,546 --> 04:13:47,799
group Hertz guest start there

1425
04:13:47,799 --> 04:13:53,262
now do you think that's going to need a new
DHCP lease

1426
04:13:57,177 --> 04:14:03,963
the NSS thing I don't know how to restartI
restarted Liberty I thought it was in her
it's not it's in anything

1427
04:14:07,765 --> 04:14:12,063
systemctl

1428
04:14:16,279 --> 04:14:22,257
crap and us and it's look up

1429
04:14:23,386 --> 04:14:29,384
immunization Stanis look up in a teaser
what's a subsystem

1430
04:14:31,972 --> 04:14:38,367
might be a little bit I don't think it's a
computer almost positive name Services I've
never had yet

1431
04:14:39,181 --> 04:14:46,441
it is three of us search that's fantastic
yet

1432
04:14:47,611 --> 04:15:02,494
yeah I have a question for you on some of
that stuff we have you ever been terraformed
to do your own local configuration I need to
go back to it but if you do let me know I'd
love to compare notes

1433
04:15:06,494 --> 04:15:14,109
about to reboot my whole computer just to
restart named Services I will cry like a
little baby because that would mean my dream
of Linux has died

1434
04:15:16,159 --> 04:15:31,978
the best hair for me to ever have you done
everything you said you remember you told me
you paid like five bucks for a cloud space
or Cloud configuration time and stuff I'm
just wondering if you tried it with your
form on with Dropbox or anything local

1435
04:15:35,779 --> 04:15:42,989
hey there's some Rust Asians doing stream
planning and writing in Open Office

1436
04:15:43,627 --> 04:15:45,469
sounds about right

1437
04:15:46,681 --> 04:15:53,169
haven't been terraformed I love you I need
to go to xcp-ng to get around yes

1438
04:15:53,645 --> 04:16:12,164
yeah well that's that's okay yeah we can
compare notes when that comes up I want to
see if I can if I can practice my terraform
skills on a local cluster or even just like
a local remote server that's got multiple
course that's kind of the goal you know

1439
04:16:15,053 --> 04:16:33,932
by the way everybody doesn't know it is like
a kick-ass streamer who who is running a
little professional meet up and all kinds of
stuff hasn't been screaming for one couple
months now 3 months or so and I found had
just wandering around when one evening and
I'm super glad I have so make sure you fall
head

1440
04:16:33,934 --> 04:16:43,868
when it when it comes like virtualization
and things like that it's more than me most
people everybody but but yeah

1441
04:16:44,238 --> 04:16:50,545
I don't know about that cut

1442
04:16:50,545 --> 04:16:54,189
okay if you say so

1443
04:16:55,606 --> 04:17:09,068
do you think your parents ever since I mean
you know there's lots of people here there's
lots of streamers actually they did do this
but it had told him once he was interested
in the same kind of operations that I am

1444
04:17:09,070 --> 04:17:14,529
so what is next we have

1445
04:17:15,302 --> 04:17:23,061
obviously we need to restart in a services
and I don't know which one it is so
restarting

1446
04:17:23,399 --> 04:17:31,104
ins which is probably a fur and is this

1447
04:17:31,104 --> 04:17:34,676
is there a demon I need to restart hey it's
the first hit

1448
04:17:39,367 --> 04:17:57,001
I know you probably don't and if you wipe
keep playing Torres it I have not heard
about YP bind in 20 years that's on my plate
with wifey and all that is so that's what
Yellow Pages that's the old school systems
for DNS

1449
04:17:57,060 --> 04:18:03,391
a senior Bridge what bridge are you talking
about

1450
04:18:03,529 --> 04:18:13,585
ins confound figured you may have nscd
nameservers cash and David running which you
may need to receive this unlikely

1451
04:18:14,565 --> 04:18:29,143
yeah I was trying to get in we already did
it was just keep doing it until it works
that's not the definition of insanity that's
how Unix works

1452
04:18:29,144 --> 04:18:33,583
so that would be a no

1453
04:18:33,584 --> 04:18:40,624
you need to set up a manual bridges that is
the fault of the liver I've no idea what you
just said I know

1454
04:18:40,647 --> 04:18:50,043
I know can she definitely doesn't do that
it's still a fair that's why I'm laughing
because didn't work like that

1455
04:18:50,485 --> 04:19:00,120
right now I'm like I'm losing patience
because it's like we're five hours and I
still haven't done anything with asthma

1456
04:19:01,149 --> 04:19:03,007
does it really work

1457
04:19:07,183 --> 04:19:13,729
is that could that be messing with it
actually that might be messing with it I
have it at SSH config

1458
04:19:14,542 --> 04:19:20,812
is it the same IP please tell me star Play
song is not the same IP I think it is a God

1459
04:19:21,160 --> 04:19:23,722
how would it know to God

1460
04:19:24,832 --> 04:19:40,373
IPA ratebeer but not the right command holy
shit it's 131 again when I give it a
different IP anytime right so I don't want
to depend on the icky

1461
04:19:41,072 --> 04:19:48,204
I actually need to spend time doing this
always against which happy every time so we
don't want that we don't want the face
picture saying like me every time

1462
04:19:49,254 --> 04:19:55,879
I don't know it wasn't

1463
04:19:58,137 --> 04:20:05,448
I think I did wear one this last week but I
don't know if that I know it he also or 1 so

1464
04:20:06,369 --> 04:20:11,246
hey how's it going bro

1465
04:20:15,664 --> 04:20:21,140
I'm doing something wrong you absolutely can
ask a question you don't need to ask a
question to ask a question

1466
04:20:25,831 --> 04:20:29,594
what's shall we look at

1467
04:20:32,314 --> 04:20:38,847
I'm going to go bigger than this yes Center
of your chest it's been awhile but

1468
04:20:40,135 --> 04:20:45,196
yeah maybe some people here know about it
they can help you more than me

1469
04:20:52,530 --> 04:20:56,447
well what is ovh for everyone else

1470
04:20:59,560 --> 04:21:05,625
Chicago no no I thought we had something
else I tell you about the cloud provider

1471
04:21:07,757 --> 04:21:09,979
I don't know about that one

1472
04:21:11,112 --> 04:21:16,769
I thought retirement something else ovh is a
format for

1473
04:21:18,078 --> 04:21:26,136
I want to say configuring sound resources
from a long time ago

1474
04:21:27,240 --> 04:21:36,380
I didn't make Ivy yeah I don't know why I
don't know I don't know why that's not
something I can answer there might be
something here you can

1475
04:21:38,611 --> 04:21:43,780
is your driver DNS yep that's what Imma do

1476
04:21:48,275 --> 04:22:03,678
remember your whole said he was a guest to
be on my feet and feel this way because I.
We didn't know I absolutely know I can do it
because I've done that before I would be
super surprised if not I mean it's this is
this is what I mean you know

1477
04:22:03,816 --> 04:22:07,458
on the verge of doing cuz I know it works

1478
04:22:10,234 --> 04:22:21,897
hey look at that I'm on and it didn't take
any other things to do I'm going to keep
doing that for today I don't I want to I
want to move on I'll come back to the name
stuff later

1479
04:22:30,073 --> 04:22:32,645
is spend

1480
04:22:33,247 --> 04:22:44,232
extra time to get consistent name resolution
to your

1481
04:22:44,304 --> 04:22:51,443
yam IP or not

1482
04:22:51,444 --> 04:22:56,114
I didn't I just sent up an SSH I cheated

1483
04:22:56,114 --> 04:23:05,896
I took the I text and don't know where I
normally would have done it right I just put
it into Sage now every time SSH goes It goes
the right thing

1484
04:23:05,896 --> 04:23:20,940
I think it doesn't respond to call Jim I
know this works cuz I already did this 2
days ago so you just fake file and this is
another way yet another way to resolve those
names when you don't know it

1485
04:23:19,843 --> 04:23:43,934
can I pee and I have a feeling that if I
restart my virtual machine that I'll get a
new ID because the DHCP lease and so it's
not a it's not a good way to do it long term
lunch I might want to have it I don't want
to have to sign it but then again you're
getting into nslookup in the Suffolk times
so I wanted to talk to Basile is what we're
doing now I needed an update but it may have
took a while

1486
04:23:44,195 --> 04:23:51,600
is obviously something needs to restart it's
not taking it I don't know what needs to
restart so

1487
04:23:52,481 --> 04:23:57,584
when do we want to try one last thing do you
really want to

1488
04:23:57,889 --> 04:24:02,275
I can move this to temp for now and

1489
04:24:03,695 --> 04:24:13,103
I don't know how to cook a how do I restart
DNS name services on

1490
04:24:14,009 --> 04:24:20,227
I want to am I need to be installed how do I
restart genius mask

1491
04:24:24,252 --> 04:24:26,689
this is when I said it doesn't need it

1492
04:24:30,317 --> 04:24:36,561
I guess you got to be so rude network
manager it's the network manager

1493
04:24:43,158 --> 04:24:46,545
you really think it's the virtual machine is
going to do that

1494
04:24:52,778 --> 04:24:58,131
yeah we did that already

1495
04:25:03,968 --> 04:25:07,858
it sent us our Bridge For Recess all good

1496
04:25:08,455 --> 04:25:13,460
so when it actually works that they gave

1497
04:25:13,460 --> 04:25:19,047
so let me get my advice or the network
manager I might lose you y'all

1498
04:25:19,047 --> 04:25:23,452
if I like this is a pretty hard hardcore
restart

1499
04:25:30,107 --> 04:25:33,983
and there was already a season-low. Never
cracker

1500
04:25:34,621 --> 04:25:38,704
yeah it does it does raspberry Falls it was
really nice

1501
04:25:39,543 --> 04:25:43,890
network manager you think liver needs a
restart

1502
04:25:45,665 --> 04:25:52,020
I remember restarting network manager for
different things

1503
04:25:52,094 --> 04:25:59,135
is it be fully off restart Levert between
that would mean

1504
04:25:59,255 --> 04:26:03,100
hey if that works and that means liver

1505
04:26:05,627 --> 04:26:20,377
so I have a question is are the Network
Services reconfiguring associated with liver
directly or are they generally just on the
system anything on the system has resolution

SSH config cuz I move did so

1535
04:30:11,919 --> 04:30:17,486
here's what we learned software doesn't work
until you install it

1536
04:30:19,886 --> 04:30:27,426
put that that is a clip that definitely
needs a clip

1537
04:30:37,618 --> 04:30:42,529
oh I would have known that I did not alright
so

1538
04:30:44,079 --> 04:30:48,935
we was this now that's like something we did
long ago

1539
04:30:49,019 --> 04:30:55,655
have you tried installing it I should have
been but it wasn't cell

1540
04:30:55,655 --> 04:30:57,800
so there we are

1541
04:31:03,743 --> 04:31:14,824
. I'm kind of happy we got it to work though
cuz I feel I feel like we Master Did We Beat
It we beat it or yes

1542
04:31:16,900 --> 04:31:23,192
take me to money thank you for that I
appreciate it

1543
04:31:23,192 --> 04:31:25,037
install

1544
04:31:27,028 --> 04:31:34,491
software app to do at insult words. We got
lots

1545
04:31:35,016 --> 04:31:40,315
that's fine Samurai

1546
04:31:42,712 --> 04:31:48,682
there we go I'm super excited I like new
software

1547
04:31:48,683 --> 04:31:56,197
I have one whole thing running oh my God
it's so exciting

1548
04:31:56,197 --> 04:32:01,948
HD 25% memory points are 1% of see if you
can't Dam

1549
04:32:01,950 --> 04:32:07,304
this is when Isis tells you whether your
over-provisioning is going to kill you or
not

1550
04:32:07,305 --> 04:32:14,219
I am like that that is a great idea thank
you for sharing that thank you for sharing
that

1551
04:32:14,219 --> 04:32:21,862
thank you very much Lee very quickly
approaching the step where we install and
use ansible

1552
04:32:21,862 --> 04:32:27,712
having streamed for 4 hours and 32 minutes
and 24 seconds

1553
04:32:27,805 --> 04:32:34,721
reduction instead of install ansible but I
mean come on

1554
04:32:34,722 --> 04:32:39,435
it just works now it's a 6 p.m.

1555
04:32:40,516 --> 04:32:46,742
I was like really really amazing now I
really do

1556
04:32:47,586 --> 04:32:57,993
is that as you're in a switch look now mr.
extremely just for the sake of science would
you probably put it back to where it was
before when you think

1557
04:33:00,590 --> 04:33:21,127
unforgiving racial that we did we I do not
regret for one second please do not
misunderstand I am totally happy doing what
we did I feel like I'm a little sad I think
it was something much more valuable than
certain that ain't going as well I am kind
of curious though what happens if I put
these over here

1558
04:33:21,129 --> 04:33:26,588
I don't I don't know would be really
surprised if this makes a difference but I
kind of want to try it

1559
04:33:27,949 --> 04:33:32,219
and I don't know if I had to restart my
machine or not I didn't look like I did
before

1560
04:33:32,592 --> 04:33:48,326
is it okay to compare what we have to do
before yeah so there's nothing to really
restart there so it's this HPM we are there
cat dammit box in fast. Fast that it is such
a fast login

1561
04:33:48,568 --> 04:33:54,883
I approve I approved after that

1562
04:33:55,272 --> 04:34:01,889
next we're on to next isolationist

1563
04:34:04,992 --> 04:34:06,855
read me

1564
04:34:10,168 --> 04:34:17,893
it's the same it's just the order and I
think you're a baby cute Irish it's easy I
always have

1565
04:34:18,145 --> 04:34:25,882
I teach people to use a colon do you keep
his reliable everywhere but she's used
faster to type so

1566
04:34:26,302 --> 04:34:30,315
yeah that's that's why you don't see me as
much

1567
04:34:34,903 --> 04:34:45,924
yeah I'm still really locked into a control
up bracket for my Skype instead of my remote
cats walk but my fingers don't remember it
I've been using shift lever bracket for
years

1568
04:34:45,926 --> 04:34:53,431
which works on everything you don't you
don't have to fuck around with them or see
something

1569
04:34:54,710 --> 04:35:09,772
what what what what what are we doing we're
installing animal they even have it how do I
install and civil I need to find an exit or
I think we have one here

1570
04:35:10,592 --> 04:35:15,091
7 Q in a bun two went to see how I actually

1571
04:35:18,703 --> 04:35:24,581
I'm going to smoothies sue me

1572
04:35:26,229 --> 04:35:32,474
they don't belong there this is ansible this
is not chemo so

1573
04:35:37,803 --> 04:35:45,194
permit me if I didn't spend time to document
this stuff I would be

1574
04:35:46,155 --> 04:35:52,941
unable to repeat it so Kingdom Hearts Wiki

1575
04:35:54,293 --> 04:36:01,007
as all of my resources for chemo that I've
used in the past

1576
04:36:01,687 --> 04:36:09,670
that's what I have already got a couple
times all right let me say that

1577
04:36:10,791 --> 04:36:17,451
Renee add more

1578
04:36:18,380 --> 04:36:25,859
reading resources enforce I don't think I
tagged this snow

1579
04:36:25,859 --> 04:36:33,008
alright thank you for permitting me to do
that ansible Playbook

1580
04:36:33,091 --> 04:36:40,416
yep okie dokie

1581
04:36:40,416 --> 04:36:47,883
installing ansible I'm adding it to my
related section

1582
04:36:53,605 --> 04:36:58,296
oh my God oh my God

1583
04:37:00,467 --> 04:37:07,959
is there an update hey you know what people
we're going to have to write our own
installer for ansible

1584
04:37:10,223 --> 04:37:13,963
anybody knows me knows that I'm talking
about

1585
04:37:19,273 --> 04:37:24,627
God dammit I know we have a few pee in here
somewhere

1586
04:37:27,594 --> 04:37:28,759
yeah

1587
04:37:42,785 --> 04:37:50,467
Minecraft apps let's do helm

1588
04:37:55,796 --> 04:38:03,182
there is coffee install terraform install
ansible

1589
04:38:05,840 --> 04:38:12,545
admin associate it's a prereq where is where
is Edmund Associates

1590
04:38:14,679 --> 04:38:32,306
I thought it was a great communities is the
standard de facto but we hate him 10 plus is
that correct I don't like him that puts you
can't avoid them a lot of times yes but I do
still have to understand Helm Helm is still
required to get the the ccat it's on the
test now

1591
04:38:32,773 --> 04:38:37,680
so you have to learn it I just don't like it
they have to

1592
04:38:38,336 --> 04:38:42,875
and some all right so here's

1593
04:38:43,678 --> 04:38:47,968
I'm going to keep this around cuz it's old
stuff that might be relevant

1594
04:38:49,396 --> 04:38:57,013
and we're going to Pace all right go down
here

1595
04:38:59,742 --> 04:39:04,894
I mean I mean this is this is pretty
standard stuff I don't even know if it's
worth

1596
04:39:10,783 --> 04:39:16,277
after updating software, properties Tony dad

1597
04:39:17,254 --> 04:39:24,326
this is a a No-No and I'm supposed to do
that anymore I don't even think they support
this anymore

1598
04:39:27,216 --> 04:39:30,745
I don't I don't know if they support I think
they stopped

1599
04:39:34,741 --> 04:39:41,967
we're going to try it everything about my
admin associate thing

1600
04:39:42,243 --> 04:39:46,360
yeah it came it that the Badgers I was doing
absolutely

1601
04:39:48,255 --> 04:39:51,518
yeah I think ansible might might be

1602
04:40:05,621 --> 04:40:08,892
tell Jamie that works for me if that works

1603
04:40:13,583 --> 04:40:21,125
it had them salt look at Addison and Python
3 because I didn't have pythons reinstalled
yeah

1604
04:40:50,327 --> 04:40:54,056
all right so let's do

1605
04:40:58,217 --> 04:41:00,366
yeah let's do this

1606
04:41:09,614 --> 04:41:16,653
what's today's supposed to do get rid of
this

1607
04:41:17,232 --> 04:41:19,335
all right that's good enough

1608
04:41:32,217 --> 04:41:38,276
0.11 + 5.0

1609
04:41:39,294 --> 04:41:46,547
okay we got our install done Afghan TV
Packers game

1610
04:41:46,548 --> 04:42:00,542
I don't know why I can't remember why
there's a so that the whole the whole use of
the key stuff is all been change has been
difficult you get a warning on it every once
in awhile I noticed that in that case it
didn't throw the

1611
04:41:59,550 --> 04:42:04,556
it didn't throw the warning I wonder if
they've covered up that error

1612
04:42:06,908 --> 04:42:12,939
and 50/50 Ansel

1613
04:42:13,414 --> 04:42:15,678
I want to take him there

1614
04:42:16,875 --> 04:42:25,471
this is something to do with the key
management and just putting everything in a
default key ring without a while ago

1615
04:42:27,403 --> 04:42:33,759
I think I'm from an update rather than a
repo pull requests I question how modern the
application is here

1616
04:42:35,304 --> 04:42:41,412
yeah I don't know

1617
04:42:42,599 --> 04:42:46,535
but this is It's a thing

1618
04:42:49,705 --> 04:42:54,806
if you wanted a baby and you have to admit
this is going to talk about her here this
whole receive key stuff

1619
04:42:55,503 --> 04:43:00,987
that's changed that's changed if you ever if
they were asking you that but a fault

1620
04:43:03,534 --> 04:43:08,548
Summer Jam about that FreeBSD ansible now

1621
04:43:09,017 --> 04:43:11,896
Solaris and Swan Arch

1622
04:43:13,083 --> 04:43:20,181
slash clear Linux python pip forget that

1623
04:43:22,831 --> 04:44:15,081
I don't know it's it's keeps right here the
keys I don't know if it's even worth
bringing up I I don't remember all the
details I know that there is a change from
where you put the keys used to just used to
do add key and just add it won't place in an
owl says that that's a lot of standard and
stars are will tell you the warning they
said don't do that anymore they want you to
create your own separate key in the. Dgpg
key ring and I don't know this has been on
me that's why I'm surprised you didn't it
didn't complain just now because they used
to the PPA add which makes me think it might
have been updated by the district this
distribution that I don't know. I don't have
enough information to go on I just vaguely
remember something related to Pas and their
keys has changed because they wanted to
disassociate from a central key ring

1624
04:44:20,747 --> 04:44:23,871
and so she's falling for the modules

1625
04:44:24,905 --> 04:44:36,155
you are a mess I'm not doing it like a
former installation okay ansible all that
champagne ask pass would remember him as
long as we choose you can test that it is so
perfectly with the Ping

1626
04:44:42,650 --> 04:44:49,828
ansible all that Shannon

1627
04:44:50,089 --> 04:44:56,988
being asked us what is it asking for a
password to

1628
04:45:00,448 --> 04:45:06,229
what is the password to I'm a little unclear
on that

1629
04:45:07,911 --> 04:45:13,496
my password is password is going to ride her

1630
04:45:18,490 --> 04:45:25,411
Friday's Hostess is empty only locals is
available note that the implicit localhost
is not match all

1631
04:45:25,774 --> 04:45:33,704
okay so Asian King all

1632
04:45:33,740 --> 04:45:36,050
a stress medicine

1633
04:45:38,540 --> 04:45:44,850
inventory needed we are trying to do some
cooking ratio with ansible

1634
04:45:46,762 --> 04:45:48,875
inventory file

1635
04:45:48,875 --> 04:45:54,925
edit well I didn't we didn't add in a 2000
way way way

1636
04:45:58,319 --> 04:46:03,141
I just says a chance of a hose after you run
a setup

1637
04:46:03,576 --> 04:46:14,620
do you need a ring from cuz it's about the
inventory file me Etsy ansible host you can
actually spend some of the inventory file
how to build an inventory of other than a
table

1638
04:46:14,621 --> 04:46:18,154
Echo to ansible hosts

1639
04:46:18,154 --> 04:46:22,719
does it seriously read from. Ansible hosts

1640
04:46:22,719 --> 04:46:26,275
oh I see you can you connect me with
inventory

1641
04:46:26,276 --> 04:46:31,787
Kmart Madea Mary file has ever again

1642
04:46:31,788 --> 04:46:39,271
it raining right now we're going to say
things are actually aspie

1643
04:46:40,158 --> 04:46:46,555
now I canI can figure out ansible it doesn't
happen already and maybe it does

1644
04:46:50,863 --> 04:46:54,367
and you could say

1645
04:47:05,108 --> 04:47:07,265
as of all house

1646
04:47:09,212 --> 04:47:18,909
went to 70. One I think that would be unwise
why don't I just put kind of names here

1647
04:47:20,413 --> 04:47:26,796
with that how about that and then

1648
04:47:33,258 --> 04:47:41,070
ansible inventory let me know

1649
04:47:47,340 --> 04:47:50,166
export ansible

1650
04:47:53,644 --> 04:47:57,143
Ansell inventory equals

1651
04:48:01,605 --> 04:48:04,613
let's talk big / ansible

1652
04:48:05,005 --> 04:48:10,551
air hose subnet it doesn't have that it
doesn't appear to need that

1653
04:48:22,081 --> 04:48:28,364
if you have a charger I hope you like lots
of it right okay

1654
04:48:31,820 --> 04:48:39,541
wait nice all right so let's do

1655
04:48:40,525 --> 04:48:47,274
make sure I can still connect it up and
let's go up here and see what's next

1656
04:48:48,571 --> 04:48:55,445
ansible all that's ending

1657
04:48:56,528 --> 04:48:58,480
hey it did it

1658
04:48:59,199 --> 04:49:07,219
and it didn't have to connect to the
password cuz I did the thing with the names
which is good

1659
04:49:07,652 --> 04:49:18,509
discovered interpreter python is a 3.8
change face of a ping-pong is it thing my
God I feel so successful

1660
04:49:23,231 --> 04:49:29,419
touch build Vox build a build

1661
04:49:34,045 --> 04:49:35,762
check

1662
04:49:37,286 --> 04:49:42,607
install why am I doing this cuz I want
something that captures

1663
04:49:43,377 --> 04:49:49,658
what I did okay so

1664
04:49:58,342 --> 04:50:00,554
so yeah

1665
04:50:17,843 --> 04:50:20,916
create a

1666
04:50:31,626 --> 04:50:35,726
sue Ed with ansible

1667
04:50:42,070 --> 04:50:48,663
this is this is kind of the solution I don't
want to put the solution stuff in the
challenge itself

1668
04:51:02,171 --> 04:51:03,992
yeah

1669
04:51:22,400 --> 04:51:27,804
and we don't need all this shit but I don't
know man

1670
04:51:41,000 --> 04:51:51,134
I mean I could just write it in that right I
don't have to have it run them so we are
done we're ready to start to figuring so I
feel like we're making progress

1671
04:51:56,521 --> 04:52:04,488
the fact that we are installed already to go
we're ready to make something and I don't
know if they talk about that here and we'll
go check in

1672
04:52:06,651 --> 04:52:09,700
so funny turtles your tag releases

1673
04:52:12,384 --> 04:52:18,225
I guess we'll come at Shell completion is
that a thing

1674
04:52:21,093 --> 04:52:27,267
wait a second I tell me Angela doesn't have
it

1675
04:52:30,715 --> 04:52:32,135
shoot

1676
04:52:36,881 --> 04:52:42,132
is it have it does it generate its own I
think I know you know

1677
04:52:43,300 --> 04:52:44,957
I cannot add it

1678
04:52:50,025 --> 04:52:57,150
orange completion not there

1679
04:52:57,492 --> 04:53:02,679
python are complete for maybe you can find
python or can play for me about red hat
Enterprise

1680
04:53:04,406 --> 04:53:19,169
Captain pollution you can add insult to my
nine you can add shell completion in the
answer will command line utility by
installing an optional dependency called are
complete our complete support Sebastian has
limits for Target complete

1681
04:53:24,679 --> 04:53:32,257
see you at install are complete Hannah B is
a

1682
04:53:33,503 --> 04:53:38,786
so wait for me if you don't run out
Enterprise distributions

1683
04:53:40,559 --> 04:53:47,623
what what the hell

1684
04:53:48,817 --> 04:53:56,086
and symbol what does that do

1685
04:54:05,485 --> 04:54:12,118
and it's just a little too and I would not
do that

1686
04:54:12,462 --> 04:54:16,474
it will list all the facts of your VM

1687
04:54:24,938 --> 04:54:32,784
I was actually JavaScript why are they not
using actual

1688
04:54:32,784 --> 04:54:39,634
why are they not using actual job Jason I
guess they are

1689
04:54:51,872 --> 04:54:54,428
and now yellow

1690
04:54:58,180 --> 04:55:08,059
yeah I'm still looking for completion going
to self python arguably for me then ran in
front of mr. food and or from the standards
of us Rapunzel Ministries

1691
04:55:08,382 --> 04:55:11,808
c r r complete documentation

1692
04:55:15,307 --> 04:55:18,351
and I can tell Sundance. Are they

1693
04:55:19,510 --> 04:55:24,835
oh it's python3 alright this goes into an
installer

1694
04:55:36,552 --> 04:55:38,758
Pine-Sol

1695
04:55:38,896 --> 04:55:44,997
I'm going to go ahead and run this right now
yes I just did a paste from here sue me

1696
04:55:50,108 --> 04:55:53,618
how I just put it here on a shed

1697
04:56:07,264 --> 04:56:12,270
Kid Flash tagged

1698
04:56:21,521 --> 04:56:24,817
alright so

1699
04:56:28,134 --> 04:56:30,107
perfect nail

1700
04:56:31,910 --> 04:56:38,533
it's a little accountability African rand
activity Global python are complete

1701
04:56:41,629 --> 04:56:46,512
I guess I don't really like that but oh well

1702
04:56:47,483 --> 04:56:50,480
I fucking hate python sometimes

1703
04:56:59,024 --> 04:57:00,696
not found

1704
04:57:08,561 --> 04:57:10,704
if I look at that yeah

1705
04:57:16,149 --> 04:57:21,043
what the hell this is a lie

1706
04:57:23,442 --> 04:57:31,089
her command configuration email register
python aranzabal C dock

1707
04:57:31,683 --> 04:57:33,220
if I can get Amy

1708
04:57:39,232 --> 04:57:48,198
I wish people could get it together with a
completion and just used Ashley I can't
believe how what a cluster fuck that is

1709
04:57:51,082 --> 04:57:57,420
so how are we going to do we're going to go
ahead and do

1710
04:58:02,312 --> 04:58:04,784
oh and has a three at the end

1711
04:58:10,736 --> 04:58:12,321
okay

1712
04:58:27,579 --> 04:58:29,403
I hope not

1713
04:58:49,777 --> 04:58:56,380
I hate doing that but LOL all right now what

1714
04:58:58,018 --> 04:59:05,557
ansible still no completion egg sack by
shell

1715
04:59:11,201 --> 04:59:17,516
hey it worked all right fine we got our
completion

1716
04:59:20,557 --> 04:59:28,083
every single Python program has it now
apparently your bash profile yet

1717
04:59:28,083 --> 04:59:31,895
isn't an equation with a Sheltie Sheltie do
not want to do it

1718
04:59:32,095 --> 04:59:37,726
play work soon as we can grazing management
language we probably spend some time doing
that

1719
04:59:40,216 --> 04:59:46,422
we talked about doing that actually in a
readme furnaces execrate your first ansible

1720
04:59:54,125 --> 04:59:58,226
helloworld to monitor those last 5 installs
how'd you do that

1721
05:00:00,105 --> 05:00:05,222
what do you mean I added my own custom
helloworld to monitor last night and so sad
you

1722
05:00:09,015 --> 05:00:14,421
no I'm not monitoring them I just made a
script that installs them

1723
05:00:14,753 --> 05:00:21,732
so that I can just install of ansible in one
command next time still having to go back
and rear-ended so I can't remember
everything

1724
05:00:27,732 --> 05:00:32,227
so yeah that's that's how all right

1725
05:00:33,154 --> 05:00:40,984
I think we're very close and will be gone
the next thing we almost got it we need to

1726
05:00:40,826 --> 05:00:44,107
we need to read about the configuration
language and

1727
05:00:46,615 --> 05:00:53,781
ad hoc commands what are those basic
commands working with Play Books

1728
05:00:56,678 --> 05:01:01,634
all the stuff I do is public it's all here

1729
05:01:03,913 --> 05:01:07,485
oh my God files there's a directory they're
called install

1730
05:01:08,115 --> 05:01:14,525
on a server outside of Playbook really shit
I must learn this

1731
05:01:23,540 --> 05:01:29,832
play around went ping

1732
05:01:30,362 --> 05:01:34,489
and ad hoc commands

1733
05:01:36,227 --> 05:01:40,842
to get a feel for how

1734
05:01:41,159 --> 05:01:48,166
ansible connects and does things this well

1735
05:01:48,373 --> 05:01:51,685
confirm you have a connection as well

1736
05:01:56,386 --> 05:02:00,899
bash restaurant was Reva add hot commands

1737
05:02:02,732 --> 05:02:07,841
ansible at Holcomb and he's just been
answered what command line tool

1738
05:02:08,115 --> 05:02:21,456
I try to make a single tassels on or manage
knows this is like python fabric yeah I'm
super excited by this this I love Fabric and
apparently going to the hood which is to 60

1739
05:02:21,482 --> 05:02:29,329
which is that yep yep yep and I can Hazard a
quick easy to do in Tessa v y a

1740
05:02:32,932 --> 05:02:39,120
ad hoc home and ansible pattern module
module options

1741
05:02:40,795 --> 05:02:43,153
modernist Pantry must be

1742
05:02:43,546 --> 05:02:54,450
you can Rob Patterson on other pages I just
kids write a sentence to reboot servers and
Bubba yeah this is stuff we do with fabric
before I'm super happy about this okay so

1743
05:02:56,204 --> 05:03:02,406
I'm going to make a thing about this for
myself ansible

1744
05:03:03,329 --> 05:03:11,008
ad hoc commands are are

1745
05:03:11,347 --> 05:03:13,632
like fabric

1746
05:03:18,816 --> 05:03:22,498
on the functionality of

1747
05:03:25,796 --> 05:03:31,765
of its much older relative

1748
05:03:31,998 --> 05:03:38,423
python fabric remember

1749
05:03:39,751 --> 05:03:41,782
Fab files

1750
05:03:44,098 --> 05:03:49,542
when do using ad hoc commands

1751
05:03:49,921 --> 05:03:55,061
this is good for me because it's something I
can latch onto memory wise to remember

1752
05:03:56,870 --> 05:04:04,396
which I love I love looking in rebooting
servers yes I did

1753
05:04:04,641 --> 05:04:15,951
is it just a it's just a shade of you
kidding me I'll listen to my not listed in
the group, Atlanta yeah this this is exactly
the same as fabric

1754
05:04:19,706 --> 05:04:29,347
I know it's in your getting ready out this
seriously this is this is how I would run my
tests on multiple system using fabric found
files

1755
05:04:29,557 --> 05:04:35,640
yeah this is super cool I love this ansible

1756
05:04:37,344 --> 05:04:41,415
yeah I'm Nash a l s

1757
05:04:41,710 --> 05:04:52,420
it gives our LS this is ignatz exactly what
found files used to do is basically and
makes it necessary to whatever connection
you know

1758
05:04:52,816 --> 05:05:00,007
let's do sleep 10

1759
05:05:00,944 --> 05:05:06,509
I wonder if it'll do that sounds like a yes

1760
05:05:10,675 --> 05:05:15,118
that's not happy it did it

1761
05:05:15,865 --> 05:05:19,880
all right so

1762
05:05:29,734 --> 05:05:31,488
84 ad hoc

1763
05:05:35,246 --> 05:05:42,933
that's that's good I need to write that down
that's the W and order the X right so I feel
like I got it

1764
05:05:43,216 --> 05:05:44,990
oh God that lets you

1765
05:05:46,341 --> 05:05:56,069
butt implants with only five simultaneous
processes if you have more hoes than the
files at the four count that's awesome

1766
05:05:58,912 --> 05:06:01,155
that is really fucking awesome

1767
05:06:19,844 --> 05:06:21,798
alright so

1768
05:06:22,891 --> 05:06:32,691
this weekend I am so happy I'm learning that
she had no idea this just makes my little
automation hard beat so warmly

1769
05:06:33,559 --> 05:07:01,168
seriously I am like obsessed with automation
so this is super happy to me it just makes
me very very happy we waiting for other
question was asked Alicia and you can
connect to server but the reason block I
think I I think this might be one of my
favorite things I've discovered this year in
2022 I'm kind of late to the party as usual
I can't believe I let you become a different
user

1770
05:07:01,171 --> 05:07:08,235
yeah I can this is just was just fucking
amazing to me damn

1771
05:07:09,489 --> 05:07:18,420
this is this is everything that we used to
do as as using old technology like

1772
05:07:20,211 --> 05:07:25,778
I can't remember the name now before

1773
05:07:25,933 --> 05:07:29,398
I can expect expect isn't ecl

1774
05:07:30,985 --> 05:07:39,664
that's cancel prompts for it the Command
Module does not support extended shell
sensex like popping and rice a little
shelter able to always work

1775
05:07:39,665 --> 05:07:49,047
at your command require Social Service in
Texas to Shell module instead and worry
about that with models so far all of our
samples have the Command Module

1776
05:07:49,049 --> 05:08:07,724
this is the default model cities are
actually using models and it's a Command
Module that passes that exact that's an
exact call and that's why I can't use a show
cos industrial expansion I just different
modules pass a module named example as well
built and she'll module as we're all I am
answerable to show that she

1777
05:08:07,857 --> 05:08:41,492
condemn when are you come out the house but
I talked to you last posed to play books
Temptation test to show courting rules so
that Uncle shower change the variable and
past tense of all right yeah that's because
it's just an exact I just passed is an exit
which is a list of command arguments to the
remote system yeah if I was right I wrote
some stuff like this that would use SSH Once
Upon a Time on that you felt a lot of the
stuff you could have just done with just us
to save so this is just an easier way to do
it hey Tony so

1778
05:08:42,668 --> 05:08:49,316
yeah and Atlanta Dash M built-in copy he
find a repeated task like this

1779
05:08:52,966 --> 05:08:57,409
Itasca horsepower Mansell and SUV oh my god
seriously

1780
05:08:57,410 --> 05:09:06,836
that's M built-in copy that's a source and
destination see why don't you just use STP
for that

1781
05:09:08,072 --> 05:09:25,294
it seems like an extra unnecessary layer of
abstraction and she says to pay but whatever
he finally finished now so I can go to the
most because you can combine with other
stuff I have a feeling that's what built-in
file module blah blah blah and Antelope
servers

1782
05:09:25,343 --> 05:09:30,070
I see if you can work locally or remote so
can I see p

1783
05:09:31,772 --> 05:09:38,794
yeah you're done an excellent your SUV
something and just rename it

1784
05:09:38,794 --> 05:09:41,083
cuz you forgot the colon

1785
05:09:41,956 --> 05:09:46,920
as well web servers SMS with built-in file

1786
05:09:46,964 --> 05:09:50,019
blah blah blue blue blue

1787
05:09:51,800 --> 05:09:54,969
changing ownership to the files

1788
05:09:54,970 --> 05:10:01,976
at about the five mother can also create
directories accelerate like missing you
Lucci that's that's what the weather is

1789
05:10:02,511 --> 05:10:18,258
I look like an accident yeah absolutely yeah
I was still use are asking for that imagine
there's an ansible rule to do that but that
was Sylvia shell scripting in are and arson
called to me

1790
05:10:19,340 --> 05:10:26,226
yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah I think
absolutely does not replace our sink

1791
05:10:26,434 --> 05:10:28,969
no it doesn't

1792
05:10:30,128 --> 05:10:40,584
I mean if I didn't have ansible I would do
is rsync break

1793
05:10:42,142 --> 05:10:48,675
no way to get me to take home I got it
smells so good it's joke with Wally

1794
05:10:50,996 --> 05:10:58,082
alright I got to go eat I'm going to go eat
I don't know when I'm going to be back

1795
05:10:59,424 --> 05:11:23,305
probably soon though we're making progress
with an ad-hoc commands and stuff so I'm on
my way we made a lot of progress today hey
see you if you guys have to leave for the
night I understand have a great day see you
tomorrow I will be cool working tomorrow I
don't know how much I will be streaming but
I will do some of it tonight later I'll be
applying which were probably in addition to
getting this one this stuff to work

1796
05:11:24,993 --> 05:11:30,566
I got the Vodka for sure yeah have K on

1797
05:11:31,895 --> 05:11:36,826
and I'm going to stop and get myself 20
minutes but I might be back before then

1798
05:11:37,443 --> 05:11:41,531
back back in 2010

1799
05:29:25,833 --> 05:29:27,513
okay okay

1800
05:29:34,539 --> 05:29:35,997
let's go for it

1801
05:29:54,793 --> 05:29:58,273
huh all right

1802
05:30:13,652 --> 05:30:20,677
do it supposed to snow on Thursday ohmygod
magic packages

1803
05:30:21,135 --> 05:30:23,477
as for web servers built in

1804
05:30:28,100 --> 05:30:35,501
as well Milton yeah I miss Wilson Young web
servers managing users & groups

1805
05:30:36,756 --> 05:30:39,265
it's obvious in users & groups

1806
05:30:42,657 --> 05:30:49,561
it's in service what restart ACP service

1807
05:30:52,443 --> 05:30:55,309
Gathering facts and symbol all

1808
05:30:56,502 --> 05:31:04,401
I said patterns for a dad who commands and
all the available options putting how to
limit using powers that hog

1809
05:31:05,968 --> 05:31:10,026
I told her the only repeated attacks taxes
Ansel playbooks

1810
05:31:11,922 --> 05:31:18,331
Hickory eating configuring ansible a
collection so

1811
05:31:19,910 --> 05:31:27,319
what are the tasks rightright so this is
where we have to figure out what we're going
to do on this p.m.

1812
05:31:27,854 --> 05:31:29,987
and and how are you doing

1813
05:31:35,385 --> 05:31:40,490
I still am wondering how to create the VM in
the first place through script

1814
05:31:49,821 --> 05:31:52,266
I don't know if Ava need to do everything

1815
05:31:57,347 --> 05:32:04,874
you know I you know what let's do the sweet
weed in Sebastopol stuff thank you for that
stuff yeah

1816
05:32:05,426 --> 05:32:09,315
well we work we started okay so let me
regroup

1817
05:32:10,026 --> 05:32:16,823
recycled to answer those I want to build a
configure things after gets installed right
and I still need to do that but

1818
05:32:18,334 --> 05:32:54,919
the bottom line is I want to be able to
bring up a kubernetes environment really
quickly potential at my local machine using
the ATM's that are here and that means
provisioning a bunch of EMS and then
configuring those mediums with all the stuff
they need to be to be a crazed cluster or
just be able to reset on a Dell to reset I
want to go to say hey I want you know 3 or 4
RPMs with nodes and then I want to do them
and that's what vagran has been done in the
past but and is kind of outdated and old and
doesn't work

1819
05:32:56,980 --> 05:33:04,949
and that's where Ansel came from I want to
be able to configure my local environment I
feel like I know enough about how to do this

1820
05:33:06,405 --> 05:33:17,508
I know what it does and what a play book
looks like I know how to install stuff on it
I mean we could do that we could

1821
05:33:17,815 --> 05:33:21,117
we could we can set that part up right so

1822
05:33:22,976 --> 05:33:31,850
absolutely sure there is already kubernetes
there's there's already already in recipes
for sodium carbonate he's on a node

1823
05:33:32,015 --> 05:33:33,568
but

1824
05:33:33,955 --> 05:33:47,232
I kind of I kind of want to do that so one
of the things I like to do now that we got
liverto deliver permission from his working
is I'd like to return tonight I'm going to
have to take another quick break but then

1825
05:33:47,270 --> 05:33:55,628
I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to think
through this and I I'd like we got it we got
ansible already he remained you know

1826
05:33:56,485 --> 05:33:59,107
and that's that's really it

1827
05:34:03,635 --> 05:34:10,176
you know I see a 75 nothing

1828
05:34:10,200 --> 05:34:16,359
we need to put some other stuff. But install
open

1829
05:34:16,359 --> 05:34:21,044
SSH server on the virtual machine

1830
05:34:21,158 --> 05:34:26,496
yeah this is thing I find interesting this
is not something that I think can be
automated

1831
05:34:30,530 --> 05:34:33,789
and I'm concerned about this because

1832
05:34:37,295 --> 05:34:39,947
I mean the only way

1833
05:34:42,152 --> 05:34:49,690
I think I think the cloud images come with
SSH on them by default you know what I mean

1834
05:34:51,833 --> 05:34:56,209
I mean I mean to take stock of the goal

1835
05:34:56,232 --> 05:35:00,758
and it's trip to the installer to terraform

1836
05:35:00,759 --> 05:35:06,791
but I have a feeling if I use so let's say
let's let's just back up a few steps if I

1837
05:35:06,892 --> 05:35:13,749
if I want to provision a bunch of nodes
communities notes and I want knows me to
bbm's

1838
05:35:14,020 --> 05:35:20,836
I can run terraform up against a recipe or
whatever

1839
05:35:20,836 --> 05:35:24,620
was even called I can remember but

1840
05:35:24,620 --> 05:35:29,676
and and I can use the cloud image

1841
05:35:29,676 --> 05:35:57,374
and the clown image will come with SSH by
the fault I mean we know we know that the
other reason I want to stop right now
because I've been working with the Linux
Mint one just to see if it worked but I want
to be able to do this with either the a
bunch of the red hat server at this point
I'm thinking about using redhead servers
just cuz I mean we talked a lot about it and
I kind of feel like I'm going to get

1842
05:35:57,376 --> 05:36:02,134
and so we bring up me I don't even know how
I would do a rats or do we do not send it
with

1843
05:36:00,609 --> 05:36:05,422
do we have a set of us anyway I'm getting
out of myself

1844
05:36:05,968 --> 05:36:15,597
I want to come back to automating the
creation of the servers with SSH installed
so that works

1845
05:36:16,146 --> 05:36:20,453
as now a stranger rhel did they believe that
the rest of us back right

1846
05:36:22,132 --> 05:36:25,374
LeBron said he was back they got rid of it
and then he brought it back

1847
05:36:26,053 --> 05:36:34,380
Aurora is too but I think what is the
closest thing to read Enterprise Linux that
anybody could install in their own from

1848
05:36:35,417 --> 05:36:40,082
it's all right action and it did to yeah
they got rid of it

1849
05:36:41,228 --> 05:36:53,116
it was big news about that and then they
brought it back somehow I don't know how the
rebranding of people react very badly is
that what happened haha so

1850
05:36:55,532 --> 05:37:10,910
okay so if I'm going to create a non-profit
environment that's most likely to parallel
the type of environment that I would be
managing on-prem for statistical a probable
Enterprise

1851
05:37:10,919 --> 05:37:47,319
I would be setting up a bunch of red hat
Enterprise Linux server probably be doing
such a mess and I don't know but I assume
the sensuous standard server image comes
with s sh would make no sense but didn't
given the fact that they also do ansible and
then I probably don't need to do anything
else I have a feeling that I can write a
terraformed whatever map or whatever and I
can create I can run it and get you know
five actual vm's using terraform and then
you can figure those

1852
05:37:48,760 --> 05:37:50,940
I'd like rockin on the Lennox

1853
05:37:51,601 --> 05:38:34,085
araki in Alma I thought about this William I
don't want to be too much on the edge there
I probably would like to experiment with
that stuff but I want my base cluster to be
as close to the most probable on Frank
Loesser I would encounter and right now
that's right then and I I just made that
decision today which is different than how I
was thinking about it when I was going to
tear from before when it when we before we
left when we went with a liberty provider
was just have a lot of support I I kind of
we hit all those permissions problems with
you since gotten past and I'm inclined to
use the unpopular Levert provider for
terraform rather than create

1854
05:38:34,085 --> 05:38:49,618
a a separate VM as a client for terraforming
then use my whole system as in the server to
be provisioned and cut up which is the way
to do it up time I've been up for 5 hours 30
minutes

1855
05:38:50,571 --> 05:38:53,993
so so I think I think I've got that done

1856
05:38:53,994 --> 05:39:48,196
so what I'm trying to say is I'm going to
put ansible the bed for bit I got it to work
I know how to use it pretty basic stuff and
writing writing the Play Books is just a
matter of knowing what the yellow
configuration files and say what you want to
install and I do want to do that but but but
I'm kind of stressing out because tomorrow
you go back to work and I really really
really need a VM that I can beat the shit
out of me so that I can test my for my
persistence volume Monitor and I don't have
that yet so I need to set that up and that's
actually my top priority so you do that I'm
going to put out the terraformed I don't
mind taking it a rabbit hole to try to
reform again and it comes down to it by the
end of the night I was just provision 3 vm's
by hand using give me what delivered they
have a diversion

1857
05:39:48,200 --> 05:39:50,722
you get Rachel for free

1858
05:39:52,276 --> 05:39:57,987
did you ever do a version you need to
register I probably do that

1859
05:39:58,078 --> 05:40:07,667
but yeah I mean this is cool and all that
this is is not what I want this is not for
that the endgame right I do like it though
I'll keep it around

1860
05:40:12,916 --> 05:40:15,229
Sand Key

1861
05:40:19,247 --> 05:40:24,937
quit set running still

1862
05:40:29,968 --> 05:40:35,973
816 installs I don't want I'm just going to
send to us

1863
05:40:38,764 --> 05:40:42,142
when it when I actually want to do I
actually think I'm going to kill two birds

1864
05:40:40,887 --> 05:40:47,969
I'm going to kill two birds with one stone I
like that saying but they going to probably
end up doing is provisioning

1865
05:40:50,220 --> 05:40:56,499
like six nodes six or seven notes

1866
05:40:57,486 --> 05:41:02,077
add creating a coronavirus environment using
Cube ATM

1867
05:41:02,485 --> 05:41:45,048
and I'm going to set up my own storage class
using an offense and then I'm going to
overwhelm the NFL stores by
over-provisioning over allocating just to
keep my pvc I actually think I can get that
pretty quickly I do everything pretty slowly
but but I think I understand how that would
be good I don't want these kind for that and
that's one of the reasons I was doing this
is I mean I can explain what kind of kind is
not a direct comparison to what I want to do
so I'm going to go ahead and provision local
NFS somehow and then I'm going to over
allocate resources to that I'm afraid some
way tomorrow.

1868
05:41:45,054 --> 05:42:04,965
It might seem like Overkill to deploy a full
cabinet is environment just to test
provisioning you know what the PVC
consumption checks but I need to do all of
that anyway so this is this is my way of
going about doing it thanks

1869
05:42:05,158 --> 05:42:06,645
so

1870
05:42:07,074 --> 05:42:17,363
and I want to do it with her for him I want
to stick with her from the Isabel because of
the primary tools that the world is using
these days even if our company is kind of
behind on that

1871
05:42:18,128 --> 05:42:21,233
and it still

1872
05:42:38,592 --> 05:42:46,180
Santos 3 made okay yeah

1873
05:42:49,460 --> 05:42:52,319
so we went through this

1874
05:43:04,380 --> 05:43:06,961
Shish repo ad

1875
05:43:10,154 --> 05:43:15,443
no cheese info create

1876
05:43:30,861 --> 05:43:33,434
example for associative

1877
05:43:47,992 --> 05:43:50,399
all right

1878
05:44:07,396 --> 05:44:09,986
why is my fan coming on

1879
05:44:20,731 --> 05:44:23,777
maybe texting is a little bit too much

1880
05:44:29,238 --> 05:44:32,285
ten 7 to ten years wow

1881
05:44:42,948 --> 05:44:50,374
wow that's pretty amazing that's that's
that's the one I want to use it

1882
05:44:55,303 --> 05:44:59,094
all right so when I come in this

1883
05:45:04,955 --> 05:45:12,513
what oh

1884
05:45:31,919 --> 05:45:38,511
chances are and you get burned if you are
eating a snake head off

1885
05:45:42,784 --> 05:45:47,079
yeah I can see that happening

1886
05:45:52,250 --> 05:45:55,214
all right so we will see this

1887
05:45:58,568 --> 05:46:06,568
I go back in the lab terraformed thing and
I'm going to set my status

1888
05:46:11,324 --> 05:46:13,371
Sarah still cool learning
