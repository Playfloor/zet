3
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,255

listener

4
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:38,927

9
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:04,628

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,414

147
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:51,733
I think it's old it's also do 2017 it was
made his support for nagios we use it at
work and I need to talk to the thing that's
the main reason it's here

148
00:40:54,376 --> 00:41:00,848
and because of that what's wrong with her
being 16

149
00:41:00,848 --> 00:41:10,053
I think it's so cool because she was a
university professor and she was sixteen and
she was in your University Hospital and
that's awesome

150
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,046
okay

151
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:26,496
I don't know is that what you're suggesting
you just spit it out just spit it out

152
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:34,283
and I don't know why you're telling me this
story I can't read between the lines I'm
dumb

153
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,799
system diseases like come on baby

154
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:52,245
I got a six-year-old girl bring you flowers
did she think you're hot is that the problem
is that the problem

155
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:02,116
alright well then you have to make a
decision

156
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:21,962
all right babe I feel she's consenting
adults I don't know what's the story get to
the point the decision is no it is session
is no there's no decision

157
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:27,897
all right so what

158
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:33,525
16 is a consenting adults in the United
States

159
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:39,363
so is it or is it 18 I should probably
figure that out

160
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:43,876
yeah I'm pretty sure it's 16

161
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:50,356
is it 18 shit say I would have been in
trouble

162
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:55,501
121 it is not

163
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:02,560
is 18 it is 18/16 and you say no the end

164
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:09,883
and she doesn't say if she doesn't tell you
she's sixteen and you're screwed it's like
you're like having like a handle

165
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:11,742
like whatever

166
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:22,766

their back and Wharton unsavory places

244
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:58,822

and that you would invent that stream you
and that testing there's plenty of streams
out there good you go you go you just go

go with that I'm sure it'll be just fine

247
00:55:18,132 --> 00:55:26,711
I would have to be the straight guy which is
unusual for me like as in you know they have

focus on this so I get it running

258
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:17,059
I feel like this is working now I could be
wrong

259
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:36,932
it was a tiring I know I was at tiring it
was it was totally boring

260
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:44,266
I know I have moment Sonata moments go teach
kids in VR

261
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:51,255

can I change my trays to home vagrant

263
00:57:58,185 --> 00:58:18,784
when is the 3-day when you're talking to the
guy I'm with mohawks in Second Life I'll
have you know it's a big fucking deal on the
3D World for like from 2007 until probably
2010 at built I built my own virtual worlds

264
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:30,422
a lot of money to support virtual
conferences and the edtech retreat I gave
demonstrations to the international Society
for taking education for the use of 3D for
education

265
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:42,614
I I mean I can go on and on I-90 that stuff
I have that at that train has left the
building I'm kind of I'm kind of interested
to see where this VR stuff goes over cuz
it's kind of bring it back so

266
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:49,280
diners at the end it was said that we are

267
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:55,627

270
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,760
Health Annex health education failed

271
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:16,651

personification for that

272
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:22,280
Arabian white we don't use anymore that's
what was up we don't need that

274
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:34,229

275
00:59:37,162 --> 00:59:43,142
Universal over the railroads and I'll admit
I'm in reality

to adopt they don't

277
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:55,653
they don't that's what that was why I
stopped doing it around a business in it

278
00:59:55,653 --> 01:00:31,679
yeah I sold training certification in
education in VR in s life and it just became
really apparent that there is a certain
personality type of after much much
conversations with many many people and
teachers there's a certain type of human who
cannot participate of you there's two things
that stop BR from being assertive serious
solution for education and I hate it say I
hate saying this because I was a huge for
phone number for more than seven years one
of them is at the technology is too heavy
literally too heavy is too heavy to put it
on your face it cost too much to do you
can't have a laptop that

279
01:00:30,677 --> 01:01:27,784
that when we are came out in this the third
time I came out like whenever she will come
out so I can let nothing to him they the two
things I cannot together or mobile so mobile
was really big and all these really really
heavy 3D worlds were a big and they required
a relationship you and a bunch of the stuff
in those two solutions came out the same
time and mobile one mobile one and everybody
left IBM had 50 Sims of which I was a part
of that I was I was helping to maintain and
I ran most mentor to community in IBM for
IBM I was an active you know the doshin turn
on the SD virtual world I created ballet
Simms and art and stuff I got a ton of shit
credit combat systems all of this stuff and
nobody use it I mean they use it then all
the Bandit also use the same okay okay

280
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:32,579
okay go out Sam can you shut the door thank
you

281
01:01:32,666 --> 01:02:31,994
anyway it says the two things there's it's
too big technology it is schools can't
afford to get a computer with a big big big
ass GPU for everybody that was the first
problem in the second problem is I mean they
barely can afford iPads for the kids let
alone you know computers in a lab within go
use it for education and the second thing is
there's a certain personality type that just
never responds to 3D avatars they're just
never will there it's like the neurology
they just will never ever respond to it so
you can't create a solution that forces
everybody to do then and so it was a two
reasons that virtual servers as an
educational popcorn failed big time and I
can cite the case studies where people with
thousands of dollars millions of dollars
into it and they had to pull it off because
it failed including IBM Honda there's a
hotel if they did some universities

282
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:36,055

disrespecting I can't so we've got most of
our installation done

366
01:17:51,539 --> 01:18:03,391
and we need to shift gears the web server
now and it does say if you're into Apache go
someplace else so if you use Apache you
might be able to chime in here

367
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:12,031
free Misty and executed Apache why would you
think so all that shit really

368
01:18:12,774 --> 01:18:15,294

389
01:20:52,941 --> 01:20:58,188
I don't use whatever works and I don't want
to change too many variables we could just
cause

390
01:20:58,188 --> 01:21:06,360
so they've chosen patches of primary thing

general monitoring if you sing a sing a

a very specific application I don't
recommend it

400
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:27,973
necessarily I have to test it because it's
it's what we have to talk to at work and so

401
01:22:27,974 --> 01:22:36,859
but this is actually kind of a good
experience with vagrants and reminding me
how to configure a document stuff you know

out mine works for just fine and I was like
okay

415
01:24:56,522 --> 01:25:02,512
I'm configured it for $100,000 contracts
into played it alright great

416
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:16,089
chunky silver found the problem in an hour
we were able to get a gun he's pissed off
man he cannot see whatever they were they
got so pissed off as some people man

417
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:25,312
they just there you go sis will not you know
I'm sure it was your fault I'm like well
then why is it working now

418
01:25:27,464 --> 01:25:35,525
I I told you that I know you didn't I'm sure
it's going to go look at the logs I don't
give a shit

419
01:25:35,642 --> 01:25:39,786
the only say it because I just want
everybody wanting to know

420
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:49,534
what how not to behave in it it's really
hard you're going to end up working with
people like that this is not the kind of
people that you want to have in your team

421
01:25:49,742 --> 01:26:03,943
the ones that have to be right and that will
say I told you so or they don't like being
your face seriously in your face I mean God
knows I am that way I am this person myself
many times so it's something that I know I
have to fight as one

422
01:26:04,929 --> 01:26:48,847
we're from the future to some good faith we
all need to do that I don't do it I felt
often and miserably at that platitude I do
not do that I am just as it is it kind of a
sickness in it this really really easy to be
like them out of this works for me on the
way I talk to you you know an end to be
pedantic her to come off as condescending I
do it all the time people hate me people
hate me in the suffering techno dude group
because of it and I acknowledge that it's a
failing and I try to get over it but it but
it's just as well I get reminded what it's
like to be on the other end of it and then I
am like it's nice to have to I don't have
the fucking deal with us

423
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:54,072
hi Channel. I know it's and I don't matter
even sorry

424
01:26:54,073 --> 01:27:00,123
if I tried I've had to do it at least four
or five times now

425
01:27:00,124 --> 01:27:42,748
you're good people two people that were very
contributing and I was drunk and triggers
for a long time and then they just went on
one of their chariots and they can't cancel
me because I'm the streamer and they can
leave and maybe they'll come back eventually
I've started timing out instead of banning
but everytime I type something out then I'm
going back because that type of personality
does not come back they usually don't and I
get it all the industry fuck I wouldn't
touch you with a ten-foot pole there's no
way there's no way you could give me to go
anywhere near Gainesville on it I'm going to
do it as an indie developer and Beyond to do
it on your own time and have an actual job
someplace else and I think you knew it was
going to work the problem is they work too
much and then I'd appreciate it and they're
not paid for it

426
01:27:42,753 --> 01:27:48,417
go to Cloud native in May trainer thousand a
year and do your game development on the
site for fun

427
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:52,402
that's what I say

428
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:58,887
nor does it need more games the world needs
more infrastructure

429
01:27:58,888 --> 01:28:04,176
games are bad if you want to do it underpaid
Hellyeah

430
01:28:05,074 --> 01:28:29,385
has to do with ecstasy I just leave the
conversation happens and if people have
problems is like a distraction cuz those
things is worth the fight I was totally fine
and they said that was using it was great
and they're like and they they said I
honestly have no idea how come this doesn't
work this works for me and I've never had
any problems with it ever

431
01:28:29,389 --> 01:28:36,460
and then I just got pissed cuz I was
frustratedI pissed cuz I was frustrated I've
been spending most of the day working on it
on something else and it was at the end of
the day

432
01:28:37,052 --> 01:28:47,483
I said okay well somebody else had the exact
same problem and they were able to help me
in an hour and he just came unglued came
unglued when I said that

433
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:55,992
I didn't feel like being nice so

434
01:28:56,404 --> 01:29:04,156
did I say would be was like all great right
I'm happy for you I didn't work for me
though I must be really dumb

435
01:29:07,152 --> 01:29:15,840
it's so and it was like yeah you're all over
the place you're method of testing things
that is completely unscientific it's like
you're not gorgonize and you were drunk

436
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:20,275
oh you have anything else to add to that in
my stream

437
01:29:22,145 --> 01:29:47,010
it is a laughing now I'm laughing now I'm
laughing this is my new is the 2022 Rob I'm
able to laugh off this kind of stuff because
if I let every single pedantic condescending
asshole who's much like me that's why it
pisses me off come into this room and like
start telling me all the things I'm doing
wrong with my life that are making me unable
to do something else I was just wouldn't do
it

438
01:29:47,233 --> 01:29:54,682
I haven't been in for the role does not need
any more sassy suffer the service you think

439
01:29:54,968 --> 01:29:58,259
well I I probably agree with them

440
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:07,329
but a boy we got to follow up with that
thank you for that you're in for a wild ride

441
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:09,838
Okay so

442
01:30:10,726 --> 01:30:19,494
hey look we're at we're doing the iPic
arrested up so I think we're very close cuz
it's exactly what I want I might be able to
talk to the rest API and send messages doing
that

443
01:30:20,024 --> 01:30:49,754
suffer is inconsistent I think is right and
different ways different people how many
software has had plenty of cases where I
went well how did you manage to get it to
the state that it broke that bad but it was
following me looking into how to fix it
while you was doing the same thing and
frankly I don't even think they were being
mean by saying it may have been a little bit
mean before though I've had them say Jesus
just stop typing I didn't type this one like
I had somebody said let me take over the
keyboard and I'm like

444
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:59,142
that was when I showed him you know Nick
Burns your company's computer guy because
the people that are in this job have no idea
how to help people

445
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:32,166
most of the time that people who really know
how to do this stuff have no fucking idea
how to communicate and educate another and
they don't want to say just rather talk down
to them or tell him to move and do it for
him I know these people I've dealt with them
I felt like five or six hundred people that
take it from entering the door that way and
and and I'm that way I can just let music
award god dammit that is not how you help me
learn to get through the problem under no I
just tell him to tell me to use this whole
time I was like under no circumstances do
you ever touch the keyboard

446
01:31:34,053 --> 01:32:31,129
at you know because that's what they would
do the chance I want to just let me help you
like you're not going to help them learn it
if you can literally type it for them but
they they get so frustrated by the fact that
they're not picking it up that they would
rather just do it had to be done and that is
not how you help others learn and it's the
one I'm asking for others to help me learn
and help others learn that I can do just let
me do the typing like we don't want to just
sit and watch you fix it we want to hear the
steps to fix it that's why I'm screaming and
it drives people crazy people crazy so just
goes to show really smart amazing people
that make crazy gobs of money are absolutely
horrible at helping other people understand
what they're doing a lot of times and that
this skill of breaking something down into
going through it's simply step-by-step I
believe is in very very underappreciated
skill in the tech world and it's one that I
happened happened to excel at and that's why
I'm here

447
01:32:31,136 --> 01:32:32,419
so

448
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:44,201
I don't do drugs that have a a command line
break it down when he's doing yeah yeah it's
like okay here's what we're doing here is
why we're doing it this way you know these
are the things that change

449
01:32:44,457 --> 01:33:07,404
I think that's the way to do it and that's
what I aspired to do as long as I don't seem
to just jump through and you know I'm not
interested in explaining everything but but
in general I think that's the best way to do
it really great Engineers are not
necessarily great at sharing and helping
others and don't need to be taken the job
done

450
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:10,858
so you going to feel like a man blah blah
blah blah blah

451
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:20,731
I see you going to see how I came and I seen
your face up to anybody have had future I
substitute because as well as the new API is
a goddess interactive thing

452
01:33:22,582 --> 01:33:33,161
I said I got my my patience my spending half
my pay student for mathematical logic and
communicating for sale God yeah I can
imagine I can imagine you have

453
01:33:33,830 --> 01:34:32,778
yeah you're in the show it's got to be so
frustrating for people on the other end of
this to stream to it's like one of those
times when you like a one-way communication
with high-bandwidth towards you and not from
you is really frustrating somebody I've had
people say like this is way too, the best
way to do that by the way it's just say I'm
sorry this is far too complicated to explain
in chat haircut before like typing it trying
to give you a status Rick complex topic I
like don't you don't have to tell me
everything just show me the show me the
links to the resources I can go to the
research you have to spell it out and Chucky
I mean you typing in and ensuring they were
doing the other day was absolutely
astounding because you were just able to
type so much in you know and it would that's
that takes a lot of work and I have all of
these logs you know in my chat history and
go back to you but that's why I spend so
much time documenting the precise things
that you're telling me so that other people
can have it because otherwise it would be
lost to the ether right it's just that the
random people to happen to be here watching

454
01:34:32,888 --> 01:34:45,067
okay I'm going to try to restore deleted on
to find a new pool manager at Grace at fault
again is there a preventative and not that I
know not that I know of a link Gamecast is
live

455
01:34:45,409 --> 01:34:49,314
yeah you want to get yelled down at

456
01:34:49,655 --> 01:35:01,357
I love those guys but they are they are
definitely Lenox get to dudes people you
can't even run the sound like a man to sing
a PSI this interactive I don't want to do
this interactive thing

457
01:35:03,807 --> 01:35:10,461
turn evil the API feature and certificate as
well as an API user use a route without a
password or

458
01:35:12,078 --> 01:35:14,548
in the excommunication file

459
01:35:14,651 --> 01:35:21,804
edit the event filed add the new API is a
project specify the permissions as tribute
shit

460
01:35:24,053 --> 01:35:29,930
I didn't want to do this I might just copy
one over

461
01:35:30,052 --> 01:35:34,829
actually can always post you can always
supposed to last as long as they are going
to get me banned or something

462
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:38,170
I don't like boobs and shit

463
01:35:42,546 --> 01:35:47,482
latest alkaline I Singa monkey manual

464
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:51,503
I think we just went through a lot of that
part right in me

465
01:35:59,785 --> 01:36:03,999
yep and then I believe this is the same and
I'm reading right now actually

466
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:08,722
this is different I see no manufacture
Nation

467
01:36:12,279 --> 01:36:19,707
it's just the filing is generated from a p i
set up I have a feeling it is pictures of
Lena

468
01:36:21,746 --> 01:36:24,690
it's probably what I should have wizards

469
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:39,486
yeah I couldn't then I see a comes in at 9

470
01:36:40,513 --> 01:36:46,947
logging preferences

471
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:56,880
action figures I don't know if I want to be
with me I I guess I should see what you

472
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:04,193
you did that did that we need to love you
though

473
01:37:06,409 --> 01:37:14,269
god dammit guess which direction

474
01:37:18,637 --> 01:37:21,366
all right

475
01:37:38,933 --> 01:37:46,046
Advanced Optics I wouldn't want you Manilow
write me when you got a minute

476
01:37:46,047 --> 01:37:51,621
assembly me if I love you I'm really nice I
might do an API stuff already it's

477
01:37:50,103 --> 01:37:56,775
ABI stuff already it's already got me doing
what female said I know that's a different
thing

478
01:37:58,851 --> 01:38:03,965
Mario I think we want to do I don't think we
actually want to do male I think I think

479
01:38:07,573 --> 01:38:09,925
but this is a good resource for sure

480
01:38:15,293 --> 01:38:20,201
I mean insulation of singer Hip Hop

481
01:38:24,561 --> 01:38:26,066
Minnesota

482
01:38:35,384 --> 01:38:38,053
that's a really good resource thank you

483
01:38:43,436 --> 01:38:45,183
oh it's in there

484
01:38:51,272 --> 01:38:52,667
symbol

485
01:38:58,049 --> 01:38:59,439
I'll be right back

486
01:39:57,236 --> 01:39:59,588
all right

487
01:40:25,469 --> 01:40:27,495
nicest you

488
01:40:29,019 --> 01:40:36,796
everything you wish for Christmas official
resource and they help you puppet Chef if
you have an immediate cessation of single
word to you may want to get to wizard

489
01:40:37,728 --> 01:40:48,000
how do you think yourself is it okay to take
us to me years ago asking if you are using
both stressed that we thought that you had a
chance we can please I sing it to insulation

490
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:54,544
it's a blessing to web packages do we have
the packages in already

491
01:41:02,141 --> 01:41:08,989
these are my packages right these are this
is how you do the thing restarted sing it to
deactivate configuration

492
01:41:11,025 --> 01:41:18,552
I mean I'm feeling we did most of the stuff
I think we just need to do the rest API now

493
01:41:20,151 --> 01:41:24,405
a song a song a single web 2

494
01:41:25,929 --> 01:41:30,945
say if I sing it to rest API why would you
do the rest of him before installing

495
01:41:36,871 --> 01:41:43,692
let me see if you're not part of the Apache
web server I think it's broken how kind of
weird

496
01:41:55,857 --> 01:41:59,990
it's recipe I have three monitoring core
node really

497
01:42:00,705 --> 01:42:15,582
I tell the rest of you has a different
configuration I sing it's like a single with
two if we can feel the sting of a doctors
for further instructions something if you
did say that I'm using I seen on TV

498
01:42:15,584 --> 01:42:18,000
missing window air condition

499
01:42:23,223 --> 01:42:26,931
are you getting some rest API okay that
makes sense

500
01:42:30,667 --> 01:42:32,806
I don't even know if I needI don't even know
if I need the web then

501
01:42:33,185 --> 01:42:41,075
other than to monitor it right I need to be
able to talk to it to send it messages but I
need to go to see that the messages came in
so I probably need to do the web thing

502
01:42:44,427 --> 01:42:51,062
add ons applications after installation over
you I already went through this salacious of

503
01:42:51,955 --> 01:42:57,571
I saw that this is this is going to be for
the web stuff you have

504
01:42:57,623 --> 01:43:01,451
I see so so I'm not doing I got to do the
API stuff

505
01:43:03,438 --> 01:43:06,040
this isn't this part can be automated

506
01:43:09,188 --> 01:43:13,094
because we got you can run still like him an
API setup

507
01:43:15,129 --> 01:43:20,644
even G no but I had Tennessee

508
01:43:21,748 --> 01:43:24,038
and I looks kind of cool

509
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:39,969
that is it that was it wait a second
account.

510
01:43:49,694 --> 01:43:53,018
If that's it then we're kind of done

511
01:43:56,038 --> 01:44:01,733
just buy the permissions issue with the name
of mission choir let's go see what it did

512
01:44:02,608 --> 01:44:09,975
I think we can just grab some from Mission
out that we don't need to do anything with
it

513
01:44:14,938 --> 01:44:21,477
UPS condemn it

514
01:44:53,096 --> 01:44:54,437
I see

515
01:44:54,861 --> 01:45:02,503
any occasion I think she's right I guess you
can see if ye already has a root hey look
there's my password

516
01:45:02,832 --> 01:45:09,650
just letting you know I'm sharing it with
y'all I'll let you two have done enough

517
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:17,059
I I don't think we are going to need the

say wait no wait no it's just like fighting
fighting with her owner of other things that
she gave up her she just let her have it

594

10 years

I single can be the owner

611
02:00:33,133 --> 02:00:37,994
I had it backwards I did it backwards that's
why I'm testing it

612
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:45,751
yes sir yes sir three I'm an idiot area

613

614
02:00:56,032 --> 02:01:03,568
Packers offense is going missing right away
that's what everybody says to use I haven't
used it

615
02:01:03,569 --> 02:01:09,760
do you think I was better other than being a
distro named after a Mormon prophet

616
02:01:11,579 --> 02:01:18,638
soso I was wondering not use it just for
that I don't know that that's true

617
02:01:20,198 --> 02:01:24,148
is the alma Linux distribution

618
02:01:27,354 --> 02:01:30,790
named after Mormon prophet

619
02:01:32,389 --> 02:01:38,589
Norman's fuck another text so that would not
scare me I mean I would not surprise me at
all

620
02:01:40,889 --> 02:01:43,255
mlnx distribution

621
02:01:46,904 --> 02:01:53,531
whoever free enterprise grade operating
system Alma means soul in Spanish

622
02:01:54,121 --> 02:02:01,111
okay if you say so

623
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:09,212
I'm going to let you money then it's more
than that I'm missing money that is more
than that

624
02:02:11,162 --> 02:02:15,210
but I accept their exclamation I take back
what I said

625
02:02:16,608 --> 02:02:20,881
unless I offend any Mormons God knows I
don't want to do that

626
02:02:25,553 --> 02:02:31,241
to do to do having been dormant for 42 years
it's my right to offend them

627
02:02:33,574 --> 02:02:41,507
I paid literally in cash for that right this
is a total guess

628
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:49,877
Elmo makes music 1:30 Turkish really is it
going to spawn a spawn a lawsuit

629
02:02:50,424 --> 02:02:53,970

630
02:02:56,233 --> 02:03:01,781
I I did guess I can't of the day I did I
honestly I did guess

631
02:03:02,919 --> 02:03:08,091
Shih Tzu bring me to can access

632
02:03:08,731 --> 02:03:16,576
this means I think I'm going to has not been
install Ed there is a package yet missing

633
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:23,650
it's up to read rhel yes security updates I
do remember this as well

634
02:03:24,942 --> 02:03:28,497
like if it's in those bills

635
02:03:30,797 --> 02:03:37,584
yeah unfortunately it is the thing to use in
the everybody hates that they made an
extreme but

636
02:03:38,148 --> 02:03:45,313
I hear what you're saying I sing a web 2

637
02:03:45,323 --> 02:03:52,492
I'm just taking a guess here sudu

638
02:04:01,730 --> 02:04:08,601
Sea-Doo package Army doing yum install

639
02:04:10,597 --> 02:04:13,825
I single web 2

640
02:04:14,549 --> 02:04:18,872
does it exist my guess was right

641
02:04:19,664 --> 02:04:25,604
right so now we have a single at 2 which
minutes

642
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:30,149
this this is probably going to work now

643
02:04:35,354 --> 02:04:38,011
yes please

644
02:04:39,832 --> 02:04:48,202

stable

645
02:04:48,872 --> 02:04:51,995

646
02:04:52,253 --> 02:05:07,563
you calling stream stream is is is is the is
the name of you use for ten toes but now it
was the best option for many reasons we have
different use cases and maybe about it yeah

647
02:05:07,859 --> 02:05:18,800
I think it says sorry I just have absolutely
everybody should do that but my question is
do you do you find it's compatible in more
ways than it with redhead stuff

648
02:05:20,288 --> 02:05:23,350
why the fuck is a phone out there

649
02:05:29,704 --> 02:05:33,406

want to see the wizard do it yourself

652
02:05:52,484 --> 02:05:53,501
huh

653
02:06:03,416 --> 02:06:05,329
where is all this shit

654
02:06:17,267 --> 02:06:19,635
I think I did it in the wrong spot

655
02:06:20,711 --> 02:06:32,891
fuck

656
02:06:37,778 --> 02:06:40,245
I had to have them application

657
02:06:48,681 --> 02:06:50,942
my scalp HP

658
02:06:58,245 --> 02:07:02,049
and is looking to put any any any of the
database stuff in here

659
02:07:04,847 --> 02:07:11,681
or missing something or missing something
and is getting is his writing on

660
02:07:13,562 --> 02:07:19,883
I have to have a running a single by the end
of the day or I'm leaving this behind and
I'll just use the docker file

661
02:07:20,734 --> 02:07:27,347
which might be faster anyway this is been an
occasional but I do not wish to do it
further

662
02:07:30,284 --> 02:07:36,078
later how do you install the icing a web
thing

663
02:07:38,793 --> 02:07:40,950
delayed compared to Reddit wow

664
02:10:33,478 --> 02:10:40,414
packages a good yeah I think so rpn

665
02:10:42,739 --> 02:10:43,932
mean

666
02:10:49,956 --> 02:10:52,451
222

667
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:59,785
do do do things to do

668
02:11:03,274 --> 02:11:09,629
I wish I had that was I mean does not update
installed package

669
02:11:10,187 --> 02:11:15,205
oh it's already been it's already installed
interesting pulled as a dependency

670
02:11:15,902 --> 02:11:23,879
W drama queen is now I cannot say

671
02:11:28,552 --> 02:11:35,093
I don't think that you needed I think I
think it gets pulled in by the mad at
automatically so I don't I'm not going to do
that

672
02:11:40,562 --> 02:11:44,482
I see will also require pspb at the soc
repository system

673
02:11:45,688 --> 02:11:51,815
there's a measure repossessing it right at 7
to rupture again blockchain

674
02:11:52,756 --> 02:12:05,188
if all the stories is selling package
generating I can pick her up to regenerate
ill-concealed and point-and-click wizard
yeah I try not to go through the wizard
thing so I don't know I guess

675
02:12:07,233 --> 02:12:13,852
release builds I think after this latest we
have this

676
02:12:15,378 --> 02:12:22,984
what time do the wrong thing I think I did

677
02:12:27,421 --> 02:12:33,797
I want to start running in here what did I
do, dammit

678
02:12:35,797 --> 02:12:43,090
yeah only maybe I have UPL release up here
and I didn't mean that I'll get him

679
02:12:48,404 --> 02:12:53,488
cursive Jerry says I think

680
02:12:55,079 --> 02:13:02,247
hey I think I'm overthinking it so I think 7

681
02:13:02,955 --> 02:13:05,268
only spells

682
02:13:11,974 --> 02:13:16,116
the same prebuilds I'm just trying to go
back to the packaged stuff

683
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:21,845
that's Anarchy this is what we did before

684
02:13:23,341 --> 02:13:27,346
yeah I think I think this is all installed
so

685
02:13:30,654 --> 02:13:32,536
let's go back

686
02:13:35,688 --> 02:13:41,687
a Davis gave him the problem is I can't find
an equivalent Davis gimme for postgres

687
02:13:41,688 --> 02:13:46,409
so that is bothering me

688
02:13:46,409 --> 02:13:52,362
the web server stuff in fact there isn't one
for my she will either

689
02:13:52,742 --> 02:13:57,913
and I'm feeling it's because I sing it
hasn't been properly installed you know I
mean

690
02:13:57,916 --> 02:14:01,484
I think it's because I think it hasn't been
installed I don't

691
02:14:01,484 --> 02:14:14,100
I think a single with two has been installed
so that's why I'm having a hard time I'm
having a hard time finding it and if this is
a chef cookbook so I mean

692
02:14:14,102 --> 02:14:22,658
there's that there's a nice girl to set up
me at that point I'm kind of like I want to
go to the doctor in a while and see what it
does

693
02:14:22,660 --> 02:14:27,816
and I'm and I'm going to do this I'm going
to make a bigger role for the

694
02:14:28,956 --> 02:14:36,754
I'm in this website up stuff I almost don't
even know if I needed but I kind of want to
do that

695
02:14:43,588 --> 02:14:46,130
I mean

696
02:14:47,163 --> 02:14:52,599
I don't know if she's resting group is
already done

697
02:14:53,082 --> 02:15:00,774
Curtis single web to configuration CD I
think I have the conservative figure x-ray

698
02:15:00,774 --> 02:15:08,355
the owner's permission if you want to create
the record manually look up structure
configurations

699
02:15:09,208 --> 02:15:15,763
I don't know it does say it's a dance at the
end of the daySundance at the end of the day
or so if you don't just give me it will fix
this automatically

700
02:15:16,982 --> 02:15:23,590
are you at that you think so all right well
a certain testing a database

701
02:15:26,704 --> 02:15:32,489
manual steps section of the stock and Skip
automated cuz it's the same thing you guys
are girls

702
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:36,450
well I have to because I wanted whole point
is to make it a bigger thing

703
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:44,093
I have that already

704
02:15:45,769 --> 02:15:47,535
I think I have it already

705
02:15:50,696 --> 02:16:02,843
I am pretty sure I have already I have it in
my my permission see I don't even know if
it's so far I don't know that it's not
working I'm just trying to find a point when
I was just trying to find this girl here

706
02:16:04,796 --> 02:16:07,226
this part I can definitely do

707
02:16:08,145 --> 02:16:14,361
our house is out for the PS4 that you are
Echo password your top secret password
password to phone

708
02:16:14,735 --> 02:16:28,106
so say up in a misdemeanor automatically
make sure you and I miss you all and you can
I feature is enabling it to it which I
already did I did this already. Patches X
config you did this already

709
02:16:30,093 --> 02:16:35,367
so you could take a picture or some
attention X I think that part sorry that
done too

710
02:16:35,779 --> 02:16:39,836
I actually think that that's doing a bunch
of I already did

711
02:16:41,253 --> 02:16:48,620
has been disconnected Vicki Docker compose
and decompose yes we're going to try it
darker to post next

712
02:16:50,558 --> 02:17:10,085
because I forgot that when I tried talking
to post on Friday converted to cure this
thing and failed last week and I know I do
not make her yesterday because I wanted to
bring up service and ignorant. Just as I
want to be able to bring up I want to be
with you Docker compose and I want to build
a vagrant

713
02:17:10,956 --> 02:17:18,961
so yeah but did you get me closer to my
goals I I need to do that

714
02:17:21,534 --> 02:17:26,255
I mean so it's not answer the web
installation stuff is kind of a pain in the
ass

715
02:17:27,192 --> 02:17:32,241
yeah did you forget I know I need to do
anything I need to be able to do is talk to
the API

716
02:17:32,242 --> 02:17:38,720
that's the only reason I give a shit so so
that's definitely the way to go I'm glad
that people make sure that's the second time

717
02:17:46,022 --> 02:17:48,180
so yeah

718
02:18:04,079 --> 02:18:06,963
all right so let's do

719
02:18:17,526 --> 02:18:20,198
Real Steel

720
02:18:21,950 --> 02:18:34,024
I say that I mean there's just too many
customization Subs here we got I mean I can
come back to it later it's not like you know
it's not like this is I mean if I actually
need to really get into icing I can do
better

721
02:18:41,094 --> 02:19:02,172
strike a pose. Which I put in the thing
there that was just change the settings I'm
going to have some dinner I'm going to come
back looking at you talking to pose because
the goal is to get to talk to it and another
reason to use chakra post I can actually
look at the doctor compose file and I don't
know why I would but I could actually

722
02:19:02,174 --> 02:19:05,323
use everything in the docker compose file

723
02:19:06,433 --> 02:19:10,253
I can already talk to it you think I can
hear you talk to right now

724
02:19:10,253 --> 02:19:18,275
yeah I was only able to text that I have to
like to Corona Post man or something

725
02:19:18,275 --> 02:19:35,052
right now I can act like this is good this
is good I mean this is not a failure right I
just I miss is my first big provisioning so
I'm glad you like me to leave this window
for a bit and come to something else I'm
going to go try that docker-compose for me
to switch gears

726
02:19:38,562 --> 02:19:49,013
let's try let's try to see if that provision
actually totally works with make sure we
don't have any really bad bolts in it that's
probably been like completely are free

727
02:19:50,350 --> 02:19:53,311
has been kind of niceit's been kind of nice
and destroy

728
02:19:57,055 --> 02:20:02,330
if you're all that should I set up a bigger
and I'm really glad that it works now that I
am

729
02:20:03,265 --> 02:20:09,443
I don't like a lot of the old Parts about it
and I'm willing to accept that

730
02:20:11,348 --> 02:20:16,141
latest dog figurines oh you found a vagrant
talk

731
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:22,989
look at you searching for the right thing
that I didn't look for

732
02:20:25,523 --> 02:20:30,180
I mean why should I not look at that I
should look for that first

733
02:20:31,082 --> 02:20:33,748
that is amazing thank you so much

734
02:20:35,507 --> 02:20:41,598
I think I'm going to even what so I can make
it a separate real

735
02:20:41,965 --> 02:20:44,202
yeah wow

736
02:20:49,413 --> 02:20:55,976
nice very very nice

737
02:21:02,342 --> 02:21:07,821
installing the colonel every time it does
that it takes longer every time

738
02:21:09,228 --> 02:21:12,719
there's an official vagrant box with
everything on it

739
02:21:12,892 --> 02:21:17,745
is it just what is that is that that's just
the web to box right

740
02:21:20,544 --> 02:21:22,526
that's the way to do it

741
02:21:22,974 --> 02:21:32,040
then we can just bring up a web to box and
then but does it have icing on it as well as
it have the rest API on it

742
02:21:34,155 --> 02:21:41,270
God damn that's cool well that's worth
looking at 2

743
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:44,276
it definitely worth looking at that I can
make my own

744
02:21:48,856 --> 02:21:52,898
all right this is dead she's dead Jim

745
02:21:52,926 --> 02:22:00,143
she said the terminal is dead on your
parents dead are they dead

746
02:22:00,249 --> 02:22:06,188
are they dead hurry or your parents dead I
love that line

747
02:22:07,243 --> 02:22:14,467
opening line of like the last Harry Potter
2nd of August I think actually know it is I
think it's an evil ass

748
02:22:21,062 --> 02:22:28,925
f 911 updates it's got every fucking Nadia's
model

749
02:22:29,599 --> 02:22:32,096
somebody already did all this work

750
02:22:34,812 --> 02:22:42,159
damn damn damn damn search commands for sit
missile attractions

751
02:22:42,406 --> 02:22:49,835
delete a machine folder that was a fail I do
repo demo and test baking stuff

752
02:22:50,219 --> 02:22:54,586
oh my God oh my God

753
02:22:55,176 --> 02:23:06,760
National resource up search for that this is
by the way another reason to use the old and
busted vagrant because there's lots of shit
out there about it going to use forever

754
02:23:12,574 --> 02:23:15,455
it said a package I sent it to

755
02:23:17,886 --> 02:23:21,308
yeah it's got

756
02:23:31,361 --> 02:23:38,480
filter you started seeing a service yeah we
we were added a bunch of stuff that's why I
want to roll it back

757
02:23:39,771 --> 02:23:42,506
Leah L operation

758
02:23:43,237 --> 02:23:50,941
every other from before can I change
register Home Bakery that's ever been fatal

759
02:23:52,465 --> 02:23:57,481
miss you on this is my own I saw that in
there

760
02:23:57,482 --> 02:24:01,147
I still have that stupid ass post wrestling
in there

761
02:24:03,311 --> 02:24:07,689
yeah there's a there's a family but I just
want to hear

762
02:24:08,903 --> 02:24:11,745
this doesn't exist

763
02:24:15,511 --> 02:24:18,454
and it doesn't exist

764
02:24:24,198 --> 02:24:32,082
everything else works yep we'll prove it I'm
going to prove I'm going to prove it

765
02:24:33,488 --> 02:24:39,023
now I'm going to save it and then I'm going
to do so I can post because it's just too
many moving parts

766
02:24:39,882 --> 02:24:46,661
oh I didn't work figuring up see if it comes
up now are we ready

767
02:24:47,824 --> 02:24:52,745
dinner's ready nice taco night Tuesday is
taco night

768
02:24:54,171 --> 02:25:01,163
I have a feeling this is going to work I I
have faith I have faith

769
02:25:08,385 --> 02:25:12,626
oh my God she open the door

770
02:25:13,091 --> 02:25:19,537
why have two tacos now I'm really hungry I
shall return

771
02:25:20,104 --> 02:25:23,234
and when you get out here was see ya

772
02:25:25,044 --> 02:25:33,829
we are going to do knock a really nice thing
to work by the end of the night I swear to
God I'm not going to go to bed

773
02:25:33,932 --> 02:25:38,469
until I can talk to the API

774
02:25:38,665 --> 02:25:53,274
bring me their current gold python or
Postman I need to be able to send a message
to a singer and I need to be able to know
how to do that and I don't have to depend on
the experts at work

775
02:25:57,815 --> 02:25:59,188
cell

776
02:26:04,398 --> 02:26:20,495
I think I was an hour ago that we got it to
work yeah I just wasn't able to actually
says that it's still here and still hear
alternator had it so there's two things
backpacks that you have experience with this
there's two things I need to be able to
check cuz we got the rest API to work right

777
02:26:20,497 --> 02:27:00,704
we need to be able to figure out we need to
be able to test sending a message to a
singer in the simplest possible way so we
can use it as a validation that it's working
that's the number one thing and the next
step from that is to encapsulate that into
something that can be run from within
kubernetes and I will be using any cute for
that so that's already got a thing file plus
mini Cube It's probably plenty as long as we
can get him to talk on the same IP networks
which I think is fine because I think
they're still I think they're all still
inside of the same Data Network so they
should be able to talk to each other without
a problem we can mess with never came later

778
02:27:01,896 --> 02:27:04,272
I single command not found

779
02:27:08,026 --> 02:27:14,722
still didn't do it what did I delete that
doesn't his hair

780
02:27:22,045 --> 02:27:24,213
postgres

781
02:27:25,634 --> 02:27:30,838
it's it's just the other another monitoring
tool there's a bunch of them and they're all
complicated

782
02:27:37,192 --> 02:27:39,673
are you getting that are from

783
02:27:42,541 --> 02:27:45,494
where did he get that are from

784
02:27:48,049 --> 02:27:54,661
sing it sing it, not found I just saw you
feel the install

785
02:27:55,708 --> 02:28:02,011
yeah I went to get it through it's pretty
cool yeah I'll text you the first message
from directory

786
02:28:04,111 --> 02:28:09,439
something didn't install that confirms me

787
02:28:12,564 --> 02:28:20,266
I understand what didn't install feel like
something didn't install

788
02:28:20,756 --> 02:28:23,801
all those Nadia's plugins

789
02:28:38,699 --> 02:28:41,574
I don't know

790
02:28:44,387 --> 02:28:51,630
do that now I want to know what I change
this is why if a cat wasn't created

791
02:28:51,630 --> 02:28:57,772
yeah but that that night has been working
since the very beginning so I'm really
confused

792
02:29:06,732 --> 02:29:10,964
that messed up is not working so again this
is why I look that we can do this

793
02:29:12,785 --> 02:29:17,895
so how it works or see if it works I'm sorry
singer

794
02:29:21,729 --> 02:29:28,231
you know it's just a rest if I delete
something I should know who sing I singer

795
02:29:38,253 --> 02:29:40,576
it's your view just skimming file

796
02:29:46,173 --> 02:29:49,304
this is working before though why is that
not working

797
02:30:00,408 --> 02:30:01,555
this

798
02:30:03,351 --> 02:30:11,505
there was definitely one PSU all file
install that did work the idea of stuff was
working at one point

799
02:30:13,166 --> 02:30:16,626
that stuff was was actually working at one
point

800
02:30:25,577 --> 02:30:30,186
I office is two months out of these two
lines I don't think that stopped it

801
02:30:30,923 --> 02:30:33,881
I'm pretty sure it works

802
02:30:36,883 --> 02:30:43,601
yeah it's probably are right now though I'ma
go eat tacos

803
02:30:47,102 --> 02:30:48,426
yeah

804
02:30:49,563 --> 02:30:57,985
that's another thing I can figure out the
only other thing I messed with was the
package list and it showed me that I hadn't
shifted since my last commit so

805
02:31:02,571 --> 02:31:09,769
I mean let me get luck Aunt Tiff provision

806
02:31:11,641 --> 02:31:14,831
yeah I haven't made any changes to this file

807
02:31:18,228 --> 02:31:24,503
get history they get long it's getting right

808
02:31:25,071 --> 02:31:29,569
what is it I have a shortcut for this I
don't use a remote

809
02:31:37,316 --> 02:31:40,050
that's the only one okay

810
02:31:45,106 --> 02:31:55,360
yeah I think it's fine

811
02:31:55,490 --> 02:32:02,526
I think it's fine all right there so that
you write or something or some other as
girls going on

812
02:32:03,766 --> 02:32:11,281
I think I am not completely sure it's not a
timing thing I guess it wait before
something else finishes you know

813
02:32:12,473 --> 02:32:19,673
cuz sometimes it's like totally green and
others is not it's never taken this long by
the way

814
02:32:21,645 --> 02:32:29,576
I wonder if I'm killing my machine holyshit
God damn I'm glad I came down really fast

815
02:32:30,958 --> 02:32:33,887
got to go to the key moves I got running

816
02:32:33,931 --> 02:32:40,501
I got tons of libert Q is running what the
fuck I like I like hung or something

817
02:32:44,998 --> 02:32:52,482
am I singing leaving or default I'm a senior
center phone

818
02:32:53,096 --> 02:32:58,711
I'll probably stop those hey look we go
again

819
02:33:02,176 --> 02:33:07,827
it is he going to have no idea where to send
let's let's do this okay

820
02:33:10,125 --> 02:33:15,368
send link that was the I know what that
command was

821
02:33:15,369 --> 02:33:18,136
that was this one right here

822
02:33:20,756 --> 02:33:28,373
so that means it's not getting to here yeah

823
02:33:30,413 --> 02:33:33,741
nothing that's not good actually

824
02:33:34,051 --> 02:33:40,176
that's not good because that that's that's
bad that's why

825
02:33:41,688 --> 02:33:47,628
your Service registration over here so you
about the install didn't work

826
02:33:48,629 --> 02:33:51,213
and I'm not sure what

827
02:33:52,617 --> 02:34:04,533
yeah alright well I mean I know I'm this is
a real shot in the dark has a lot of complex
pieces are we we got it working pretty good
so

828
02:34:05,579 --> 02:34:12,700
this enables not working so that's that's
kind of problem I'm from it I'm going to
prove it

829
02:34:21,273 --> 02:34:28,298
she is our person see its provision this was
just a warning. Is there this morning it was
actually up

830
02:34:32,718 --> 02:34:37,480
yeah negron3 load that that provision

831
02:34:40,703 --> 02:34:45,837
graceful shutdown for imports

832
02:34:47,913 --> 02:34:53,735
SSH address say there's a red dress paperie
one what do I do

833
02:34:54,770 --> 02:35:00,533
I live in a cessation of the McLean that's
kind of cool I mean obviously it needs it

834
02:35:08,279 --> 02:35:10,752
he's really all those packages cells

835
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:23,560
I guess I guess it does reinstall the
packages every time your permission I
shouldn't have to though

836
02:35:25,337 --> 02:35:35,492
that's good to know that because we need
that when you're even afford SS permission
that means it still runs through all the
packaging cells even in they need to be
aware of death checking for something
already exist by chance

837
02:35:58,578 --> 02:36:01,141
it should be inside so it's not a patchy

838
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:10,156
well we know we had to Indiana choice right

839
02:36:12,773 --> 02:36:17,573
I have the item PS your packages up Saline I
do have that

840
02:36:20,304 --> 02:36:23,229
oh well that works

841
02:36:24,759 --> 02:36:29,285
I act I am now I'm almost positive it was a
timing issue

842
02:36:29,310 --> 02:36:33,138
I'm almost positive I think what happened
was is script

843
02:36:33,216 --> 02:36:39,276
try to go on to the next thing and it did
the other things weren't set up we needed
was some positives and there was something

844
02:36:39,321 --> 02:36:49,866
see it's like restart the Dayman it's
actually all working now so that's good to
know I got to put it a little thing in here

845
02:36:50,555 --> 02:36:53,954
I even a warning in here

846
02:36:56,373 --> 02:37:03,808
fix me there are definitely on timing issues

847
02:37:03,833 --> 02:37:07,002
and this script

848
02:37:07,002 --> 02:37:14,729
sometimes it works sometimes not depending
on delays

849
02:37:16,729 --> 02:37:21,129
excetera so I will come back and fix it
another day

850
02:37:23,042 --> 02:37:28,671
possibly I always want to have an event like
what did I do

851
02:37:30,876 --> 02:37:39,797
yep it was a productive I learned a lot I
missed the first time I've done a bigger
provision of any kind

852
02:37:39,797 --> 02:37:58,102
I realize the whole time you think it's a
thing it actually kind of makes me want to
break down some of the steps in vagrant so
that they when they step completes then do
the next step out of feeling baby does that
and I'm done I'm coming to you right now she
said angrily

853
02:37:58,105 --> 02:38:02,064
I have set unless pissed

854
02:38:07,450 --> 02:38:11,225
bye-bye I think I'll

855
02:55:25,270 --> 02:55:31,626
hello we just found out that our insurance
is not going to cover

856
02:55:31,865 --> 02:55:38,999
the car rental after we got rear-ended my
wife got rear-ended we have to redo the car

857
02:55:39,953 --> 02:55:42,249
and they refused to pay

858
02:55:43,001 --> 02:55:52,710
for the extra days of car rental because
it's taking too long to fix it we have to
pay like five $600 out of her own pocket for
something it's not our fault

859
02:55:54,763 --> 02:55:56,508
God Bless America

860
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:08,443
that's why my wife is in a in a bad mood she
gets rear-ended could have died

861
02:56:09,010 --> 02:56:15,690
buy a semi on an on-ramp the insurance

862
02:56:16,094 --> 02:56:36,512
pays for us to get a new to get the frame of
the car fixed the frame got tweaked it
wasn't just the it wasn't just the the
bumper was actually the frame got to be so
now we have to pay for I think I'm going out
to people that their insurance is paying for
that but but but their insurance is only
paying for 30 days of car rental and they
haven't fixed the car

863
02:56:36,514 --> 02:56:39,611
and so now we have to wait for another

864
02:56:39,780 --> 02:56:51,094
20 days and we have to choose to have no car
at all when my wife has a higher opening in
Charlotte or we have to pay $25 a day for
car rental

865
02:56:51,684 --> 02:56:54,181
we have no other option

866
02:56:59,290 --> 02:57:06,440
imagine if I was still trying to work for
myself and I didn't have insurance and I was
trying to be a self-employed entrepreneur

867
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:28,169
why do you think I sold out and went to
Corporate America because you even even
working for a corporate America doing the
the no choice kind of life that American
forces on you working for some big company
that that the 1% of proves up if you still
get fucked you still get fucked

868
02:57:29,111 --> 02:57:45,655
whether you're a student who's got a two
thousand two hundred thousand dollars with a
dead and no job prospects or Yosemite gets
randomly rear end and all the sudden have to
pay $600 out of your own pocket for nothing
that you did that was wrong out of yours
have your own even if you had insurance

869
02:57:46,371 --> 02:57:56,447
maybe we could go to like we do like if we
get the money for him are you going to sue
them for $700 I can pay a lawyer $3,000 to
even get a retainer so I can do the lawsuit

870
02:57:56,925 --> 02:58:07,406
you know the people that fly around at the
upper 1% level at 8.01% into having a care
in the world because I have so much money
and they don't pay any taxes at all and

871
02:58:07,945 --> 02:58:13,059
it's just it's insane it's insanely bad I'm
kind of pissed off in fact I'm done

872
02:58:12,044 --> 02:58:28,304
in fact I'm done playing games I'm done I'm
done going for tonight fuck it you ain't you
at this makes me do this kind of shit that
goes down like this. Does this is why people
turn to Crime I'm not a I'm not saying I'm
going to turn to gripe but this is why they
do turn to crime

873
02:58:29,024 --> 02:58:40,037
this is why people turn to crime and people
turn to Crime because they feel desperate
they feel like they've been cheated by the
system and my my wife actually used to work
in security

874
02:58:40,976 --> 02:58:43,141
erratic Eliza's them

875
02:58:43,498 --> 02:59:15,246
me because they feel like the system is fuck
them over a feel like that they're going to
take it on every visit ended up killing
innocent people I'm not going to do that
don't worry know anybody right but that's
what they need to do because they get that
the system has fuck them over and over and
over and over at they've tried to play by
the system they try to do everything right
they've had to let you know that the 763
credit score of the whole life they've done
all the things that the mainstream World
tells you to do because it benefits the
people in power

876
02:59:15,251 --> 02:59:25,770
until it doesn't and it when they wake up
and get unplugged from The Matrix they're
like what the fuc and then they go Neo on
everybody's ass or they go V4 vagrant you
know

877
02:59:26,993 --> 02:59:41,003
they just they do or they do something more
subtle it's okay fine I'm going to play this
game but I'm going to play it in a way that
no one is going to identify I'm going to be
subtle about it

878
02:59:41,415 --> 03:00:03,023
and that's my choice my choice is DeSoto
away and the subtle way means working for a
big fucking couch he asked company and
playing the game playing the game doing
exactly what they say as much shit is from
them as I can because I ain't they do me
fucking anything and I can go anywhere else
I want to go and I can go work anywhere else

879
03:00:05,056 --> 03:00:29,809
so when there's an opportunity for me to
Robin Hood from the 14 said I do and in my
way and nothing I do is illegal nothing I do
is illegal is all completely within the
boundary of the law working for the company
that I work for just being on their payroll
feels dirty to me because it's so that such
a fucking inflated crazy as celery and I
work hard I work hard I'll give you the
wrong but

880
03:00:29,812 --> 03:00:39,902
the whole system's rigged and email me what
can you imagine trying to be a teacher in
this yet she's being a public school teacher
on 40K a year 46 EK are going through all of
this

881
03:00:39,903 --> 03:00:45,365
my wife could even exist she's an artist you
can even exist without this

882
03:00:45,366 --> 03:00:53,772
the whole system is just totally fucked and
so what happens is you people sorry I was
listening to her rossmanngroup you know him
right

883
03:00:53,773 --> 03:01:17,677
oh so you didn't talk about this last night
at like 2 a.m. I was just like watching and
he's he's down to he's like yeah I put all
these people that played by the covet system
like a I did my thing I close my shop I did
everything I was supposed to and it's not
working and now he's getting kind of
concerned he's like no I'm just going to
open my shop. I want to get covid-19 zhing

884
03:01:17,942 --> 03:01:58,737
so let's write books about hockey capitals
and yeah so I'm trying to say so it's it's
there's many many ways to revolt against the
system it's what I'm trying to say some of
them are more overt some of them involve
playing classical music while you blow up
British Parliament building you know quiet
access like whatever there's all different
layers and and I am not a revolutionary I
have revolutionary my blood for sure

885
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:04,119
but but I if anything I think it's a

886
03:02:04,119 --> 03:02:46,731
I think you know I always missed her feel
guilty for like like sliding through a stop
sign and I was the guy that like because I
thought I was going to go to hell I
literally thought I was going to go but
didn't follow the letter of the law to those
Mormon I was like hey I have got to press my
break and I have to come to a complete stop
or I am going to all of society's going to
collapse right and it took me I didn't get
to my forties or fifties until I realize
that civil disobedience is the thing civil
disobedience is a thing it's a real thing
it's an ethical thing and and there are lots
of ways to do it I'm waiting for the moment
to launch his Society program

887
03:02:46,737 --> 03:02:53,032
well actually one of them at one of the most
important lessons from from mr. robot and
its Society is that their Revolution was a
massive failure

888
03:02:51,869 --> 03:03:15,930
massive failure that's like probably the
central message of the whole hacker part of
that series is that what they did was a
fucking totally horrible mistake and and
Elliott practically comes out and says what
the right way to do this is it gives you
kind of a recipe and he I can on a play it

889
03:03:16,679 --> 03:03:20,192
and became mean yeah he

890
03:03:20,476 --> 03:04:04,121
when Elliot goes to work for fsociety
because he's going to get money in the US to
figure out how to deal with the inside stuff
he I've said this before a million times he
realizes the secret the secret is to use the
power and energy of of evil Corp against
itself and to change it from within that
means buying into the system that means
being a spy on the inside that means you go
in you you trojan horse that shit you get in
there you know you had access to stuff you
can take down the evil from within and you
don't have to do anything illegal in the
morning.

891
03:04:04,123 --> 03:04:06,947
Being corrupted by the masses

892
03:04:07,700 --> 03:04:38,614
like it like that yeah like at Utica exactly
you just you take you just returned their
energy against them and that that is I
cannot wait to read Hagan capitalism because
that's I think was with the first of that is
Annette that that is the secret the secret
the secret to owning American capitalism in
particular and the backup system that we
lived in is to use all that power against it
by by

893
03:04:38,617 --> 03:04:42,075
buying into it so

894
03:04:42,445 --> 03:04:50,194
the secret I'm going to say it again this is
the hard part is you have to remember I
remember Angela remember Angela mr. robot

895
03:04:50,390 --> 03:05:02,200
Angela is a cautionary tale about what
happens when you try to do this and you fail
because you get sucked into it

896
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:05,821
so it goes into it and

897
03:05:05,822 --> 03:06:00,759
he's able to keep his his thing together
right there there's a lot of real deep
symbolism that that the episode where they
don't there's like a one taken have this
amazing one take episode of mr. robot it is
so phenomenal one take episode of mr. robot
and there is a moment there where Angela and
Elliot have been separated for a long time
and now it has been an NN Angela has been
like pulled down her path and but eventually
she forced to do things that she doesn't
want to do and she's been removed from your
house she's home in control on and then she
has to face off with Elliot to get her thing
done her hair cuz she has to do done and she
doesn't realize it but she's actually she's
actually still a pain of the whole system
and she's totally being manipulated and
Elliot is still independent because you know
he's The Mastermind

898
03:06:00,766 --> 03:06:33,470
and I'm not going to give the whole thing
away but they're there's this scene when
they come together and I haven't seen each
other for a long time and Angela is the
personification of somebody who went
undercover so to speak it to try to own the
system and got totally railroaded by it she
got sucked into it she doesn't even know
what she's bought into the whole mentality
of it she's decided to think that she's you
know I'll take I'll try the products next I
don't know who you think you're talking to
but I'll try the products next

899
03:06:33,473 --> 03:06:43,325
how do you work for them is this blood on
your shoes how do you work for them I don't
know who you think you're talking to but
I'll try the products next

900
03:06:43,642 --> 03:07:03,531
that's Angela getting totally sucked in and
everybody knows nice shoes right everybody
knows what happened to her that isn't
cautionary tale of what happens when you try
to go in and turn the power against them and
you get sucked into the power the power
takes you over that's what she that's her
story

901
03:07:03,533 --> 03:07:20,135
and I always always story is he goes in
there and he does a bunch of successful
things but then he realizes all the other
stuff is up there that he got wrong and that
he had that he totally fucked up it so now
he has to kind of figure it out you know

902
03:07:20,137 --> 03:07:21,797
cell

903
03:07:21,797 --> 03:07:32,802
it's very interesting stuff i i b b the
secret The Secret of fighting back in my
opinion is unfortunately playing by the
rules

904
03:07:31,720 --> 03:07:35,735
show me playing by the rules you know what
one of the rules is

905
03:07:36,647 --> 03:07:42,196
I have to have a fucking smartphone in this
Society if I don't have a smartphone

906
03:07:42,949 --> 03:07:45,089
I cannot compete

907
03:07:46,442 --> 03:08:11,483
and let's be real I tried this for 2 years I
tried to stay outside of the system I try to
say I don't want to buy into it I want to
have this there's such right I want to be
your toes store Toy Story on it on it on my
own and be outside of the system everything
doesn't work try to do anything without a
smartphone now consider that half the world
how do they do anything

908
03:08:13,406 --> 03:08:18,227
cyberpunk mode absolutely I'm almost there

909
03:08:20,725 --> 03:08:27,986
so you know where's my pet my EpiPen
probably bugged

910
03:08:29,984 --> 03:08:32,997
but you know that's the bottom line is

911
03:08:34,465 --> 03:08:42,919
you have to hack the system you have to in
order to fight against the system and it's
like it's like dormammu

912
03:08:43,999 --> 03:08:47,008
can't even have a drive without a smartphone
I know

913
03:08:47,008 --> 03:08:58,183
it's like this is nobody's asking whether I
should be done or not there nobody is asking
whether we wanted power windows or not I
want to machine it when a car doesn't have
it I don't know if I'll get him

914
03:08:58,269 --> 03:09:14,849
so you know but the thing is you're if
you're going to fight against the system you
have to use the power of the system against
itself the whole door mom with and you know
and that also said there's Marvel Marvel has
that same thing right that that the the
keeper lets her face

915
03:09:15,367 --> 03:09:50,099
Tilda Swinton it whatever it is you know the
one in in where she was going to come out
again right so the timekeeper eye doctor
strange in her secret is that she's using
the dark energy to fight against Dark Energy
the ancient one right like the fakir Library
owner hell yeah it's only did it a I just
think it's an asshole for how we did it is
it ain't going to make a statement that they
never would ever be about he did it but I
don't think you did it well

916
03:09:50,102 --> 03:09:54,219
right so the ancient one yeah

917
03:09:54,220 --> 03:10:29,872
Nation won the message from the ancient one
is she she understood that to fight it you
have to take some of it in and understand it
and use it against itself but you have to
stay pure and the door holder Mama extract
the other people who were hungry for the
power those with the Angelo's so you see
these plotlines a lot all the time it's like
I'm going to take some of the darkness to
fight against the darkness and then that you
have I mean I'm sure my steps I would have a
whole bunch to say about Dark Souls

918
03:10:29,873 --> 03:10:55,220
Dark Souls as you know they're all dead
there are fighting against there's there's a
lot of plot lines that have this in them in
fact including you know a lot of the Star
Wars stuff all the Star Wars stuff
definitely the Battlestar Galactica stuff
Battlestar Galactica there's there's there's
a point at which you know you have to use
the power against it that the tricky part is
is it how do you like gold wielder Lord of
the Rings

919
03:10:55,226 --> 03:11:01,486
I mean come on I would use this power for
good

920
03:11:01,487 --> 03:11:10,979
the reason the reason that they had to
destroy the ring I actually I feel like I
feel like Tolstoy was that's also why I feel
like

921
03:11:10,979 --> 03:11:56,177
I feel like talkin she was by the way a
really staunch Christian yeah he is CS Lewis
used to go on walks and talks about
Christianity he was actually converted c.s.
Lewis to Christianity poking at Oxford
converted is more less c.s. Lewis to
Christianity before they would even run
anything and they would walk around the
grounds and talk about Christianity and
stuff and I think that that's one of the
reasons that there's not a little bit more
subtlety in Lord of the Rings Lord of the
Rings is kind of Dickens tale and dick is
very Christian to write it's very black and
white here either this or that you're either
good or bad to go by there a b c right now
or whenever it's like very but but because

922
03:11:56,183 --> 03:12:13,032
Derek date it was really bad at least did
Jefferson like when when Gandalf says don't
ever offer the ring to me freely I would
seek to use the ring to do good but through
a power but through me it would will the
power so terrible and horrible that

923
03:12:11,789 --> 03:12:20,768
and horrible that they do and it is true
because he would he would take it on and say
Hey I want to take this power and I'm going
to use this power for good

924
03:12:21,337 --> 03:12:22,470
but

925
03:12:22,905 --> 03:12:31,336
u-prep Gandalf the whole world as he magic
can you imagine if Gandalf in fall into the
ring

926
03:12:31,473 --> 03:12:41,657
that's like an alternate ending I want to
see the alternate ending I want to see his
where is where Frodo says no here really
Gandalf take it I don't want it

927
03:12:42,883 --> 03:13:09,183
I got off okay and he takes it and puts it
on and then the rest is like history that
would be so phenomenally awesome I would
love to see that I would I would love to see
that also has some here they do that because
some of the Marvel stuff on Disney they play
around with different timelines I want to
see the Gandalf actually takes the one ring
it's just fine okay I'll go to the store and
you put it on Kenny just can't come back

928
03:13:09,186 --> 03:13:13,530
but you're too much power and so

929
03:13:14,036 --> 03:13:26,677
I don't know it it takes us to a certain
type of person to to be able to use it to
take on the power and be able to not get not
become evil from the power

930
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:32,302
but I think I feel much less guilt than I
used to before

931
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:43,113
I was riddled with guilt everyday all the
time when I was Mormon every single little
thing I did I would my my brother I probably
shouldn't say this

932
03:13:43,463 --> 03:14:21,970
I mean I do so anyway my brother's my
brother struggled with it to how about I'll
put that out there much more than I did to
the point where it affected his life because
you think you could just fuck you up a
constructive so bad just living every day
with guilt guilt about this guilt about that
guilt about every law I did and then goes
about being late to a meeting guilt about
not doing my my my church calling the way I
might have needed to you know ironically not
as much guilt about the things I probably
should have felt guilty about like working
too hard or

933
03:14:21,974 --> 03:14:29,491
you know spending time with my family.
Enough of that and I know that it was ironic
because they keep saying her about families
and then they make you so busy I make time
to be with your family

934
03:14:30,940 --> 03:14:35,808
it sound yeah it's a

935
03:14:35,808 --> 03:14:45,610
was Incorruptible even he was on the verge
of failing yeah he almost did he would have
felt like I had the door the Rings about Sam

936
03:14:45,723 --> 03:14:55,017
did you hear from teaching exactly how my
God the guilt over home teaching

937
03:14:55,560 --> 03:14:58,666
you know if your water is still you know
nothing about

938
03:14:58,666 --> 03:15:04,571
we we should have everything. I am talking
too fast I'm sorry I'll talk slower

939
03:15:05,662 --> 03:15:11,692
I'll talk more slowly acting box is saying
I'm talking too fast in Russian

940
03:15:11,693 --> 03:15:32,188
he didn't have any major Ambitions or power
to begin with which it was I think would
help him but still has to be sent here that
evidence for Sam being the true hero the
true protagonist of the whole thing is the
final scene the final scene of the book has
salmon it not Frodo

941
03:15:33,782 --> 03:15:37,426
think about that one for a second that go
read it

942
03:15:38,918 --> 03:15:47,041
the protagonist of Lord of the Rings the
strongest hero in protagonist was actually
Sam

943
03:15:47,336 --> 03:16:00,822
guilt about being opportunistic yeah I mean
guilt about working for a job or I'm making
crazy insane amounts of money compared to
somebody else who definitely deserves the
money more than me for what they do

944
03:16:01,854 --> 03:16:33,868
Society has chosen to Value certain things
but other things and it really weird-ass way
and and you know that can fill out of us who
killed others that we can just accept it
some people actually capitalize on it then I
go hey I'm a female I'm picking up females
here I'm the female women pay for sex I'm
going to sell sex and then it makes sense of
any of that I know people who do this and
I'm at people that I consider respectable
people

945
03:16:33,869 --> 03:16:50,923
very does it some of them have made the
conscious decision to use their body to make
money then conscious decision to do it they
they it's like it's like that's one
particular case I mean there's men who do
this to actually tell one of them to

946
03:16:51,784 --> 03:16:57,444
women pay for sexwomen pay for sex and Men
pay for sex yeah my point is is that

947
03:16:58,625 --> 03:17:21,978
more and more people have realized that the
systems fucked up so they use the system
against itself and they're like I am going
to take the world has decided to reward this
thing I hate the role is done that but I'm
going to make my money in that thing and I'm
going to get out how many how many actresses
I'm picking women here I'm sorry but you
know

948
03:17:22,477 --> 03:17:30,324
it's a thing is it I feel like I feel like a
lot of them were so beaten down Isaac I
would really like to ask my wife about this

949
03:17:30,495 --> 03:17:36,418
was it one of her opinions on this being a
woman and having Grace in it now

950
03:17:36,976 --> 03:17:44,066
my phone is dead you know they're there are
definitely

951
03:17:44,507 --> 03:18:06,775
women who have accepted the fact that the
system is really fucked up and if there's
somebody who wants to Ravel and and
eventually play the system against itself I
can really see that being woman very easily
given what I know about but I've been
sitting with my my wife studying what what
women have been through I don't know why I
could never relate to that but

952
03:18:06,988 --> 03:18:14,610
that you don't want people asking for this
way people who have been really repressed
and really

953
03:18:15,313 --> 03:18:18,970
I think frankly stepped on by a society

954
03:18:19,425 --> 03:18:25,196
they tend to to give you an earlier and then
I can know what

955
03:18:26,825 --> 03:19:01,560
I'm going to be a gold digger I'm going to
be this I'm going to be I'm not going to be
a teacher I'm going to go be a private
instructor I'm not going to be a professor
of mathematics anymore I'm going to go work
for the spin tech company make three times
the money and I'm not going to feel guilty
about it I'm not contributing back to the
world as much who gives a shit because
because they said they start to get greedy
greedy because why because the system is
told him that they don't matter unless they
play by those rules are like fine I'll go
play by the rules I get really big on to get
fuck you money Genesis talk about this all
the time he's the first one who told me
about fucking money I'm going to get fuck
you money then I'm going to go back and I'm
going to fix the system

956
03:19:01,566 --> 03:19:19,029
I need to go back in a minute that donate
all of my time and energy I get a sense that
Striker has fucking money but I don't know
it straight to him right now or is it
supposed to be streaming tonight he's going
to do something to make tonight I really
like Stryker I watch how he helps people
Allianz onto yep plan on starting up

957
03:19:21,764 --> 03:19:28,362
antler Leon to come let you know class of 03
6,000 people

958
03:19:28,363 --> 03:19:30,983
watching Leon right now

959
03:19:31,256 --> 03:19:38,757
weenie is Privateer Pakistani bull mini
answer

960
03:19:39,013 --> 03:19:45,628
when is Privateer significance is the
minimum wage in Minnesota

961
03:19:45,751 --> 03:19:48,938
I don't know if I understand that

962
03:19:51,492 --> 03:20:07,556
I said yeah and you must be at least forty
years yeah yeah that makes sense

963
03:20:07,556 --> 03:20:11,065
and it went as rigorous triggers brilliant

964
03:20:11,066 --> 03:20:27,638
I got nothing to say negative about that at
all especially now that's hacking capitalism
and I think it will fix violence and tell
you it will change yourself oh right right
right we need to drive to the city in your
pocket so many boots women Elsa

965
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:37,915
I got to remember that one we need Friday to
Vinny's private investor Dania when is
private and how many bullets you mean yes
sir.

966
03:20:37,915 --> 03:20:48,093
Tfue Nas Nasir Nasir Nasir nailo Nasir Nasir
in the city

967
03:20:48,094 --> 03:20:55,925
how can anyone pay attention to get advice
with that many packet without that many
partaking 6K I don't know

968
03:20:57,219 --> 03:21:30,471
I mean you know he has a different format
and and I told you I really I really likely
on his support of his has a much much
different style and I don't think you like
the main thing but I support the motivation
for everything he's doing a really do
understand that some people are saying and
you know if you'd rather be here complaining
about the system in figuring out how to hack
capitalism you're in the right place it
going b key

969
03:21:30,476 --> 03:21:37,525
yeah yeah yeah I just I don't know I

970
03:21:38,721 --> 03:21:40,237
then give an example

971
03:21:41,370 --> 03:22:01,149
if the system says you have to have a piece
of paper from a college accredited college
to get a job then you go to the Community
College or you go to WGU in America you pay
her $67,000 to get the minimum credential
you can get you learn everything you need to
get a job and then you say fuck you system

972
03:22:02,551 --> 03:22:04,046
that's what you do

973
03:22:06,227 --> 03:22:35,135
you don't say it you don't buy into the
system that says you you don't matter unless
you go to college and by the way you have to
go to a good college what's a good college
won with 60% of it in that 60% Legacy which
means people don't even have to take a test
to get in they just get in there because of
their parents and then they may come away
with no debt because their parents are
probably donors of the college those are the
good colleges you fucking kidding me are you
fucking kidding me

974
03:22:35,148 --> 03:22:46,683
there's there anything but the good cards
but you know who goes to work there all the
really talented smart professors because
they make Bank there they get tender and
they make so much money and make the fuck
you money

975
03:22:47,554 --> 03:22:54,198
and he convinced the whole world that that's
the best place to go to school and you don't
matter unless you go to a good school

976
03:22:56,047 --> 03:23:02,616
I got that control but if you need to get
that piece of paper you get it and then you
show him what you're good for you prove it

977
03:23:04,356 --> 03:23:10,343
but this isn't a Docker container which one
do the whole thing

978
03:23:10,875 --> 03:23:15,534

glowing

1010
03:28:06,091 --> 03:28:27,114
neon in the back of Anjali but at some point
you like the information and in the content
in the community is way more important than
when I look like or how clean the
presentation is and whether have a cutscene
or whether I have a transition although I
will say this emotes matter and I need a
fact maybe I should work on the boat right
now

1011
03:28:27,117 --> 03:28:31,249

like we have to find a whole bunch of
symbols

1248
04:05:12,762 --> 04:05:19,582
I don't even know if you're going to be here
because it's at this time and it's not part
of this particular Quest

rats you know what I almost feel like

1303
04:12:51,885 --> 04:13:09,510
I almost feel like I feel like my my
computer is backwards I'm trying to run away
and it's the key was not doing it it's like
I'm trying to run away and it's not doing it
I'm like literally pushing back right now
and my w is on and I'm not running away

1304
04:13:10,001 --> 04:13:13,213
I have no idea what's going on I feel like

1305
04:13:16,912 --> 04:13:22,094
it's like a it's like I'm crouching or some
shit like I push something on accident I'm
crashing now

1306
04:13:26,037 --> 04:13:32,556
I want to send I could have got put
something on wrong again

1307
04:13:36,339 --> 04:13:39,834
I do I think I think make it look I'm not
now nothing's happening

1308
04:13:40,320 --> 04:13:46,894
yeah I definitely have sort of some sort of
controller lag look watch

1309
04:13:49,184 --> 04:13:54,708
yeah oh hey look a I drink I drink Stout

1310
04:13:56,167 --> 04:13:59,544
it's fixed out now I can't see that I'm
drunk

1311
04:14:00,867 --> 04:14:07,969
It's time I stopped and put the game down
its rap

1312
04:14:11,043 --> 04:14:14,105
this is what I understand is it

1313
04:14:16,804 --> 04:14:22,324
something about the movement has changed and
I I don't know what it's like when I when I
broke the running thing

1314
04:14:23,899 --> 04:14:29,081
normally I can double tap forward and it
goes fast right it doesn't

1315
04:14:29,154 --> 04:14:36,490
it is because I have too much warmer I think
it might because I have too much armor

1316
04:14:38,163 --> 04:14:41,697
I sent him I said I said how much stuff

1317
04:14:41,904 --> 04:14:46,747
I think I think I think being might because
he would like I think it might actually

1318
04:14:48,640 --> 04:14:56,630
no I don't want that I'm not a mind cover
damn I am I encumbered

1319
04:15:00,232 --> 04:15:05,835
I think it's I think I'm I think I
definitely have input lag I think it's
what's happening

1320
04:15:07,227 --> 04:15:13,399
but did you see how I can't run oh I am or

1322
04:15:23,670 --> 04:15:28,354

I was having trouble

1323
04:15:28,609 --> 04:15:33,873
