1
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:13,150

check one two

3
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:28,168
that's why I said all the Raiders off the
The Forgotten vcr and then they they stopped

4
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:30,965
self

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,123
I guess I'm just just just just to relax

6
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:53,235
second trying to supplement

7
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:13,153
I'm just relaxing oh shit that's right where
in down in this dungeon here

8
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,688
fuck so hard level I forgot about that

9
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:40,557
what do we have to do here and explore the
ruins and find the swallow symbols we found
the first one

10
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:54,418
yeah we found the first fall symbol is right
there I think so I think so Kara

11
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,660
all right well let's go see what else we can
do here

00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:11,234
I need a light or something wait where's my
torch where's my torch

her carry do you help

16
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,226
a Cara Cara hey

17

22
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,971
I have a very bad feeling about this

23
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:33,964
I have a bad feeling about this it's going
to happen

24
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,067
wandering in the dark you give me damn ride

I think you're right I'mma light you on fire
my torch

27
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:58,621

110
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:03,223
oh hey buddy holy shit that's a lot of stuff

111
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:09,935
I might actually do a lot more crafting this
time too I didn't do any crafting last time
anel

112
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,593
I didn't I didn't really do much crafting
last time

113
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:44,875
the crafty 4 armor sets yeah I didn't do any
crafting at some of the crap you could do is
pretty amazing I want to do that before I
like go for the mods you know

114
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:51,549
people people like jump for the mods kind of
early I guess Chris has a really good modded
outfit

115
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:54,596
I I wanted to Tris line to

116
00:16:56,274 --> 00:17:08,104
yeah I know I was so disappointed I didn't
buy it I was so disappointed I was so into
it I thought it was going to be so awesome
and it really wasn't

117
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:20,390
I feel bad about that I do it could have
been so amazing to you it wasn't don't have
a storyline to try to roughly do the others
for the reason which was so great it's got a
really great plot

118
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:25,620
my pinion which is the only game that's made
me cry

119
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:44,857
the first run-through of Witcher I cried my
eyes that I got like a little snowflake baby
I I was so moved by the whole story line
between him and his daughter and then did
the tirade that destroyed us about standing
for something I just really got to me

120
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:52,103
I feel a nard coming on that's not hard or
is it hard

121
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:59,722
nope oh it's a climber thingy one of my
torch

122
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:08,440
it's not AAA title now it's really not I I
don't think it is

123
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:13,412
and I'm dying to Gears of War series yes

124
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:17,269
yes my

125
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:29,579
oh Astrid all the books she's she's the real
kind of sore she we were all into the games
and she read the books and she's she's like
Fountain of Knowledge when it comes to
Witcher

126
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:54,079
yeah you can spend we were going to get
there you're going to throw yourself in me
and I have to decide what to do about that

127
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,157
but a diversity of cp2

128
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:29,334
yeah that's one of the reasons I don't like
Dark Souls actually I just also I don't like
the look of this game the look of the game
is to my wife says it has too much black
into the ER at 2 in was too dark it's like
which are the which is just it's just
beautiful sister the sky that everything is
just gorgeous

129
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:55,327
guys considering look for it look at a wall
for like 10 minutes it's just got so much
detail in it you know it's it's just
everything that I always dreamed I was a kid
I mean playing his other games we knew it
one day that was going to be a
photo-realistic games at some point and
which is pretty damn close to it I mean it's
a bad winter in 2022 I can't even did you
see that they're going to do a cosmetic
upgrade for Witcher 3

130
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,657
somebody told me about that

131
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:05,970
it's actually his benches not to say no I'm
not quite it's great though

132
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:15,795
I love that they gave the call for adventure
in Ready Player One and that's why I like
telling people

133
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:22,836
about 18 people that our generation was the
first generation that made gaming mainstream
Gen X

134
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:29,629
it's true it's true Gen X Gen X was the
first generation that made it mainstream to
game

135
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:39,139
and yeah we're a tiny little generation that
doesn't have a lot to to to say uno

136
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:43,220
but the one thing we can say is we eat we
gave the world gaming

137
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:56,117
and we didn't we didn't solve The World's
problems with war or other stuff like that
but

138
00:20:56,573 --> 00:21:07,336
we thought everybody had a wasted afternoon
after school I'm sucking right now

139
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:14,183

it that was a great example out of shit

141
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,987
I guess I followed her

142
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:34,024
getting Computing yeah with the seventies
right the Boomers gave us the cave is
Computing really

143
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:35,778
yeah

144
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:46,121
I I I I hate to say it but they did give us
a lot about some things actually one of
things I get home I God has some good stuff
right there

145
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:52,457
and one of the things that gave us was
definitely

146
00:21:52,457 --> 00:22:02,976
definitely Computing computer to the
mainstream I guess that you could say they
give us a pcats we get we give the PC

147
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:26,955
it all right yeah we took that we took that
back I mean the Boomers left us with you
know this like you had to IBM people with
their sake no garters and their hymns and
you had you know how do eunuchs hippies and
the bell labs and it was still wasn't for
the bracket for the common person in the 80s
game is PCS no no doubt so

148
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:32,576

is that's why I should get her but I feel
like I'm missing something

151
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:53,973
I don't know though a baby not maybe that's
just my imagination

152
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:57,360
it

153
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:09,220
I seriously I remember like playing with my
my 8-bit games and they can someday when you
be cool to like have a movie that you can
run around in and play

154
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:15,193
that's what this is what it is this is like
a playable movie

know it's going to be

161
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:12,130
the money that comes from games the gaming
industry is like 10 to 20 times more than
the money for a holic good Hollywood movie
including like all the Marvel shit

162
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:20,441
because there's so much money in it and I

281
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:30,826

to generation those in the veins of the
infamous air flows

00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:15,468
partially Mastery inevitably leads to sudden
outbursts of power that take the form of
objective on control on this extremely
dangerous explosions that blow up obelisks
