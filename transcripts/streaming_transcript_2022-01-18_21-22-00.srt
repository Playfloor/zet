1
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,041
can you do the music thing again

2
00:01:07,465 --> 00:02:07,767
headed to meet again I keep doing that I
think I didn't do anything again so I'll
just say all that over again I do make sure
I look at the captions now and make sure
that there's like words on the teleprompter
so it happens it happens I'm just saying how
thankful I am for Leon he's talking about
Progressive web design right now and the
importance of making stuff that everybody
can use on the weather I really appreciate
what he's doing over there he's a great
teacher right man to wear as a different
style and paste and all that that's plenty
fine you know God knows I have my own style
and pace which isn't for everybody some
people think I'm a fucking asshole I think
I'm a condescending prick and then I'm
unhinged and they use all those words about
me and they continue to use those words
about me I recently it's been coming or
attack again I don't want to talk about it I
just want to say that I am really super
happy and pleased with my community and the
people that I've been able to help and those
people and how they have gone into the world
and helped others as well and

3
00:02:07,778 --> 00:03:01,244
and for the many people who have reserved
judgment and despite what some random person
is decided to to do 22 to go against me I
don't want to talk about it it's just the
one of the things anytime somebody attacks
me like that really does is it it really
helps me to Center and to get busy I don't
get mad get busy and that's what I've been
saying and so if you want to do that the
Busy that we can be doing right now is going
to be making kubernetes work from scratch we
are going to install kubernetes from scratch
we finally have the means and and the motive
to commit this crime and we are going to do
it we're going to do it God damn it is so so
here's here's how we're going to do it

4
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:59,652
we actually if you want to follow along let
me go ahead and make her get repo for this
so you guys can just follow the commits to
go to make it in there, or they robbed and
you just follow me on GitHub any commits
that I make whether it be to my total cast
of notes or even these transcriptions to CC
transcriptions from the the stream or a from
these learning Labs as soon as I abandoned
them cuz I learned enough to know I don't
want to go down that route and I'll put a
warning in there but it would be if you
actually want to recreate the the learning
that I've been doing sort of kind of in your
own way as a programmer whatever you can do
that I can go there and try that so so get
in it and then they getting it is kind of
crazy and you get Republic radio. Kid file
and then when it is a GH command which is a
repo create

5
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:08,002
I'm going to use a little bit of Bosch magic
here I'm going to be dashed description
sorry kiddo get a repo

6
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:41,984
create a description actually yeah and then
in here I'm going to put a little subshell
and I'm going to grab the first line off of
the readme file and pipe that through said
I'm going to translate the first the this
does the liver the hashtag for the title and
marked down and we get rid of it and we can
use that as our description and we can do
that that way and then I'll give us the name
of the repository and it public

7
00:04:40,418 --> 00:05:21,642
public annual income for the description
this time and go ahead but yes and if you're
serious here's a contact to read me this
became the description so we're just we're
just making a bass line thing we need to
commit to read me this will add it hasn't
been out yet so I had read me commit that's
a good, get out of my way I just have to get
part off Cinema stay and read me 9 D file
for the commit message and then we can get
push Dash you origin Maine it because it's
the first flush

8
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:50,096
that's just the standard way to do it and
that will get us our thing we can open that
up in a web browser and today we have a repo
that you can go to an end using so here it
is the giver is that this is the URL if you
want to go follow along you can like this
one if this is the thing kind of thing you
want to do and I don't know why my my status
hasn't updated on there

9
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:57,748
it makes me all that mad at me do Killarney
I still says I'm doing Witcher which was
really fun but I'm not doing any more

10
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:01,271
so let's see if that if they ate it

11
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,766
a bunch of little stuff have to update here
we have any listeners in Discord if I did

12
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:18,355
I probably I probably went to exit the stage
and just court and restart so the people
have the latest information

13
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,638
and then we're going to go ahead and start a
new stage in Discord if you just want to
listen too long

14
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:31,338
start with the stage put the topic

15
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:44,963
start stage I don't know if I'm able to get
the whole thing done today or not but I this
is something I've been wanting to serve a
long time and it makes me happy that we can
actually do know that we have vagrant
working so let's do that

16
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:47,704
let's do

17
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:56,407
so I guess we can keep this in here

18
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:04,881
are you all right

19
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:25,057
so first things first we are going to make a
vagrant file right after that we're not
going to do this to doctor we're going to
actually make the M's and all of the week
we've installed virtue the scripture that
read me in to stop what we're going to do so
step one

20
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,468
install a vagrant install

21
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:36,227
live Birds spell chemo

22
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:45,256
I never should have like prereqs on my cell
phone and couldn't hear the guests in
Discord when

23
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:50,995
no I know I'm sorry no you can't they've
been they've been banned

24
00:07:50,995 --> 00:08:20,748
yeah that's because I haven't got Discord
pipe properly yet I've only been doing
Discord video for a long time for the sound
any sound from my desktop gets pissed cut
out and putting music so I've been trying to
fix that a portion and I need to fix that I
need to fix that I don't know how to do we
probably will need to bring Discord in as a
separate audio channel so that it's you know
it's it's it's being

25
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,735
be ready I don't know how to do it though
because

26
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:54,583
we would have to allow it either that or we
have to if we have anything like that in
front of to turn music off. Turn the music
off completely when we do that every turn
the music off then I can actually turn the
channel back on and that's how they do the
desktop stuff and then we can just go for
it. That's probably the way to go about
doing it I'll remember that next time if I
don't if I forget so but yeah I know that
nothing on YouTube ever ever has that
happened so let's talk emu

27
00:08:54,588 --> 00:09:03,854
it's okay my liver hurts okay so I was wrong
we have some prereqs here here

28
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:11,301
but first i'm at that

29
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:21,130
he said the date for D & S picture you have
chemo KVM live

30
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:27,673
live Birds preferred live sh

31
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:32,455
I installed those are all kind of the same
thing

32
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:39,533
verse version song

33
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:54,050
Get set up a true Linux

34
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,685
our station

35
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:03,404
on bare metal

36
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,390
install vagrants

37
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:20,836
and configure or chemo for a Levert

38
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:30,190
All right and they'll probably put them in
order

39
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:36,073
so it's actually it's libert

40
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,420
and then liver cause chemo and chemo cause
KVM

41
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:57,239
yeah so I'm probably that there and I did
that already

42
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:00,882
Cardenas times out are scary

43
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:07,151
asymmetry Lennox workstation Babymetal
something I can figure for lovebirds

44
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,729
alright so

45
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:21,411
I don't really want to put this as
requirements or his steps

46
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,636
she can do the following

47
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:50,796
and I need to get a better format for this
and if so I need to talk to argue about this
I don't know if he's around right now sees a
different time frame

48
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:58,487
rme installed oh gosh

49
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:07,082
and alright so

50
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:14,027
different requirements or tasks August tasks

51
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,177
yes I'm kind of standardizing this little
bit

52
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:39,676
when you think you should call tasks or
should we call it I don't want to call
prerequisites right but they kind of are

53
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:46,961
here's the test I tell you how are you will
you find out

54
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:58,692
initialize a vagrant

55
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:01,381
projects

56
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:11,897
I'm going to try I will try to send you new
here and write out the stuff they plan

57
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:18,021
160 Thank you

58
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:20,961
and certified Unix

59
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:31,188
Alex Monterey is a certified Unix Seuss and
his largest set of used to play me some
World strict eunuchs right b a c units mean

60
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:36,741
is Monterey yeah

61
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:45,687
celebrity point of view Knicks in the world
right stripped Unix wow that's kind of cool

62
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:54,934
I mean you got it you got to give it to him
you know they still be a Siri but this tea
is still Unix right so yeah

63
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,674
initialize vagrant projects Etsy

64
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,779
and see how many things that we want

65
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,795
with

66
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:26,127
I ugly exchange or say 420 gpl3 that that I
knew because that's how come there bash was
so old

67
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:28,082
yep

68
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:37,751
it's all gpl2 yep I know I noticed that
because bash was like really really old and
then they came out Jose shell thing right

69
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:42,569
that so yeah that's what they're trying to
do they're trying to say hundred percent you
feel too

70
00:14:45,319 --> 00:15:11,011
which is their home and I wish they would
just say that instead of saying Z shows
better than Bosch you know I just instead of
instead of you know trying to lie anyway
since you're here so we're doing we're doing
I am going to try to do an H A Thing

71
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:16,577
yes it does is somebody fault yet as of like
a year or two ago

72
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:27,200
so question what do you think the minimum

73
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:35,186
in vagrant in a minimum number of machines
to get a good sense of using Cube ATM I'm
thinking 3 for a beginner

74
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:47,686
I'm thinking truth be told you really only a
baby just like you can have a single love
you the control plane and then you can have
yeah it's a single control plane and two
workers right

75
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:55,288
and and that's all it's all I really need
Vigor project with

76
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:59,962
with three Central us

77
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:17,390
you know what what what do you think of it,
so it was so it was so drunk he was telling
us that he's a big Alma fan and then it's
141 exactly compatible with extreme extreme
extreme and I know you talked about using
sent to us I've been thinking about

78
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:24,003
I think 3 Enterprise

79
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:33,482
enter price Unix actually Linux virtual
machines

80
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,274
or three Enterprise Linux virtual machines

81
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:49,227
I'm going to fight Enterprise going to put
preferably

82
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:57,349
red hat a variance

83
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:15,894
okay so with free enterprise Fairfield in
there as soon as I reach my machines

84
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:21,747
with and I think I think we should probably
have

85
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:35,888
four course each for the one we don't really
need that we could probably have two chords
for control for exit to course each should
be fine for this to course each should be
fine for setting it up right

86
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,193
each with

87
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:46,873
to Coors and to give what GB Ram

88
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,027
2 GB Ram

89
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,906
22 course 2GB Ram

90
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:02,854
I think that's probably the minimum they
probably want more than that right

91
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:07,136
2 GB Ram

92
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:18,119
that's a lot that's a 24-6 that's like 6 GB
RAM and let's say 20 GB of storage actually
10-gig probably is all you need

93
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:30,502
I mean if you were if you were doing this in
the cloud that would cost you a pretty penny
that would be if it is Angelo Shannon that
would be

94
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:35,854
Barbie like 30 bucks a month

95
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:41,031
how do you say thirty bucks a month to run
out if you're doing it in the Indian Ocean
so so yeah

96
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,847
so let's do that or say

97
00:18:54,482 --> 00:19:03,479
all right that's the first thing then what
then we're going to I'm pretty sure we're
going to make good creative control plane

98
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,537
so

99
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:15,231
we need to add some of the prerequisites
onto these systems so I think we need to
install a container we need to install

100
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:20,746
install a container runtime on

101
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:33,003
initialize a vagrant create a scene

102
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:47,918
create create three Enterprise Linux crate
crate 3

103
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:56,447
virtual machines for nodes

104
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:03,370
43 virtual maze machines

105
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:13,498
ants with two chords anybody storage

106
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:22,183
and what else do software and

107
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:29,959
present provision for vision with

108
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:41,052
Chris Smith each with a a doctor

109
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:45,619
no container engine

110
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:52,968
and we don't really need at this age but
Baker openssh on automatically soon

111
00:20:53,864 --> 00:21:01,451
that's really it everything else was with a
container and minimally

112
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:10,983
and any other administrative towards you
wish

113
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:21,801
so that's a step was just to get that done
and then we're going to go to the next step
which is going to be putting cute video on
where the control play nodes

114
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:25,431
Rocky Ford or Oregon use Center West

115
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:29,845
where is Alma this time so

116
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:38,101
alright so let's go do it

117
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,665
set up a true Lennox workstation of your
mental all right so

118
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:55,666
let's do that we need to do vagrants and it

119
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,984
now I could have done that actually let me
let me do a better one

120
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:15,418
you can do a bigger than did file and I want
to get good with acorn in it so I need to
understand bigger

121
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:24,185
fragrance and yet you can actually
initialize the system the way you want it

122
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:31,168
so I'm going to go read about this real
quick so maker in it

123
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:35,868
all right I'm going to be about this so they
weren't in it says

124
00:22:37,425 --> 00:23:03,685
I didn't name you are out you can give the
URL of the thing you wanted you want to do
this is your son is the current directory to
be very environment by Craig and just make
her file and when does not exist as giving
it will it will reap I figured they could
take a VM. Box sitting in the creative major
philant the second arguments given it will
pre-populate the config. DM box URL sending
it to create to the created vagrant file

125
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:11,071
stay in there for like a second is a box URL

126
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,836
are we having sex

127
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:27,086
if I fight the boxer up what's the
difference between box inbox URL

128
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:37,563
I don't know I am dime to noob minimalism
for the minimum thing probably created

129
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:44,691
having problems not contain a structural,
that's what I want for us over at output
file template

130
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:55,065
read Across America template Enterprise Ruby
I don't know that's the RV is that is a
template stuff for Ruby

131
00:23:55,604 --> 00:24:01,780
generic is it generic how can you how can
you look up the the ones

132
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:08,355
there's something else you can like I think
there's like a search right

133
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:11,993
connect cloud

134
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:22,743
cloud provider public search yes Cloud
search for Elma

135
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:31,738
Mega Cloud search for searching doesn't look
like it's going to find it

136
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:34,652
but we shall see

137
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:46,378
I think we can take a long time I wish I
could

138
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:53,459
Elmo Lenox 8 Alex.

139
00:24:55,631 --> 00:25:21,515

buy it from

140
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:27,962

144
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:29,951
I can't believe he raided him alright fine

145
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:32,647
Leon re2 Prime aging

146
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:41,269
you know what I don't give a shit anymore
the people that want to be here will be here
the people that don't

147
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:50,152
it's just so bad because the guy I can't
talk about it I'm going to stay positive
don't get mad get busy

148
00:26:53,631 --> 00:27:00,386
I I just I can't I can't talk about it I
can't talk about it it's going to get me mad

149
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:05,668
I can't talk about it

150
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,976
you know what if I

151
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:17,414
I can't talk about I can't talk about it
because I can't talk about it rationally

152
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:26,499
yes where do they sell School yeah I don't
know I don't know

153
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,852
it's not you just start

154
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:40,297
I can't talk about it I can't talk about
because I'll use it as footage you don't
throw me under the bus again like they
always do

155
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:51,557
I can talk about it I had called and I get
called in ancient angry curmudgeon and all
this other shit and and they go against me
meanwhile they're trying to let him Jubilee
help people

156
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:58,308
whatever I don't care I actually kind of is

157
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,106
he's going to go tell himhe's going to go
tell him about all it look okay

158
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:14,609
let me tell you I love you if you Fortune
people are here or wondering why I'm going
to say anything at all I'm going to tell you

159
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:29,555
the reason that I'm upset is because they're
about to throw under the bus go and say that
you should use wetrust for everything and it
completely defeat everybody

160
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:34,449
plants to be able to learn go to be able to
be productive in other things

161
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:49,807
and an 8-day throw me to the bus right there
with it the problem is is that he's too so
many of these people are so loud that they
get so many people to follow him and then
they just run all these people right off the
edge of the Cliff Richards cliff

162
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:52,671
they do it right about the edge of the cliff

163
00:28:53,311 --> 00:29:25,244
and and I just feel really bad I feel really
bad that I have to take stock and then the
people that I have helped have landed
200,000-plus jobs 100 to 200,000 plus jobs
and they are doing really significant things
are well beyond what these people are even
talking about and buy even saying that I get
called an asshole but even saying that I'm
trying to prepare people for more
significant employment they think that I'm
putting them all down and I think that I'm a
big ass hole and then and I didn't pedantic
and condescending I know that but still have
to walk away

164
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:06,880
well if you're if you feel like I do and you
can go you don't have to learn to Max and I
are see him and find out right now okay if
you want to learn it you can learn it

165
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,518
if you

166
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:24,608
you know there whatever you want I'm telling
you I'm done catering to people people
people that want to learn the stuff that I
do and the stuff that we do will come here
and they'll be fine

167
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:35,372
tell me the process but I don't know cuz I
just read a comment from somebody that was
like slamming me saying they wasted time for
3 months working on the beginner do stuff
with my stuff

168
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:43,567
and that makes me feel really shity actually
am I oh well at least you learned that's not
what you want to do in life

169
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,337
so just be warned

170
00:33:49,898 --> 00:34:02,208
all right and I'm this close to just fucking
stopping a whole streaming thing completely
and putting my nose to the grindstone and
changing the world and working with private
people completely

171
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:10,947
I know I don't have to give up on all the
cool people but then I would just always
stay close to them on Discord and I won't
have to put up with this shit

172
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,656
but whatever

173
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:27,929

at me she's saying to come down and I don't
leave she's like yeah I know, I'm saying

she's right there you're not consumers

175
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:48,872
you're not just consumers all of you with
people I care about but that's not what
people say people are characterizing me as
somebody who hates on everybody who comes to
the kids should be there in like a tax
entire we're going to entire swaths of
humanity and I kind of do

176
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:58,917
yeah well there are a lot of people who have
been shown the records I have to focus on
them as usual you have to focus on them

177
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:04,765
meanwhile other people lie

178
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:20,199
don't get mad and get busy don't get mad get
busy get shut your mouth and get busier on

alright where are we

188
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,530
but you are a condescending asshole

189
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:45,598
here's something else to being a centek to
being who you are and owning that and
warning others to stay out of the way if
they don't like who you are you know just be
who you are and if you are as a kind of
thing asshole you know you can work on that
shit and stuff but if it just turns out to
be who you are then just own it and move on
maybe you were born a villain in this life
and you just need to own warning warning

190
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:59,950
will put you down just whatever my stepson
is going to shirt that says you know
sarcastic comment loading and it's kind of
the thing and I'll have to be friends here

turbo charged

195
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:30,159

there's not a big enough it depends on the
place where yet

196
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:35,268
but driving drive me to such a pendulum is
going to be hard on you isn't it

00:55:56,244 --> 00:56:01,433
I mean we can look all over the place for

how do you call it for like if I want more
than one

336
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:49,944
so I guess I'm running right into the like
project-based kind of learning so

337
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:19,385

340
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:48,152
there you go I figured you could fix me a
magic word to him. Box provider versus box

341
00:58:48,288 --> 00:58:56,248
wait what a Shakur a 7 p.m. to box

00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:04,804
are they didn't figure being

344
00:59:05,282 --> 00:59:15,397
I got to see this one is this not showing
proper way you can fake a fake a VM Define

345
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:22,987
haschak or oh you got more than one VM

00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:51,833
yeah I just have been way better I don't
know how much you like the way I don't like
this whole by provider shit we definitely
want that so can you give me a minute to
find

350
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:56,667
config him. Define

351
00:59:56,824 --> 01:00:01,390
I'm going to say it's real plane

352
01:00:03,342 --> 01:00:10,193
who playing I ever see if search engine area

353
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:18,027
do buck and Sergeant time

354
01:00:19,797 --> 01:00:27,366
end see that box a while we can do some

355
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:33,576
box away we can do some hair I think 222 in
a box

356
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:40,688
if and then boxer fighter nice

357
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:46,693
it's a very box ACP

358
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:57,287
I know it's a master at our main is there
may know it's how's it going Harlem Prime
how are you

359
01:00:57,622 --> 01:01:01,781
Isuzu main for this and a box

360
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:09,567
end. End on a Friday that provider

361
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:16,735
I am okay I got it as soon as a tough day
but I'm getting over it

362
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:25,075
what's a great day until I read YouTube and
twitch no surprise there

363
01:01:26,735 --> 01:01:28,196
Levert

364
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:38,880
disc I like that I'm totally stealing it

365
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:42,496
I mean if it's around for stealing what are
they for

366
01:01:43,515 --> 01:01:49,480
an m-disc we're going to have her anyway so
I got 10 gigabytes

367
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:57,952
I mean yeah it should be fine primary true
memory

368
01:02:01,744 --> 01:02:06,972
MDOC memory m. Cpu2

369
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:11,483
and provision that she'll thing

370
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:18,358
yeah we need darker on all of these you know
it says that it's like it's

371
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,413
it says that it kind of adopts the other
ones

372
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:34,081
this is so I'm happy I hope the rest of your
day is better nice glad you got in when the
Supreme of course you got into something at
school

373
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:46,268
on a couple thousand we have it we were
studying the same amount I would do 2000

374
01:02:52,324 --> 01:02:56,044
so so what I think

375
01:02:57,634 --> 01:03:06,656
I think there's a way to Ness vagrant files
so that everything uses your comments thing
and then you add more stuff to it and I mean

376
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:13,410
I was offering to hear what a great job I
mean a great class

377
01:03:13,674 --> 01:03:23,198
was it always just suffering that was
Computer Engineering or Miss read it or
whatever kind of fun to hear

378
01:03:25,618 --> 01:04:03,086
when it when it hears there's a question I
have for bigger in this this this evening is
me exploring vagrant so if you're not into
that you know that's that's what we're doing
I think it's an old Tech you know and it
used to be but I want to be able to do I
want to be able to take the beginning of an
image and say I want all this other stuff to
get the same as that image but I want it to
subclass that and add more stuff and I mean
and I'm almost positive you can do that I
just I've never done it don't know how to do
so I text you to your hard drives

379
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,882
I just extra storage

380
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:12,285
and I scored uh box bionic by the mostly

381
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:20,730
yeah sure funny I hate you know what you're
going to have to learn like a dozen
languages or so if you want to be a good in
Tech eventually so

382
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:29,210
I'll look at that look at that I'm going to
have to learn Ruby shit I'm going to have to
actually learn Ruby again

383
01:04:29,249 --> 01:04:35,749
093 each Duets like ancient what kind of a
cab driver in that movie in years

384
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:41,704
just cuz I dig this gives you 3 discs

385
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:51,636
it makes me think I need to do this for
nodes I could kind of do that

386
01:04:53,096 --> 01:04:59,525
I could kind of make three nodes attaching a
few drives God damn

387
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:05,522
goddamn have I feel so bad she suggests you

388
01:05:07,474 --> 01:05:13,168
I got it sold it already I can't believe I'm
getting as much as a ruby

389
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:21,795
there's been really upgrading a credit from
Source insulation come man does

390
01:05:22,111 --> 01:05:30,696
it's good that they can share no I can file
yes please big on file

391
01:05:31,497 --> 01:05:38,660
it's been an awesome yeah Ruby is pretty
much the best configuration language ever I
mean it really is fantastic for it

392
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:45,804
refrigerator house describe the type of
machine blah blah blah blah blah

393
01:05:46,546 --> 01:06:00,227
Cynthia Rose by another requirement is not
necessary to make modifications that group
is not even the most Popular Community Bank
or is using which should help show that you
aren't that despite I haven't really known
as people are very successful with Veyron

394
01:06:00,229 --> 01:06:11,657
here's a low cross every platform supports
look at that when we talked about that on
this in in larger font in files Etc

395
01:06:12,224 --> 01:06:16,904
reminder specific overrides yeah

396
01:06:17,571 --> 01:06:22,332
what I want to know is how to group stuff

397
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:27,305
being the bigger versions of the tricks I'm
sure it's here

398
01:06:28,815 --> 01:06:32,407
replace closest Ruby Loop over the ends

399
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:39,548
that's this one talking about this is what
I'm talking about right there that's exactly
what I was looking for him

400
01:06:39,548 --> 01:06:42,062
I appreciate that they did that

401
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:52,458
never better she'll inline hello kit for No
21 yes please we want three nodes each do I
so cool

402
01:06:52,459 --> 01:06:57,746
0 to 3 1 2 3

403
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:05,393
1 2 3 we will have. It's due

404
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:11,756
I and and then and then

405
01:07:11,756 --> 01:07:16,517
is a VM Define goddamn is it cool

406
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:23,790
config. I am. Define

407
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,006
what is the template

408
01:07:26,065 --> 01:07:32,301
yeah he's always have those God damn I
haven't been receptive and forever

409
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:36,962
no I can't even type

410
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:45,994
so there we have no. I do node

411
01:07:46,394 --> 01:07:51,704
in node

412
01:07:56,686 --> 01:08:02,765
see how we do that and we can pop up free
knows all once so wheat

413
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:10,675
so we each to try it I'm actually done into
dry this pretty gel

414
01:08:10,675 --> 01:08:16,167
yes Echo

415
01:08:17,157 --> 01:08:23,831
node I want us to actually replace

416
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:34,256
I I don't know we're driving we can try
vagrants up

417
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:44,739
failed the sitting service is reproducible
convenience expected in and of course you
did what was I thinking

418
01:08:48,343 --> 01:08:51,190
Sonny's to go over

419
01:08:54,785 --> 01:09:00,613
indeed thank you some people still like me
apparently

420
01:09:00,738 --> 01:09:16,332
this is Ruby of all things you think you'd
see that here it is actually still one of
the big languages for security to because
it's all written and Ruby originally it was
raining really I think I opened it up now

421
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:25,010
moral of the story is you have to know more
than one language to be good in Tech

422
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,811
what a surprise right

423
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:38,495
oh my God bring up machine on with with
liver provider and Erica are all be shown
all tasks completed

424
01:09:38,496 --> 01:09:44,374
compare an interactive Ice King there's
bigger unknown configuration see if you
section equals

425
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:52,071
I feel I feel not very smart

426
01:09:52,831 --> 01:09:59,591
cuz you don't need it I need to equal sign
here cuz it's not yamral goddamnit or like
whatever

427
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:08,604
big enough it can't possibly be done
remember coronavirus given to

428
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:17,679
why the hell find vagrant lines 7 7

429
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:24,558
well I don't know but what

430
01:10:25,802 --> 01:10:30,498
is it a, Nubian provision shell

431
01:10:32,023 --> 01:10:36,994
inline blah shell

432
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:44,036
show in line tell him what's up there

433
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:52,313
do not do not know what is up with that if
you think they could I do

434
01:10:53,588 --> 01:11:01,161
all right let's look in one session ha Luna
Bakery configuration

435
01:11:03,214 --> 01:11:08,060
sorry we're I so find this very fun

436
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:15,759
middle settings in address string I want
examples I don't do Wellness examples

437
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:25,753
it's a lot to see yeah she's pretty good too
obviously foxes provisioning

438
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:32,356
basic overview are you

439
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,912
make a provision

440
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:42,806
all right so it's different

441
01:11:46,004 --> 01:11:52,613
overview networking automation I need to
find a more examples

442
01:11:54,304 --> 01:12:01,433
when I got some Ranger I have a I haven't
had an error at what is

443
01:12:02,603 --> 01:12:06,039
I do not know I know not

444
01:12:09,529 --> 01:12:13,786
we're not going to argue is given to a line
7

445
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:25,048
is your Alma I think

446
01:12:26,368 --> 01:12:28,123
is that right

447
01:12:32,393 --> 01:12:39,834
I don't know montego's extra weight equal
signs

448
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:48,047
so I have it wrong I haven't wrong

449
01:12:48,213 --> 01:12:54,189
I know I did that way disguise

450

I ain't do nothing wrong oh boy I don't
figuration section

451
01:13:02,974 --> 01:13:10,550
damn it I don't know Ruby and it is spin
forever

452
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:22,765
they can fall or you I don't I don't I have
to hurry to get this in texts

453
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:29,624
configure be in Genesis how you doing
Grandpa Jones

454
01:13:30,799 --> 01:13:38,108
do you know where the shell and 9 block

455
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:48,790
all right I'll leave you alone you just goes
cuz if you change the value it's not work

456
01:13:49,073 --> 01:13:55,241
or I guess I should actually my face value
most host local

I wish what's the name of this song rain
cloud

460
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:25,267
it I don't see what's up there I don't know
unless it doesn't know what it is

461
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:34,524
if you have a box something is not right of
Italy bigger file

462
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:42,298
no no no note that if you end up box

463
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:47,688
or is that config.ini in the Box I want to
know

464
01:14:48,146 --> 01:14:53,592
it is to think of your mailbox it is it's
not node

465
01:14:56,863 --> 01:15:03,825
Shelby Rodriguez yes I think that's

466

468
01:15:21,593 --> 01:15:23,979
steering box is in the Box ad

469
01:15:25,615 --> 01:15:30,309
can I grab a config. I don't think it's
supposed to be node

470
01:15:32,224 --> 01:15:38,726
I guess was to be no. Listening

471
01:15:40,146 --> 01:15:45,449
so I guess it's the obvious obviously Citrix

472
01:15:46,694 --> 01:15:52,378
and it being that person why is it not happy
about

473
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:57,971
not memory I see if you

474
01:16:00,925 --> 01:16:07,312
I made it farther this time an error
occurred of a shown after

475
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:11,787
I said he shouldn't exist if your memory

476
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:23,431
there are secretions between the fox say you
shouldn't exist or I find all right fine I
got your point so see this is to

477
01:16:25,898 --> 01:16:32,085
but why is it take me to Center in Ellicott
City.

478
01:16:33,304 --> 01:16:39,488
Alright so we're so it's fine to see if you
section yeah was that VM

479
01:16:40,657 --> 01:16:43,937

01:17:00,896 --> 01:17:03,791
I said I should have huh

483
01:17:04,682 --> 01:17:34,953
I guess I got to do no 21 what is a use for
I mean vagrant for fun at mostly mostly for
boot camps who helped you do an old-school
bootcamps to do Ruby on Rails that's its
most common usage second-greatest usages in
security and medical database and vagrant is
so that you'll find old stuff that's been
done in it make sure it's very old hag been
around for a long time

484
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:40,778
so provider provision is range

485
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:46,886
and yes disc them box version

486
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:57,301
box that has a makeup box I think we do I
think we have to make a box that has a
vehicle that has the storage unit and then
associate the box with the storage

487
01:17:57,303 --> 01:18:03,823
that's what I think has to happen yeah cuz I
don't see anything about

488
01:18:04,745 --> 01:18:10,667
I don't see anything about Mary

489
01:18:11,756 --> 01:18:15,673
adequate

490
01:18:20,151 --> 01:18:22,286

what the hell

496
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:04,677
I was going to make a box that can be
published that's all we want, we want we
want to actually put it in original box

497
01:19:04,678 --> 01:19:09,425
things taking way too long is it going to it
is taking way too long

498
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:19,760
I think I'm ignorant plugins host

499
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,107
at some point VM

500
01:19:25,013 --> 01:19:31,624
if you have allowed them all Associates Mac
address boot being boxes

501
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:36,654
that should be the name of the cell blocks
that's your head name

Network puts up provider Anarchy slivered

505
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:19,938
where is the First music variation which has
used his return provider it's a live web
framework Sam Visions on the machine bubble
gun

506
01:20:20,552 --> 01:20:26,628
I do understand there is literally no where
is it say anything about CPU in any of the
bigger dogs

507
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:33,518
and that's the whole fucking point I think
it is

508
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:44,187
Central exact am I wrong

509
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:52,417
I mean how well I know how to fix this cuz I
already did it

510
01:20:54,575 --> 01:20:58,335
it was my provider though and that's the
thing I'm confused about

511
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,158
sing a setup

512
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:12,655
zbrush a specific provider specific

513
01:21:17,117 --> 01:21:19,118
that doesn't make any sense

514
01:21:21,269 --> 01:21:34,252
if their provider specific then okay I think
I know what we have to do then we have to
inline them if we're going to do it like
this yeah that would that's not immediately
obvious so that means

515
01:21:34,254 --> 01:21:40,840
if they are providing specific so we do live
like this right and

516
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:49,171
Amityville, and probably do memory

517
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:56,348
I have no idea if you have any memory equals
2048 or colon

518
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:06,250
, CPU colon

519
01:22:06,626 --> 01:22:11,641
2 I bet you that's it

520
01:22:13,348 --> 01:22:17,922
what you think oh you found something

521
01:22:22,681 --> 01:22:30,366
thanks for that thank you for that having
fun

522
01:22:32,104 --> 01:22:34,644
and increase memory

523
01:22:38,258 --> 01:22:49,402
yeah this is just for this for time to find
the rim size if you can like this but that
that means you might have to change it every
time I want what if I want to have a
different size for each one

524
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:55,245
I mean I mean I see that that's a thing that
you can do

525
01:22:55,404 --> 01:23:02,931
I said was a okay so it's a property of
provider right

526
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:06,944
make bubble gum

527
01:23:06,944 --> 01:23:14,315
but then how can I have been whole point is
to have another virtual machine I don't have
to decide right

528
01:23:14,316 --> 01:23:17,132
I mean when they do that

529
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:26,695
I'm sad I mean it's like so go ahead last
Hunter Chris memory

530
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,473
being provided with a box to do blogging
arguing Nordstrom

531
01:23:39,617 --> 01:23:47,185
so so what I want to know is I mean it looks
like I'm doing something that's tricky

532
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:51,974
that's tricky so I'm kind of out of you know
around here

533
01:23:54,288 --> 01:24:01,837
it does not listen to make any sense because
why are CPU a factor of the provider are not
a factor of this Pacific p.m.

534
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:09,707
the main models broken MC and I'm saying and
it made him also the fucking broken it's
like

535
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:15,319
I mean I did that just doesn't make any
sense to me

536
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:25,880
I have a feeling that I'm doing it close to
the right way but I don't it's obviously not
that way

537
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:29,252
if I don't keep those memories of you

538
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:40,971
a maybe maybe even equal sign and it is it
that that doesn't who knows

539
01:24:41,553 --> 01:24:53,495
I mean I can do it by saying and giving the
provider of those parameters but I don't
have to change the parameters every time I
know it doesn't make any sense I know
everything is valid

540
01:24:53,799 --> 01:25:00,900
I don't I don't believe that's valid I don't
think you can write that I don't know

541
01:25:01,581 --> 01:25:04,238
I mean I can do

542
01:25:08,475 --> 01:25:32,545
okay so it's a different provider if I want
to have a different be I might have to
change the sizes for all the provider then
for the provider's dynamically as I'm going
along making GM doesn't make any sense it's
like a totally fucking broken the main model
I I see I see how to get it to work but I
don't want to do this because it's like

543
01:25:32,547 --> 01:25:34,259
I mean it's a hack

544
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:46,228
they they want us to do is probably I mean I
make it to work but I don't want to so many
memories we used to farm

545
01:25:46,781 --> 01:25:52,551
UPS in Agawam and that should do it

546
01:25:53,068 --> 01:25:56,478
and that is stupid

547
01:25:56,894 --> 01:26:05,412
it's always something I have a feeling death
disc is not associate with that that's going
to feel next I think disc is outside the
realm of um

548
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:13,537
Matthew 08 the professor didn't work

01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,061
all right fine

553
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:44,487
I have inline set so why is it I don't think
it likes to the center

554
01:26:45,647 --> 01:26:52,808
I don't want to see so, path, and we don't
have a bath

555
01:26:56,926 --> 01:27:01,613
do you need that we shall see

556
01:27:01,613 --> 01:27:05,104
I need the shell for Valiant provisioner

557
01:27:05,105 --> 01:27:10,029
how many things understand you though so I'm
actually kind of encouragement that

558
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:14,908
show overview of provisioning

559
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:27,141
Iverson Bakery has up it runs I first
figured I'm crazy about him pushing his run

The Shield provider in line that's why I
String Ashoka Madeline text you when I'm a
machine to Neon Lights from session path
string that's a shell script

563
01:27:50,981 --> 01:28:06,855
script to upload is our path like doing in
line a complicated shelter for bruising is
not good

564
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:11,705
I don't like that path of provision

565
01:28:20,697 --> 01:28:27,294
do you do this provision hey sissy

593
01:32:44,713 --> 01:32:49,598

we shall see

608
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:47,553

not found fuck you

609
01:34:51,713 --> 01:34:53,728
it does seem to be doing it though

610
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:05,799
wait a new app did there's no I have kids

611

I'm so sorry

613
01:35:29,101 --> 01:35:35,610
I can only laugh at myself on that one that
was that was very silly very silly

614
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:46,784
I forgot research pretty funny today see
this is the kind of thing you should watch

615
01:35:48,716 --> 01:36:07,528
base OS app stream extras let's get them all
got to get them all at the Pokemon thing

haven't watched a single episode as a true
my wife a half-hour episodes Once Upon a
Time my kids I don't remember it

616
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:14,723
how to say try yum

617
01:36:14,845 --> 01:36:26,715
I didn't answer so I can see that was a wild
guess okay that's what it's called that's
what doctor is with our communication is
called in a while and apparently it's not
present elsewhere

618
01:36:27,188 --> 01:36:30,908
so yeah you think I'm going to do

619
01:36:34,787 --> 01:36:38,628
did the did the did the

620
01:36:40,188 --> 01:36:44,891
tutu tutu tutu tutu tutu tutu

621
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:57,572
it seems like it's busy though

622
01:37:00,524 --> 01:37:09,931
it is taking longer than I would have liked
course at the end of the day it has to do a
lot. Can I can I do it so that it doesn't
occur in Lee

623
01:37:10,436 --> 01:37:18,417
I wonder if it's like concurrency thing and
I mean God damn it didn't replace it

624
01:37:18,417 --> 01:37:23,482
it's a very sad I'm very sad nevertheless

625
01:37:24,768 --> 01:37:30,403
it's just another one this time no it does
not a time in minor name

626
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:33,947
I will not look at the Moon

627
01:37:35,923 --> 01:37:42,404
I sit the hostname why did you not work why
you no work config. V n

628
01:37:43,664 --> 01:37:51,616
host nameis it is it outside of the M scope

629
01:37:56,063 --> 01:38:02,894
I feel like it failed so we have a new host
name

630
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:12,519
why isn't even there it should not be there

631
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,075
that was a mistake

632
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:25,083
I didn't pick up the hostname That's that
wears me all that

633
01:38:43,919 --> 01:38:48,878
it makes me wonder if I need to do can you
get VM

634
01:38:52,269 --> 01:38:57,117
I know saying I don't know here to Duke

635
01:38:58,368 --> 01:39:04,997
give him a box of Krampus as soon as they
said after you crave games

636
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:15,647
I'll take a rest after cuz you with your
plan do this every person within a bunch of
itself okay so that's not that's not a thing
you do currently

637
01:39:15,755 --> 01:39:21,272
I think it is facts I guess that's not a
thing that you do

638
01:39:22,647 --> 01:39:29,451
is think bigger and says yes that that I
know so so I just didn't want to come on
thing

639
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:36,269
they all are all identical that's fine
that's no fun except that accept that

640
01:39:36,993 --> 01:39:43,481
installing docker addition until

01:41:52,721 --> 01:41:56,272
do they have potato do you please send me
the opportunity

659
01:41:58,181 --> 01:42:02,950
I am losing my interest in Elma as an
operating system

660
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:10,433
because if it doesn't have the standard
stuff I don't know if I want to fuck with it

661
01:42:10,857 --> 01:42:19,000
dr. Felton I'm just going to have to add a
few PA or something like that for doctor

662
01:42:19,788 --> 01:42:26,488
installing docker Ciana Center West

663
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,869
yeah

664
01:42:38,201 --> 01:42:44,010
you saved our supposed to be something there
because I like her just a very depending on
your needs

665
01:42:48,161 --> 01:42:54,294
Repository Emma tells config manager okay I
guess we need that

666
01:42:56,799 --> 01:43:02,637
Emma tails had already I think manager

667
01:43:03,882 --> 01:43:07,127
I have never used him so this is really good

668
01:43:07,364 --> 01:43:11,926
I mean I have used that I used it a ton but
then it was like 15 years ago

669
01:43:27,839 --> 01:43:34,604
all right Sam out of your right that looks
like a man that actually worked

670
01:43:35,053 --> 01:43:40,934
therefore we shall add it has been blessed

671
01:43:42,506 --> 01:43:45,977
bless you bless you

672
01:43:49,339 --> 01:43:56,588
getting medicine on her manager could take
berninger and a repo

673
01:43:58,544 --> 01:44:05,854
ABS darker Etc I'm using the mouse sue me

674
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:07,812
sue me

675
01:44:12,613 --> 01:44:20,529
all right so that should work I ate the
second utils are getting installed on
automatically so I don't think neither

676
01:44:21,077 --> 01:44:26,449
unable to proceed nightly nightly I think I
want that

677
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:40,099
why do we not nightly there's no point I
don't even ever thought about another
Channel

678
01:44:40,247 --> 01:44:47,891
yeah let's see if we can sell that if we can
actually saw it on the thing now on the
thingamabob

679
01:44:49,995 --> 01:44:57,992
any repo weather at work just

680
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:07,034
I don't think it worked I don't hook

681
01:45:07,725 --> 01:45:13,950
pseudo young that's why I install doctor C

682
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:19,920
okay only it's working alrighty

683
01:45:20,485 --> 01:45:23,183
that is all we need

684
01:45:25,808 --> 01:45:32,082
set my wife got back from our walk with the
dog show my for a lock that we've been fun

685
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:40,354
so you're giving manager

686
01:45:45,408 --> 01:45:50,728
and if a doctor now. Going to come then I
said I was starts with a c and repo

687
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:54,869
enable the nightly in Chester close

688
01:46:04,944 --> 01:46:12,235
Aaron is a sister best musically I don't
need it I don't need it

689
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:19,070
dr. clivio

690
01:46:23,106 --> 01:46:30,338
how did the doctor say last not a bad thing
so let's add that

691
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:33,911
it was on that

692
01:46:34,126 --> 01:46:41,623
slime

693
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:44,931
complete nothing to do

694
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:58,216
is already installed I forgot you're even
sold separately I remember doing that on
another project I didn't I was like hey
those are all redundant is his my
workstation container project

695
01:46:58,218 --> 01:47:06,064
don't need any of that hackers unites
hackers Unite

696
01:47:10,876 --> 01:47:17,753
we are the 1% that's the slogan from Amanda
don't over the where

697
01:47:20,989 --> 01:47:34,842
I this is it I think we're done I think I
think I finished the main first parts of it
now it's kind of like your Cube ATM and
stuff like that I think we're going to go so
yeah that's right I'm just read the whole
thing and I'm going to redo it

698
01:47:34,902 --> 01:47:40,664
so when do vagrants destroy

699
01:47:41,489 --> 01:47:44,473
I'm going to hold a rash to see if it works

700
01:47:44,487 --> 01:48:09,274
and it should the other day we should have
three provision nodes of identical situation
going on and then we can go ahead and do
Hugh ATM yet this the vagrant that way this
way I kind of the script it's the
configuration right for vagrant it it in the
provisioner runs it's the first thing that
runs on the newly provisioned machine
virtual machine

701
01:48:11,782 --> 01:48:17,829
and so yeah how's it going to be if your
brother can you see and

702
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:24,767
what that means is that the reason I did
this is because I want to bring up

703
01:48:25,016 --> 01:49:25,891
this is pretty personal I've never had a
friend like today is my birthday if so I'm
not okay with this but you know I want you I
want to be able to bring up a bunch of
virtual Machines of specific specs and
proficient specific provisioning really
quickly on my machine I don't want to have
to walk around the cloud or any of that
stuff I just want to have it on my machine
so I can go in and test different stuff and
that's what I'm using to so this is a loop
that lives through three times using crates
three, which is a CV according to chunky it
is the best of the best when it comes to it
has far fewer bugs than stream which is
another sentiment switches has been taken
over by by redhead it's also Alma is also
independent of red hat which I like
completely out of sight right accountability
so they didn't this wishes you design are
based on Enterprise Solutions said that you
you get you know what the Enterprise feel
and you have to do this if you want to

704
01:49:25,900 --> 01:50:25,966
we install kubernetes because communities
Wikipedia that's if you were paid by
contract firm like I am to go to a company
and insecurities and get it all set up this
is exactly what you would have to do you
write a script like this but you might
actually write a script like this it depends
on how many big writing may be due to her
former ansible which is why we stuff to
learn those things and then they would chop
out a bunch of gems for you and then you
would install it and keep it in and going
through the process has been so I can
register you can meet him it's something
I've never done it something I've never not
been to Salt been working for years and
committees admin and that's something I've
never done because I've been struggling with
how to get that to get to the point where
you can do that without buying Cloud space
on Amazon whatever and this this is by far
the most knowledgeable people that I've
watched on YouTube I mean really truly
knowledgeable people who was very very few
subscribers and Watchers because they're
just fucking awesome they're not marketing
people

705
01:50:26,564 --> 01:51:26,275
nail sucking on it yeah yeah terraform
ansible yeah they're all they're all a
little bit but at the end of the day you
have to provision machine Singer sewing
machines usually and you have to be able to
install using keep ATM on there and you need
to be able to go in and need to be able to
add another and the control playing those
are all things you can't do unless you have
a machine you can't practice S7 mini Cube
I'm sorry you can't you can't practice with
me to give you a sweet kind you can practice
with physical machines when it's a pain in
the ass because you have to reimage them
every time you want a new one so this kind
of stuff the best way to practice is either
in the cloud or using something like vagrant
to do the send I watch two different people
on YouTube to do this and they are almost
impossible to watch their their quality
videos of just about everything but the way
that they just used to a vagrant to just pop
up a whole bunch of stuff and show you how
to

706
01:51:26,283 --> 01:51:46,600
initialize kubernetes is very it's very
unassuming and it's very it's very advanced
in and it doesn't have a lot of handling and
it's just fucking amazing and so that's
that's where I learned about nature and then
I got kind of profit by its ravenous in lack
of support for the verdict which turned out
to be delivered from that vagrant and so
then we're back to a good spice Play Store
and I'm very very happy

707
01:51:46,687 --> 01:52:01,597
you know there's one solution when there's
actually one solution to being frustrated
and nervous and mad and feeling like you're
getting put down you know that answer is
getting busy making cool shit

708
01:52:01,896 --> 01:52:07,134
getting busy making potion

709
01:52:07,367 --> 01:52:21,131
Kreischer tongue we're fine with ph be all
day today with the doctor making cool shit
and BHP there you go not bad and moderate
HPI I took a moment to look at it with three
Jenny when she was here

710
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:26,180
solicitous let's do

711
01:52:32,272 --> 01:52:43,349
let's do something here let's do I don't
think we can you keep medium yet actually I
think I honestly I think we're done I think
we're actually done

712
01:52:43,865 --> 01:52:46,426
rigor SSH node one

713
01:52:53,799 --> 01:52:58,301
I've been craving for a nice man run
Megaforce I wish I could

714
01:52:59,596 --> 01:53:12,700
I was going to I was going to make a a
function in Ruby I need to know if I could
if I knew Ruby I can make a function that
into which I pass a variable and I mean

715
01:53:12,821 --> 01:53:18,037
and I can actually call it but I don't know
how to do that

716
01:53:18,931 --> 01:53:21,221
I try not to do function Ruby

717
01:53:21,986 --> 01:53:30,043
hey bro I protects the processing fee and
how are you doing I'm still processing

718
01:53:30,044 --> 01:53:37,905
is it really deaf do you think I could do it
if I didn't. You think I could call into it
and pass it in a variable and then and then
replace it

719
01:53:38,524 --> 01:53:42,705
reviews of Henry yes

720
01:53:43,338 --> 01:53:50,702
when it when I want is I don't want it to do
three of them I want to actually call the
function three times with different names

721
01:53:50,702 --> 01:54:00,838
what I think I can do I don't think I can do
because cuz this has to be in scope right
config has to be in the same scope can I can
I do in a closure

722
01:54:01,377 --> 01:54:06,202
can I have can I have to find a close around
here can I do this

723
01:54:11,434 --> 01:54:15,609
deaf make

724
01:54:17,493 --> 01:54:25,137
and then Jamie and then this could be

725
01:54:26,162 --> 01:54:32,157
is it be the name God damn

726
01:54:33,788 --> 01:54:40,234
how to pass an argument to it I do not know
SA

727
01:54:41,285 --> 01:54:44,128
it's kind of good I'm kind of Happy

728
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:49,318
I do I think I think it is called a closer I
think you can do it

729
01:54:49,319 --> 01:54:55,778
I'm almost positive you can't swim the great
things about Ruby best arguments

730
01:54:58,626 --> 01:55:04,862
can I just run inside of here I think I can
write on python you can

731
01:55:04,862 --> 01:55:11,929
so I just need to find out how to define

732
01:55:11,929 --> 01:55:17,361
I didn't do Ruby okay death High that's
literally it

733
01:55:17,598 --> 01:55:24,738
are you kidding me deaf name right

734
01:55:25,467 --> 01:55:30,140
and descend descend to go to the config
right

735
01:55:30,481 --> 01:55:37,631
so we could do then I could do make

736
01:55:37,894 --> 01:55:41,259
can you just pass it like this

737
01:55:43,573 --> 01:55:46,696
this isn't pythons Ruby

738
01:55:48,616 --> 01:55:54,732
how do I call it though

739
01:55:54,733 --> 01:56:00,526
Methodist method High. Predators

740
01:56:01,098 --> 01:56:07,771
fuck no Chiara Smith and a star from Earth

741
01:56:07,772 --> 01:56:14,454
I forgot about the association I forgot
about that method method no hear. Predators

742
01:56:14,455 --> 01:56:22,189
shut you can't

743
01:56:22,406 --> 01:56:25,415
I don't think you can

744
01:56:29,773 --> 01:56:36,101
we need to really like her close yours

745
01:56:37,969 --> 01:56:39,426
closures in Ruby

746
01:56:44,007 --> 01:56:48,871
all right so closers lock name

747
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:59,141
do you put inside him 2 item 47 if I really
miss us

748
01:57:00,464 --> 01:57:05,723
I don't know if it's once

749
01:57:07,115 --> 01:57:13,528
print once arrested for this fall back
Prescott yelled at fuck now I don't yield

750
01:57:18,761 --> 01:57:26,213
I can hate you if we have to use those
foreclosure fuck it I hate that that's like
one of the worst things ever

751
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:35,123
pregnancy Medical nope ha

752
01:57:35,488 --> 01:57:41,242
I mean we should be able to close right this
is an easy thing I just want to repeat this
three times

753
01:57:42,057 --> 01:57:46,822
so how do I do that

754
01:57:49,049 --> 01:57:56,342
could I could I pass three things so it
could find do you know I can't do that
because I have to Loop

755
01:57:57,655 --> 01:58:03,441
this is a function call to say I'm calling
them to find do

756
01:58:03,877 --> 01:58:08,843
this on it and pass it no no no never so

757
01:58:11,913 --> 01:58:23,757
how can I do that

758
01:58:26,272 --> 01:58:29,391
I mean I think I think it's possible I just
don't know

759
01:58:34,409 --> 01:58:39,503
it's okay if I'm not about you done in
Russia

760
01:58:40,708 --> 01:58:47,063
okay so let's do what do they say

761
01:58:48,443 --> 01:58:59,940
and if you write and Ruby I don't know how
to fix it if I could probably put it if it's
a problem with that is I lose all the embeds
going to mean

762
01:59:00,012 --> 01:59:06,817
so I would lose this I have to pass I don't
think this is a symbol that can be passed

763
01:59:07,344 --> 01:59:14,014
cell I don't I don't think it is I don't
think this is some of the can be passed

764
01:59:15,111 --> 01:59:21,823
so what I couldn't do is they couldn't going
to rain is not numbers

765
01:59:22,269 --> 01:59:26,772
yeah what's that control plane

766
01:59:31,706 --> 01:59:34,339
no one

767
01:59:39,845 --> 01:59:49,163
I supposed to call him to drop his anywhere
there's a new name for it what is the new
name for control planes in kubernetes

768
01:59:53,718 --> 01:59:58,526
controller manager stop playing

769
02:00:01,648 --> 02:00:09,405
control plane components I knew master and I
suppose, Master now because recent sweat

770
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:17,420
is Newnan I think I think it's just control
I think I have a move for that referral one

771
02:00:17,592 --> 02:00:23,360
node one I think was going to call in those
10 to I think this will work

772
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:28,068
it's cuz I want to have any games each

773
02:00:28,573 --> 02:00:31,567
how do we have a 4 and do

774
02:00:34,966 --> 02:00:40,852
name and then

775
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:52,924
to do vagrants up damn it they Grant a

776
02:00:53,554 --> 02:00:59,508
driving. I really not the case but that
needs to be in a r a

777
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:04,252
you make an array of strings and Ruby

778
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:09,379
RV

779
02:01:12,193 --> 02:01:17,410
oh my God I be I'm going to be in town I
totally forgot

780

02:02:53,312 --> 02:03:00,016
is there a reason rain yeah but I don't
think

793
02:03:01,096 --> 02:03:03,669
you know what actually I think it is that

794
02:03:06,249 --> 02:03:10,988
I think it's that's them because

795
02:03:25,466 --> 02:03:33,548
ignorance yeah I think I think because the
only one that knows this is his range I
think it was because it was arranged I think
this is because of the list

796
02:03:34,309 --> 02:03:40,433
yeah recurrence app

797
02:03:44,787 --> 02:03:47,257

798
02:03:52,132 --> 02:03:58,360
oh I had another end in Kelvin

799
02:04:01,217 --> 02:04:05,492

they synchronously is that too much for my
computer to handle

812
02:06:07,142 --> 02:06:12,672
I think it might be holy cow my provisioning
failed though

813

hate things are actually cuz they're bad and
sometimes I hate things are annoying and SE
Lennox is annoying in good so let me be
clear

819
02:06:58,764 --> 02:07:10,489
that is awesome I have my own career days
already and I just had to run a command and
you can run a command to just install
vagrant and you can run this command you can
up your own environment

820
02:07:10,711 --> 02:07:13,236
I wonder what my top is doing

821
02:07:13,933 --> 02:07:24,607
and like I'm not even like overly stressed
my systems not overly stressed to see if you
it's it's more stress than it usually is but
it's not like crazy crazy stressed

822
02:07:24,609 --> 02:07:32,824
and this is even in the middle of a pop OS
meltdown look at that don't have any
anything for my menu Cinema menu show
anything and I crazy

stupid thing fell because any time that I
want to pull up a base install and practice
installing cabinets from scratch I can go
through and I can do that 10 times I can do
it a dozen times I can give you guys a
bigger if I can do it yourself so you can
practice and selling communities over and
over again and you won't have to invest the
time and learning maker and you can just run
it right and you can't be a bit darker
because it doesn't have other things you
need to do this so this is the next best
thing that's why I'm going through this I am
going to try my hardest to keep to the
security said it all produce anything
resembling boost and some of the stuff I'm

imprisoned everywhere I translate for people
I'm not bragging I just tell you I invested
all that time and energy and fucking money I
spent thousands of dollars on that and now
what

919
02:24:42,285 --> 02:24:47,465
now what the only the only thing I can say
is that

920
02:24:48,979 --> 02:25:06,457
this is got to be a part of the plan this
part right here this part right here at this
whole streaming thing because if it didn't
have this ago fucking insane and and I'm
happy when I'm here I get frustrated because
people shit on me all the time but and then
they tell me that I shouldn't people

921
02:25:07,149 --> 02:25:10,868
is satellite as a second language on my God
that's so cool

922
02:25:11,877 --> 02:25:19,437
I have to meet another person around those
Latin last fucking amazing I I really really
wish I learned it

923
02:25:19,595 --> 02:25:28,560
it was she said it was going to be 32
degrees is supposed to be done

924
02:25:29,408 --> 02:25:46,352
that he they're saying that you already know
Russian literature and I actually just
continue to read in Russian and it reads as
I can in the biggest Advantage is and you
know what you're absolutely right thank you
for saying that hack the Box you remind me
there is something that I can do that other
people can't and they are a particular set
of skills

925
02:25:46,677 --> 02:25:50,811
and one of those skills is reading Russian
hacker boards

926
02:25:50,969 --> 02:25:56,886
I can more or less read Russian hacker
boards and

927
02:25:58,737 --> 02:26:07,386
it's something I'm sure it's a...

928
02:26:08,985 --> 02:26:16,964
Yes yes this is very much so Christy nuke
someone that's so cool

929
02:26:17,475 --> 02:26:31,761
yeah so so I will say that that's that has
been one of the advantages of it I mean
there's been other Advantage is my career my
early life was really related to my language
abilities and not so much my coding and
billing is more related to that

930
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:36,088
so that's why I'm done

931
02:26:37,163 --> 02:26:44,896
do you think about learning Russian and if
he does tell me right now busy spending a
little bit every day has been trying to
learn it

932
02:26:44,897 --> 02:27:14,554
is that they again I don't know if it's
everybody just needs to know this about me I
am a dumbass American man and I always use
he for people when they don't know their
gender and I'm a horrible person and I
apologize and try and Tuesday I honestly
don't know what your problem is I don't
really care to know so I do that all the
time I just I just don't want anybody to
think that I happen to know because I don't
and they would they might get the wrong
again

933
02:27:15,343 --> 02:27:20,822
most most most Americans don't give a shit
about anything except for what's right in
front of them

934
02:27:20,823 --> 02:27:28,561
and you can call me a negative person for
saying that I don't care I do not care

935
02:27:30,114 --> 02:27:35,574
is this Teresa Ashes Remain

936
02:27:36,667 --> 02:27:44,661
racism and there you go yeah we get a lot of
friends or friends from here up in here and
in France and Canada

937
02:27:44,661 --> 02:27:48,707
and I really really appreciate you being
here I really do you have no idea

938
02:27:48,970 --> 02:28:24,888
I really really do I do one of my first
thinking back you know two years of endeavor
streaming the first month a bunch of people
from friends came in and I was speaking
French with him in the whole entire night

the pop culture for bread set everything in
municipality and bunch of stuff and catching
up on all Donald's that's the last pop
culture from France I know it was years ago

absent spectacular and everything that piss

it sucks to be you and I wasn't putting
anybody down I was just

940
02:28:29,253 --> 02:28:38,868
we're going to do this might as well be a
little selfish sometimes play Little Richard
do a little French pop culture read some
Russian hacker boards

941
02:28:38,868 --> 02:28:43,261
go watch keep it again on the computer

942
02:28:43,261 --> 02:28:47,002
keep it it's cool you got the back here
again

943
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:52,859

944
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:57,758

945
02:28:57,758 --> 02:29:04,629

that many languages for their person that's
crazy

958
02:30:59,627 --> 02:31:01,823
that's crazy

959
02:31:10,925 --> 02:31:16,461
okay him docker

961
02:31:21,515 --> 02:31:29,295
sudo systemctl enable now Tucker

962
02:31:30,682 --> 02:31:37,306
to try one more time so I'm going to bed if
this works really try a reprovision

963
02:31:38,749 --> 02:31:43,986
they guarantee I keep typing it vagrant

964
02:31:47,952 --> 02:31:51,221
vagrant

sincerely trying to to know

967
02:32:37,272 --> 02:32:43,452
where is Russian at the University of that
Russian Russian 101 was the only 5 credit
hour class

968
02:32:45,503 --> 02:32:52,874
and I'm trying to figure out there I'm
trying to find a comfortable classes of of
some sort and I can compare it to you out
there

969
02:32:52,876 --> 02:33:05,342
because even you had she had to be so
immersed and I haven't be like a feeling
Chinese would have been four but I didn't we
didn't teach Chinese my number see I wish
they had all my God I wish they had the in
teaching

970
02:33:05,448 --> 02:33:13,108
no they didn't didn't teach any Asian
languages I don't think I did anything that
any Asian languages

971
02:33:14,426 --> 02:33:22,088
not that that's him and some other stuff but
not on there bam

972
02:33:29,066 --> 02:33:31,989
the Greek would be a great language to learn

973
02:33:34,067 --> 02:33:39,444
what's up what's that thing above the Matrix
that they say is Latin and it's actually
Greek

974
02:33:39,763 --> 02:33:47,247
Something There Goes soon can we rent it
until I get it wrong and Matrix and Matrix
has

975
02:33:46,058 --> 02:33:53,717
as the Matrix has a plaque above the door
when the grandmas eat incorrect got
chocolate chip cookies what's your face
torkoal

976
02:33:55,357 --> 02:33:59,790
it's something similar to go sooner whatever

977
02:34:01,232 --> 02:34:05,963
and it was written in Greek and everybody
says it's Latin the mix up all the time

978
02:34:07,913 --> 02:34:14,594
Siri, when I know that's all I got to say
it's finished.

979
02:34:15,670 --> 02:34:20,783
Vagrant SSH control

980
02:34:24,754 --> 02:34:32,728
stalker is here doctor PS is not that's a
read on it

981
02:34:33,302 --> 02:34:40,302

images sweet we are set to go you know that
means

983
02:34:47,485 --> 02:34:48,986
I don't know if I can

984
02:34:49,464 --> 02:35:04,329
so I'm going to do the docker compose
enticing us up again and I'm going to do the
me to give the test a single notifications
that's what I'd be doing all day tomorrow
but this is the thing I want to do because
you look we're now on

985
02:35:05,203 --> 02:35:10,646
assistant can I can pull down all kinds of
stuff on this and can you keep ATM

986
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:24,735
no they self that's the one right Tim and
yeah

987
02:35:28,041 --> 02:35:33,440
there's a comedian okay so this is great
because this is

988
02:35:33,656 --> 02:35:40,356
this is great we will finish everything
today we finish the whole the whole task I
finished the entire lab

989
02:35:40,989 --> 02:35:42,191
yep

990
02:35:44,433 --> 02:35:55,659
actually we finish this Force asking 383
virtual machines it took or Santa coming
around named Patrol

991
02:35:57,588 --> 02:36:04,025
control node one and no two

992
02:36:05,001 --> 02:36:08,885
receipts for the container engine in any
other Mission told you much

993
02:36:10,450 --> 02:36:15,588
and tomorrow night I'm going to be

994
02:36:16,144 --> 02:36:20,293
creating. How many days left abuse with 105
left

995
02:36:20,293 --> 02:36:26,109
I want to get this done I want to get this
done before our communities moose

996
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:47,943
before this and we only have till February
5th so we only have like 2 more weeks I want
to get this all done before we do that
because you actually do have a developer
boost we can do all of that in many Cube we
can do all this to me to give a kind we
don't need to do any of that application
developer assumes you have a nice
environment you don't have to install it
that's not part of it

997
02:36:47,946 --> 02:36:54,849
are you still online did you find it
diligent people yep

998
02:36:56,252 --> 02:36:59,260
did they put the right thing at the about
the thing

999
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:08,610
operatives how do you say it but they self

1000
02:37:10,304 --> 02:37:17,617
I'll just get you nowhere I need to put this
in the autodidact thing I do

1001
02:37:18,861 --> 02:37:23,129
I need $0.50 out of that I think cuz it's
cuz that's important thing

1002
02:37:24,138 --> 02:37:27,300
yeah it is let's do

1003
02:37:33,921 --> 02:37:40,797
stuff to put in the beginning ruse Terrell
scales going to be

1004
02:37:43,643 --> 02:37:50,096
wait I think I put it in the Boost directory
don't forget yeah

1005
02:38:20,946 --> 02:38:26,370
all right that is cool

1006
02:38:27,544 --> 02:38:31,892
then what what do we do have that where did
where did where is Saul comedian

1007
02:38:34,681 --> 02:38:38,983
I think I don't know

1008
02:38:40,088 --> 02:38:47,032
I think your attitude is so cute I am first
actually yeah that guy most positive

1009
02:38:49,213 --> 02:38:56,766
onto control this can be our task for
tomorrow

1010
02:38:57,336 --> 02:39:03,086
tonight anyway yep swana is 1 x 12

1011
02:39:05,392 --> 02:39:10,833
I'm going to want to go ahead and drop and

1012
02:39:11,959 --> 02:39:13,718
and see how things go

1013
02:39:18,549 --> 02:39:21,927
anyway I'm going to say this to anybody else
wants to follow along

1014
02:39:27,202 --> 02:39:33,595
I did get ignore vagrant

1015
02:39:37,364 --> 02:39:39,988
there we go

1016
02:39:44,969 --> 02:39:52,503
I get commence complete first task

1017
02:39:55,809 --> 02:40:00,405
Kid Flash yep

1018
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:12,374
I mean I don't use I don't need to do that
but here we go so there's a bigger file does
it does have it nice it's Ruby

1019
02:40:15,097 --> 02:40:17,179
so that's the solution

1020
02:40:17,785 --> 02:40:24,527
I can't figure out how to capture Solutions
of stuff in there I don't know how we need
to do that I said

1021
02:40:25,487 --> 02:40:30,100
and we have are you just has a task in it

1022
02:40:31,318 --> 02:40:38,949
if enemy have related we should probably go
the fear of the section we probably should
have links to the other lab to do those
other things

1023
02:40:39,468 --> 02:40:43,021
yep nice

1024
02:40:55,323 --> 02:41:15,682
I haven't you told him I don't know how I
feel about it I think it's nice that it's
been able to get much languages like Julian
Crystal and regionally rust a crystal music
but dumb I don't I don't know that makes me
like I think Joe is a much more of a work of
art because they were thrown off to my Scan
Power

1025
02:41:16,418 --> 02:41:22,692
and go self don't run time everything lvm
like kind of cheating

1026
02:41:22,888 --> 02:41:27,849
you can say that it's in a leveraging
existing thing blah blah blah but

1027
02:41:28,006 --> 02:41:35,614
it's a lot easier to make a language with
all them that it is which is sort of good
but dumb

1028
02:41:35,924 --> 02:41:43,546
that is a not sure if I like it oh yeah I'm
fucking huge fan of go-go as the most
important language on the planet right now

1029
02:41:43,547 --> 02:41:48,153
every every major cloud-native application
was written ago

1030
02:41:48,153 --> 02:41:52,555
every major one. He's dr. helm

1031
02:41:54,911 --> 02:41:59,914
whenever any form ethias

1032
02:42:00,807 --> 02:42:07,520
yeah they'll be an assembly so complex I
mean it it is easier so hard to

1033
02:42:08,430 --> 02:42:10,290
so

1034
02:42:10,290 --> 02:42:37,703
so yeah I do want to go programming on here
I just haven't done any lately I haven't
done any coronavirus right now I got a
really really take it up a notch on the
community service station stuff so I need to
stand up pretty fast I need a mailing
address for a class I need to fill out time
at bit when I'm not doing it I'm doing I'm
doing kotingo bash or something or whatever
whatever name the language today was Ruby

1035
02:42:37,705 --> 02:42:48,902
and I think you don't like putting all your
eggs in one basket and in like getting all
the tribal about a language really fucking
stupid actually it's really stupid do the
language that matches has to hand the end

1036
02:42:48,936 --> 02:42:58,067
and there's a few competitors for this
particular task but we can travel over
languages are stupid

1037
02:42:58,492 --> 02:43:00,629
and they do

1038
02:43:03,184 --> 02:43:07,091
so I no idea how big are actually has a huge

1039
02:43:05,944 --> 02:43:12,136
huge at Go-Go fits between Python and C

1040
02:43:13,347 --> 02:43:23,676
is there a my opinion my opinion you have a
simply see my liver you see on Friday and
Saturdays if your new we do see on Saturdays
we receive for 5 hours on Saturday we had
foreseen

1041
02:43:24,033 --> 02:43:30,357
so assembly see and then she was supposed to
be kind of share a spot

1042
02:43:30,784 --> 02:43:33,227
and then go

1043
02:43:34,501 --> 02:43:49,481
and above that you have you know the the
other compiled languages you probably Java
in terms of speed and level the level right
and then you get up to The Interpreter
language line Python and JavaScript review
parole

1044
02:43:49,806 --> 02:43:51,609
typescript whatever

1045
02:43:51,861 --> 02:44:00,597
so that's that's how they fit to me to me to
me Ruby I'm sorry and crystals actually
download there too

1046
02:44:01,153 --> 02:44:16,061
did you see you should see the bug they made
a big announcement about how awesome Ruby
about awesome rest of us today and elixir oh
yeah it looks a little too yeah but I'm
talking about like systems level images of
Department with you

1047
02:44:16,069 --> 02:45:00,463
I said a big a big to-do about the release
of rest today especially getting closer to
the colonel which is a total crush it at
shit I think it's so funny because the whole
world is totally being lied to and they
don't know they don't know it ain't nobody
bothers to read the actual emails exchanges
with Linda's revolves in the rest I don't
really give a shit they just read the blogs
and the Reddit posts in the stack exchange
series with a bunch of script kiddies
answering in a survey speakers are not
answering service and so I have to tell you
this though you still one of the things and
then in the rust blog and then rust thing
the progress thing was that they patched a
hole in in where the main system libraries
called command

1048
02:45:00,466 --> 02:45:12,014
which executes a shell and evaluates the
shell and executes a command that
automatically looked for any file in the
current. / directory

1049
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:26,910
and if you're a hacker you know an assist by
the clothes they close the small hole they
close the small hole that automatically ran
anything in the current directory

1050
02:45:27,063 --> 02:45:29,464
above anything else

1051
02:45:33,118 --> 02:45:59,299
and it was in the standard Library it was
mrs. I am so glad that you all know this I
am so glad that you are here and you can
know what I'm saying because the people who
write that blog have no fucking idea for us
to get to 2022 with that bug in the standard
Library

1052
02:45:59,527 --> 02:46:11,288
just demonstrates what a fucking klusterfuk
rust is it's such a klusterfuk they don't
even see why that's a problem like well we
close the minor problem

1053
02:46:11,552 --> 02:46:35,968
are you kidding me you can drive a truck
through at security vulnerability I mean
it's it just drives me nuts it just drives
me nuts because rest is safe oh yeah it's
just perfect according to mr. Twitter right
mr. Twitter says rust is perfect riffed safe
go use rust nothing bad will happen God damn
it they just it's just so damn terrifying

1054
02:46:35,970 --> 02:46:49,620
this so damn terrifying and it was like an
afterthought didn't even talk about it they
didn't even talk about it I was like you've
got to be kidding me that's like that's like
automatically putting. / in everybody's path

1055
02:46:49,994 --> 02:47:14,938
what's really crazy about that is it you
could even do the right thing you could have
had your path correctly set and rust threw
it away and put. / in the front of your path
that's how fucked-up that is it's so fucked
up and yet it didn't get any attention and
the only attention that got was this
language is really awesome everybody wants
to be in the colonel by the way it might be
a driver language

1056
02:47:14,944 --> 02:47:35,277
I can hold you should learn its do I have to
shut out of it the people that are renting
imagine imagine imagine if a bunch of drama
script script kiddies suddenly systems code
with Russ imagine imagine that world and
then they put all that code running has
roots on a desktop

1057
02:47:35,279 --> 02:47:43,401
if you're a hacker you need to fucking learn
it because these people that already have no
idea what they're doing they have no idea

1058
02:47:43,629 --> 02:47:47,346
they have no idea they had no idea and there
and they keep

1059
02:47:45,941 --> 02:48:06,817
and they and they keep trying to get the
language closer and closer and they were
anyone else they were Champion they're like
oh we have we have string Littles no-sew
log4j comes out right literally the same
like the week before or the week after log4j
comes out right so the week after log4j
comes out guess what

1060
02:48:07,409 --> 02:48:18,195
the week after log4j comes out rust goes in
there and block and they brag about having
string literals the same exact sort of thing
that was taken advantage of for log project

1061
02:48:18,444 --> 02:49:18,921
and they're safe as far as I know I haven't
checked and I kind of want to they're safe
but they're bragging about hey guess what we
did we put string literals inside of our
strings just like everybody else and they're
like wait this awful lot like a Syntax for
the lock for jair are you sure you're not
evaluating anything besides just symbols and
stuff in there and I no no no we're doing it
perfectly safe and they probably are they
probably are differently on that particular
one I don't know but it's like they keep
solving problems that JavaScript people want
to have fixed you know they keep solving
these like tiny ass stupid thing from the
JavaScript world that that are not anywhere
near so it doesn't know what it wants to be
one second and wants to be the next
JavaScript it was a real problem was there
ever a semi next time I want to replace the
in the Linux kernel it doesn't have any idea
what it wants to be in his nobody were in
the ship and everybody on the moderators
team quit in disgust it's a it's a total
disaster if I were a company I cannot
believe

1062
02:49:18,928 --> 02:49:21,748
the people that are putting their companies
at risk

1063
02:49:21,963 --> 02:49:49,152
by biting it. I cannot believe it and they
think that it's a safer language I'll tell
you when it's okay it's just a foreign
language but you just put in the biggest
vulnerability and since the shell shell
shocked and you didn't even tell anybody
about it and you're lucky nobody caught you
on it you know I didn't catch you on it
because you haven't done anything
significant in Rust at all if there have
been any significant application done is for
us that use the command application I
guarantee it would have been exploited by
hackers have been giving a shit

1064
02:49:49,193 --> 02:50:24,435
but now it's time to give a shit when you go
hack the shit out of the only time the only
the only way you can bring The Shining Light
of Shame on something like rust after it's
gotten so beloved is to hack the shit out of
it and embarrassed at the death shame it to
death shame is creators to death and put it
out there for everybody to see what a
klusterfuk of a disaster it is so that it
can get on its way off of the you know that
the top of the hill of hype and then down
into the trough of disillusionment so we can
get on with real work and as I said I still
think she could be used for a lot of real
work but right now it's just like

1065
02:50:24,486 --> 02:50:30,397
yeah but after I saw that go container with
sleep takes 250 MB

1066
02:50:30,897 --> 02:50:38,097
that doesn't and now it doesn't that is I
don't know what you're looking at

1067
02:50:38,098 --> 02:50:46,077
I go container does not take that much it
was it a from scratch container I can do it
go from scratch container into MB and have

1068
02:50:46,407 --> 02:50:51,864
I don't know what you're talkin about
different trash container you'll see the
difference

1069
02:50:52,323 --> 02:50:59,359
I said I don't think it's 25 MB I'd be
really surprised python is definitely MB

1070
02:50:59,642 --> 02:51:03,876
that means you're like eliminating all the
standard library or something

1071
02:51:04,733 --> 02:51:07,854
are they going to hack

1072
02:51:07,854 --> 02:51:23,787
I'd actually did that comparison we did one
and see you what we should do on Saturday or
something we should do we should do a French
catch the hello world from presbyterian rust
Hill Road from scratch A and B on a whole
different computer and go as we can see you
again that we can hit we can evaluate then
once I'm outside

1073
02:51:23,974 --> 02:51:29,126
yeah go doesn't come with much many more
batteries included them

1074
02:51:29,293 --> 02:51:35,366
I don't know why would you ever put go in
Alpine that's ridiculous

1075
02:51:35,606 --> 02:52:15,383
absolutely ridiculous no need. That's that's
that's a fundamental misunderstanding of
containers in my opinion the whole point of
go the reason go is the darling of container
land is because you can do from scratch
containers that you can never ever ever do
with python by the NFL have felt whole
fucking OS do a French catch container and
you drop all the OS there's no ass at all
it's just a single container that has all
everything built in that you want and really
Kick-Ass in today she pee and everything
else when you're going on a good idea to see
you guys I got to go get the baby ready I'll
give it a shot though

1076
02:52:18,264 --> 02:52:24,804
we can raid forgotten VCR I love forgotten
VCR we're getting these are really fun

1077
02:52:24,804 --> 02:52:28,093
and that whoever does forgot to be sure they
work really hardyeah they work really hard
at it

1078
02:52:28,930 --> 02:52:33,600
so have fun tell him I please tell him hello
for me by

1079
02:52:46,098 --> 02:52:46,795
all right by everybody
