1
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:35,114
hey there buddy I'm just going we're just
waiting and getting started here pretty soon

2
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,525
there's going to be a lot of visual stuff
today but if you want if you want to just
listen go for it we are

3
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:52,321
on to extend these days I go on stage and
Discord and I do too much at the same time

4
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:57,997
so I'll be starting here in about another 3
minutes maybe 5 minutes

5
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:27,543
I wish there was a way to send audio and
video to just go to the same time

6
00:02:56,838 --> 00:03:00,059
great we can have a great weekend I was just
really busy as usual

7
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,626
all right

8
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,727
get her going to that my mom's got my
smoothies almost gone

9
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:20,752
is are we going to do we're going to be

10
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:32,563
and you doing kind of a speedrun I'm going
to do this probably several times because I
want to get really good at it going to be
installing kubernetes from absolute scratch
and probably hit a number of Kinks along the
way

11
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:53,824
and we now have a entirely provisioned
environment virtual environment to do this
with one vagrant command we built that big
red boat that vagrant file last week man
that included setting up nfs4 storage class
all of which went right

12
00:03:55,198 --> 00:04:02,677
can you go for me be able to monitor the
underlying volume of a PVC so I can see when
is running out of space

13
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,167
all right

14
00:06:25,602 --> 00:07:04,876
so here I am talking into mute again sorry
about that thank you for the reminder so I'm
down to nothing if there's like a noise you
please let me know we can be going through
this pretty quickly I'm going to be
answering questions except when I'm going to
be trying to focus on installing communities
as fast as possible I will be rubber ducky
in talking about through what I'm doing but
the goal here is for me to remember as much
as possible I'm only referring to documents
that are on communities that I owe and then
get home communities project which by the
way reminds me why you need somewhere to go
if you want to get good at this stuff if you
could have to see me until the activities
project

15
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:12,749
actually let's try this my wife is also
going to be

16
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:20,910
vacuuming unfortunately nothing I can do
about that so kubernetes

17
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,617
pandemic

18
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:34,671
the cube ATM application where is Covidien

19
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,844
what is it injury

20
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:47,999
it is an argument again how's it going

21
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:54,170
so when you go under two minutes let's do
this g h repo cologne

22
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:58,165
ronettis / Cube ATM

23
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:05,956
and we're going to see into Cube ATM and
this is the source code

24
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:52,695
of could get a comedian Tortura news today
give me a damn fool was built to provide
best practices and Fastpass for critical
base cluster is it supposed to quote a
Kelsey Hightower hard way which means
involving any of your information your own
certificates in anything and installing a
specific executables which is no longer a
thing for the most telling signs of how
outdated that tutorial is Kelsey Hightower
that the hard way is that did it installs
keep Roxie which is now included as a as a
dam and said within the kuebler so it's very
outdated nobody should be doing it if a
phone is actually this is her to get a
minimum viable secure coaster and running as
soon as a friendly way give ATM is a way to
do this give me a new scope with local found
on system

25
00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:19,734
and it carries a plan is intended to be
composed of a building block however the
tools if you install a certificate
certificate will be managed by the ATM
upgrade that you do every time you upgrade
it will get new certs an update for you so
you have to worry about the certs Etc, and
Kim and let's in it and Bubba on sale cuz
you can go into

26
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,907
the source code forlook for comedian

27
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:28,350
I want where is it where was it looking at I
can't find it now

28
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:35,157
what to do if I think this just might be

29
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,707
hey Tammy that's why I don't have it

30
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,648
documentation is Socrates cranking requested
on my way to be falling all these stocks
with me

31
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,246
all the stuff is included this is all
communities documentation it's a lot
freezing

32
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:04,490
but I was looking for the source code and I
can't find it now exclusive all the labs in
left shoulder

33
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:21,139
no I deleted a move. Cuz yesterday cuz all
they're all the lads into a single a
directory and that's I'm going to recommend
other people do going forward to having him
spread out all over creation and get him as
a total mess and it's completely
unsearchable so I'm putting them all in one

34
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:28,819
yeah I mean is that about that so

35
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:33,889
I know where you're going to put it

36
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,801
give me the kind made

37
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,088
Billy Craig get

38
00:10:55,999 --> 00:11:01,503
extreme what's the route the route Kinder
Cobra car or back and then go broken in

39
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,516
and I think they renamed it

40
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,563
where they put I know I found this somewhere
and I can't find it again

41
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,899
there's this the source code for curium has
the phases in it

42
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,024
I want to say that's probably not The Source
cover. And I know that sounds weird but

43
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:35,072
and I also goes down goals if you just
versus it would be kinder

44
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:42,315
Canon 70-200 by kind kind of share the same
qualities that I find this interesting

45
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:48,662
this is this is toilet why haven't even seen
this before that's interesting

46
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,721
I didn't think you even was an operator

47
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:03,346
I don't know if this is what we're even
looking at actually

48
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:07,891
I don't think it is actually I think this is
something else

49
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:19,015
where's the source code I can't find it now

50
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:42,649
oh there we go that's why I feel better I
don't feel so stupid so they can at it and
that's why I didn't have that repo I don't
have any code in it it's just for
aggravating issues the actual command is on
the community CMD okay that makes sense yeah
yeah it was literally the first line I was
like why don't I have the repo

51
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:51,288
cuz you don't need it is just documentation
right so let's go

52
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:58,148
+ 2 communities

53
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,998
it's okay and composes also included now

54
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:09,668
Mario yeah God I was cuz like was in the
brain

55
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:18,270
arioso this this is how you know what it
does I don't know I mean I don't remember
which one I looked at but

56
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:23,834
comedian that uses Cobra was just pain in my
ass but whenever

57
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:34,277
virgin blah blah blah blah Ukrainian command

58
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:42,083
and pre-flight concerts U2

59
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:51,157
Camilla Market in we did that one already we
need to go

60
00:13:52,814 --> 00:14:00,690
Cindy faces yes there we go see the phases

61
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,433
there isthere is there's all the phases so

62
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:09,023
see the command that we wanted when we do
qbdm

63
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:18,245
in it which is the command that we run right
to keep it in and it is the command we're
going to be running and here's the source
code

64
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:26,409
so do they make note of that so that is

65
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:32,060
acumen in it again and

66
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:41,278
can you show me a sentence of a successful
look like chart because it is

67
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:45,978
go to Simplot and it options are in so

68
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:49,575
you cannot break down the source code and
follow along

69
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:59,622
new commanding it returns returns to give me
the command OK Google, command and it run
the command in order to see set of Human
Rights control plane

70
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:06,566
I think we have to go to the API actually

71
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:30,976
append face and it runner-up in Phase new
pre-flight phase new certs phase New Cube
config phase so each one of these phases is
an abstraction of how you used to have to
install communities by hand so if you want
to read what those faces are doing you can
go read the code there and you can see how
how all the phases go down

72
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:38,672
you can actually run a specific a security
and then we're going to get ahead of myself
so it's nice to have this code up to see
what's up

73
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:45,528
but you know and how much that that matters
to people

74
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,944
actually do you want to remember what that
is so I can make a note

75
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,419
how can a cat go

76
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,220
app see you Monday and It. Go

77
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:41,008
I'm not going to put a related section when
I'm tired of it

78
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:52,655
can be very enlightening read the source

79
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:11,152
can you read this source of the qbdm command
which was created specifically

80
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:19,370
to codify and standardizing codify

81
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:26,955
and codify the steps of creating

82
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:32,596
a kubernetes from scratch

83
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,542
insulation

84
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:43,682
can I have a reference to that

85
00:17:44,645 --> 00:18:18,860
all the time so I want to make out a list
reset or things in the right place we're
going to make allowed to this and in case
you don't know I confirm I can combine
everything into a single Aviary bill so if
you want to follow all of the experimental
work Explorations and blowing things up you
can just go to my lab director so all of the
stuff I do indication why it's going to be
in the lab or is that anything that's
another project is a project you know I can
get them refunded

86
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:27,479
so we're to meet living in case I'm going to
your favorite local committee man

87
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:34,964
I don't even know if when you could call it
that

88
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:41,090
we can probably call it something else it
doesn't have to be vagrant local

89
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:53,002
I mean I guess it could be Hardway doctor
yeah it's a different one I'm not going to
talk about Alan

90
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:58,280
the Securities that are we using Docker
which is a fail he can't do it

91
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,146
I kind of want to change this

92
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:18,920
I don't want to call it all of that I want
to call it Q ATM or from scratch right

93
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,663
they just call it from Q ATM

94
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,806
Wesley College

95
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:45,037
give me a decent DVD and let's do that it

96
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:07,164
they aren't you oh yeah absolutely we're
going to say going again right here so

97
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:12,956
is it from Peabody I'm going to write this
the zoo

98
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:22,826
install

99
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:29,639
it's all coronavirus setups communities from
Kam

100
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:40,056
no it's my my wife vacuum

101
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:47,760
it's all over it nope don't do that is so
they're going to configure for the vert new
Patek on to that

102
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:56,180
I'm going to write this I'm going to write
the steps as if someone else wants to do
this lab

103
00:20:57,086 --> 00:21:03,410
yeah this way by the way I can also put on
my notes in here

104
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,405
temperature the next workstation better Mi
install virtualbox

105
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:16,370
install vagrant

106
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,992
are indebted to Lenox absolutely Lennox all
the way

107
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:38,721
I need to make a cloud image of

108
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:58,925
I don't know how to say this we need to do

109
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:11,907
stand up the

110
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,689
nfsc

111
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,246
fragrance

112
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:39,322
and if n f s test vagrants environments

113
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:51,109
so I'm going to watch in this

114
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,051
work is going on too so this stuff right
here is already done

115
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:02,245
so this is it that my modifying is little
bit

116
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:12,970
I was if I saw that this event has been
modified over the right so

117
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,689
where did I need to do any of this anymore
so this this actually is way overdue has a
really bad one

118
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:28,498
and this was actually doing external storage
attached you don't have to do that anymore
all of this stuff is like bad

119
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:39,799
so this is the part where I wanted Like
Larry my learning I don't want to have to
repeat myself

120
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:45,118
when I learn as I hate go to this thing and
get up to this one spot here and then we go
on from there

121
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:59,522
and this provision file swappa anomalous
suffocate we do need to do all of this stuff

122
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:04,727
we do need to do all this stuff so

123
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,856
so yeah

124
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:25,204
we're trying to decide if we should if we
should have asked if we should have the if
you should have the lab say hey go sit up
there, Nate is box wax on wax out or if we
should have

125
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:27,638
or if we should have it still

126
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:36,014
yeah this you don't need any of this stuff
anymore no you don't need this

127
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:43,252
continue run time there's a net for certain
that we already known that filters on
because we checked it

128
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:55,895
alright so you know what I'm just going to
copy it I mean copy it

129
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:13,867
but first learn of it.

130
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:19,897
Learn how to

131
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:25,253
set up 3 machine

132
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:33,748
NFS vagrant 3

133
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:42,105
3 v m s hey Grinch memes

134
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:48,157
with n f s animals

135
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:56,774
all right so we already did that I did that
and I separated at that learning it was a
separate task to we're going to build on top
of that right

136
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,851
this is two quarters 2 GB Ram 10 GB storage
name control control another one or two

137
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:21,977
I would imagine he thinks he's with Sandra
Kennedy's components in administrative
Cheetos image credit NFS volume create a
small NFS volume and out all your systems at
the same amount point

138
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:26,046
at the same at one location / s

139
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:42,005
set up SSH login to from control to node in
your regenerated certs I don't know if we
actually need to do this part this is just
an administrative thing I feel like that
could come later

140
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:51,249
I can say bonus

141
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:59,403
setup SSH logins ice cream now

142
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:06,372
no we're not going is icy at all here
nothing on the worker notes though

143
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:09,597
no

144
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:22,766
I think about that why would we not met him
on over for nodes

145
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:38,594
yeah but okay that means the storage class
setup on the control box is able to
communicate storage over the network

146
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:43,813
what you're implying is that the storage
class provider for an FS

147
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:50,878
takes care of the network mounting and I
don't need him out Amon then points which

148
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,367
and if that's true then yeah we don't need
to

149
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:04,671
that let me know and that would mean that
there's some sort of magical proxy and going
a lot goingboxing going a lot going on in
the NFL stores class provider

150
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:08,945
yeah I would be able to chat. We don't want
that

151
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:16,802
it is a curious company of traction with a
small and if it's volume

152
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:30,844
at the slashes Melt point

153
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:40,000
it should be able to be mounted from the

154
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:43,340
and their workers from the nodes

155
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:50,253
workers but don't Mount them

156
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:58,134
acores class provider will cover that

157
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:06,450
cover a remote access yeah

158
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:37,872
so you're saying that that that joke already
knows about mounting a defense school I
learned that something to learn today that's
why I'm doing this I want to understand how
that provision of storage and then if it
still works best with our which is pretty
basic requirement for a community's install
vagrant they're not a set of 3 mg with nfsnl
so if you don't know that you need to learn
how to do that we do spend a lot of time
already knew that I haven't done so much I'm
going to just put me on the riverbank and
fall over

159
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:44,951
I don't know what I put my post position
here PostScript I remove post

160
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:51,837
vagrants when I can't so we're finally in
the right places to Mike's in here

161
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,657
and let's do

162
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:10,430
this provision file takes care of the other
stuff that we need to do we actually know a
lot of time doing this we were able to get
container ID working without Docker real sex
in the road project but we're not going to
talk about that right now

163
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:23,578
yeah we we've had extensive conversations
about rook and and and staff and all that
and and we're doing that but you've still
got to know how to use NFL

164
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:32,436
nfsi directory external provider versus a
savannah Fest mount

165
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,918
what it what is this

166
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:47,068
what is it is infested electric drum
provisioner

167
00:30:49,873 --> 00:31:04,973
there's a dark servers are not a word that
uses your existing already could be going to
fist over I was just personal information or
giving a person a ways away we still have to
join our things and get it up get the system
right

168
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:11,715
this is fantastic though let's definitely
add this to the list of things

169
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:19,163
that's what this is all about all these
notes

170
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,625
I need to make sure it's standard though

171
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:52,579
and if anything is like out not standard and
I don't I don't want to use it I want to use
it as much out of the box stuff that people
would expect to use as possible that would
include I don't want to disrupt her stuff
and things like that because I do want to
learn that stuff going forward but I'm
dealing with like older architectures that
how you know the things that I have to
support that's why I'm sticking with it is
Play No Limit Fest

172
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:58,037
I'm a crazy person volume we have to do it
manually

173
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:01,497
well what I want to know is

174
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:10,672
actually I need to look in our internal
structure for our internal system for our
storage class provider for NFS I need to go
look at my phone or anything

175
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:23,412
yeah wow

176
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:28,723
yeah

177
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:41,455
does surprise me at all how people can lose
their shirt on that shit

178
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,737
alright so

179
00:32:48,188 --> 00:33:10,187
we already went through all this provision
we actually got a community's cluster ready
to run qbdm on it this part is already been
done so and I'm going to clean up this file
and improve it right now as a bunch of shit
we don't need in it and I'm going to talk
about what I mean by that so we already did

180
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:29,529
an NFS vagrant file and thanks for the help
from LBG we've got it so that it's really
fucking amazing very slight of hand and it
uses the modern experimental stuff

181
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:56,700
and in this is this is like way better than
than anything else will be with you I'm
actually going to copy this in type to send
again because it could for the sake of
learning so the new disc external just
provider does not need the name of the debts
you can do that if you want if you want to
have your disk file be local but you really
don't give a shit the big thing that I miss
and I lost a lot of time when was setting
these environment variables and I'm going to
put those right here

182
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:05,111
and so we're going to use virtualbox as a
provider of a very experimental

183
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:10,131
control node one in 02

184
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:32,658
and this is another thing it's another cool
trick from Ruby which gives you if you do
with index you get a number which we can use
to establish a IP addresses that are
inconsistent and that is something that I
spent a lot of time trying to learn

185
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:35,477
so we're going to we're going to leave that
in there

186
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:44,803
all right so so we have a config do you have
the name do the node

187
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:51,035
we're going to stick with Alma give me the
same hostname do the provider stuff

188
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:56,900
Orange Box we tried link loan at didn't work
last time

189
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:02,243
link cloning didn't work I wish it would
still problem without any to remove that
actually

190
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:14,586
so then we have is a memory

191
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:25,578
we need the specifications on the cube ATM
sites say you need to get at least two gigs
of RAM on the controller Jen's going to have
one

192
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,471
urgent matters including onl

193
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:43,374
but what I'm trying to figure out how to add
the batteries in the way that is consistent
with my environment so you know they're
probably better ways out there but I want to
be able to change the batteries

194
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:50,219
no I don't think Lincoln was ever working I
didn't throw an error though

195
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:55,919
I mean I don't know we can leave it it's not
hurting

196
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:08,001
maybe. Was going to bite me after feeling

197
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:15,005
I mean it's not it's not going to hurt so
that's just about it

198
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:22,405
Digimon Tri everybody think cloned keeps it
from pulling the bass down every time or
something like that

199
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:30,076
Vivi memory 2048 unless you're the control

200
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:37,930
I see now that memory we wanted to be 1024
this is for the averages

201
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:45,891
and see if you really want someone save you
we only want one see if you

202
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:53,283
what's the upper Vega file we talked about

203
00:36:53,981 --> 00:37:01,806
this file is the new one I'm doing for
kubernetes this is my old nfs1 only

204
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:08,548
this is going to have different parameters I
thought about just copying over Direct

205
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:21,525
there is a lot of stuff that we don't need
in it that was based on original
configuration before I knew about the
experimental stuff like all this file exists
shit we don't need that I may be going here
pretty soon so see if he is memory

206
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:25,446
fuse memory okay

207
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:52,733
meet this is the oldest one this is the one
I had back for I knew anything about that
stuff the one on the bottom is a nice clean
happy one that you helped me make and so if
Nichols control I want to see if use this is
how you would normally do disc in the old
days when I can do that we're going to do
the newfangled way of doing disc which is a
lot easier

208
00:37:54,168 --> 00:38:02,788
this is if you be even now recognize this
either if we switch to text or just like so
much easier it's so much easier

209
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,905
else here

210
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:18,984
yeah I think we can if you want to spend
some pods

211
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:26,245
yeah yeah why not

212
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:36,105
yeah I'm just going by the recommendations
from the side so

213
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:44,656
remember that we probably should have an
else in here because

214
00:38:45,422 --> 00:39:00,209
I mean I can do I can have an overrated but
this is just as well so they don't have the
same memory we're going to give to see if
use to control otherwise we're going to give
one of you if we have control we're also
going to mount a disc

215
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,228
so no. Rihanna.

216
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:19,655
All right so there we go

217
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:26,579
and

218
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:35,464
then we need to do the Shelf we going to run
out of provisioner which is down here we
have that as well

219
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:42,338
and it doesn't have to go in here in this
could be and takeaways from retrieving your
dad

220
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:51,550
I mean we don't need any provision just get
off cuz this is just in case you want to
resize this which is the new thing I found
out did not know that before

221
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:58,753
so in a vision v a vision

222
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:05,489
traffic is so this is going to run the
provisioner to the network first though

223
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:11,362
we didn't hear but I don't know

224
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:15,091
actually kind of think we should do that
first saw you

225
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:20,124
you should see the network stuff before the
random permit last version of script

226
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:46,781
so are we going to run the provisions for it
but this doesn't it scp's the file over and
runs it on the system or SSH is on I don't
know how but it gets it effectively it gets
in on their runs it because you can put the
file in a in a separate syntax if you have
been in the networking thing however we did
spend quite a bit of time setting up

227
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:54,062
and I really love it so a couple of the
conclusions here vagrant does not

228
00:40:54,274 --> 00:41:30,307
it gives by The Faults of bug open on it
this book here this thing here fixes the
fact that it doesn't assign individual Mac
address to the to the virtual machines they
all have the same one and that's annoying
and wrong and then confuse the shit out of
his money and I saw it and so we're going to
turn it over to make out of Mac address even
if it's not really needed because of the
nodding that happens by default everything
gets an address so they don't get the same
IP and say mac address by the Falls if you
don't change anything but if you put

229
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:37,850
yeah if we if we put

230
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,449
let me put this year

231
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:48,489
but that's all I can find in your face which
is not really needed as you said yeah

232
00:41:49,245 --> 00:42:01,966
so yeah and we need the eye peas so this is
a trick I think that what you came up with
which uses Ruby's ability to assign so if
you in all the examples you'll see

233
00:42:00,534 --> 00:43:01,003
you know the example just so you know that
being Network private Network like this
seemed like a why are you doing this can't
we just use the default Network and you
actually can you connect to station to that
do all kinds of things but if you want the
VM to be able to talk to each other you have
to do apparently according to me you just an
interface has added with know that being
that we're getting random acts yes he's
getting random at Candy's anytime you're
doing anything with more than one pm and you
wanted to talk to each other make sure you
have a no. Damn Network the end you'll never
have the problem if you don't and every
example they have it but I was like well do
I really need it and then I added and it
works you can listen to everything they just
can't talk to each other actually you know
you can ping each other you just can't talk
to each other by AP which is the whole point
so just add it and if more than one you
might as well do this method because then
you can actually give them consistent IP
numbers that you can in right in your
provisional because your provisional
diagnosis specific IP address in a provision
script and that that's cool

234
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:10,678
is that means you can script Network related
things like an FS Mouse and stuff and that's
what we did down here so

235
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:13,440
so there

236
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:45,464
yeah we were just being ourselves by oh my
God it's working again and then we just
figure out that way it's not going anywhere
that was the strangest debug session I've
had in a long time because I was not
expecting it to be painting itself because
it had the same address and it wasn't it
didn't but we looked at the route said
everything or like wait a second this isn't
riding anywhere it's just going to itself
that was that was some crazy crazy stuff
expert coz on cell

237
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:55,368
so there I think I think this is enough
actually now let's go ahead and get this
Invader up this I'm going to actually

238
00:43:55,705 --> 00:44:11,563
it's always the case for Network
troubleshooting guess but I mean seriously
fighting the same Mac address come on that
that is not a normal troubleshooting
Discovery everything at the same time when
you know Mac addresses were soldered onto
the board and

239
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:36,323
no virtualization is like totally blown that
away and extreme amount of work to get this
to work this actually when you when you
finish running this you have a working
kubernetes but I might do it all from
scratch even though I have a script for it
so because

240
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:41,156
you know I'm going to put down here going to
put

241
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:52,213
you know what Let's do let's have to
provisioner scripts yeah let's break it up
let's have let's have one that says

242
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:59,101
base and then let's have

243
00:45:00,337 --> 00:45:11,659
keabadian okay so that way we have two
Provisions right we have a base runner which
we can get rid of this one now think

244
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:20,062
so now we have a base base provisioner that
gets that gets you base and Fs communities
yeah

245
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:25,419
well that we have an offence already right

246
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:34,351
no we don't we don't have enough s I'm going
to open that up again god dammit

247
00:45:35,227 --> 00:45:42,530
we don't have enough fast we didn't we
didn't do it we didn't add the provisioning
sections renfest I realize now

248
00:45:42,669 --> 00:45:53,525
if this provision so yes I think you're
right there we go yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes

249
00:45:53,526 --> 00:45:58,633
IC base manifest

250
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:03,003
and given him and we'll keep the Basin FS
off

251
00:46:03,076 --> 00:46:29,683
I think it's a great idea and things have
been a little early because here's the thing
sometimes you want to bring up the
environment at a different level to practice
your skills like do you want to practice
doing infest by hand like you have the
solution right there a written information
file right that's how you do it but if you
want to practice it as an exercise you might
want to leave it off so yeah let's break
that up let's break that up right now so
what's the

252
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:37,184
I'm a copy this provision to base and Fs and
Canadian

253
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:43,426
I don't know we have been too but Iwe have
been too but I don't know if you needed

254
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,861
I mean I have a separate activity for
setting up NFS mounts

255
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:04,685
you know make this into mace

256
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:14,113
copy base into alright so

257
00:47:15,834 --> 00:48:16,202
hanging files yeah I have if you want it if
you want the NFL have someone there it is
right here I have a working and if this was
entirely scripted Professor exp was welcome
welcome welcome let's see anybody who wants
to follow along all the stuff is in my lab
repo and it's under so the nfs1 is entirely
under and it has a Raider the NFS one is
entirely under and it will it will this is
finished we have this completely working and
we got that working because of what he's a
storage cost nothing but as you know we've
been talkin we might not need all that so
Lexie doing multiple levels here so we're
going to say so first of all of us get it to
work so just brings up it just brings up
let's try that I'm just like that and never
going to bring up the bass

258
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:32,928
and then we'll add layer on and if snrk so
with the with the community stuff we only
need two layer on the base to get has a kill
and everybody thank you Raiders I wish I
knew

259
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:39,072
I could probably go check my cervix be out
how's it going

260
00:48:40,595 --> 00:48:43,700
yeah fantastic

261
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:53,619
time to go over to your site here I don't
have that thing that recommends people you
know but I'm sure they can click on your
name

262
00:48:54,924 --> 00:48:58,340
so so what are we doing here we're going

263
00:48:59,477 --> 00:49:03,112
everybody said you Humble Bundle didn't you
didn't say I was pretty

264
00:49:03,372 --> 00:49:35,679
all right so we have so if we just rented a
car as is everything should work and we
should have our networking setup right I
think let's go check and make sure are we
looking at our provisioning that is all
right so I turned swap off just cuz there's
no real reason to we turned off the firewall
we disable the firewall for NFS that goes in
the Manifest stuff let me know if it's all
in a client so this stuff actually goes as
is

265
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:38,852
hell we can probably just

266
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:51,221
the swap off stuff needs to go in the cube
ATM that's a cube ATM requirement that is
not a requirement of other stuff

267
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:59,907
I mean we probably could put the container
engine stuff in it provisioning file make it
say

268
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:06,668
yeah I mean we could almost make this into
multiple files you know and if ask Integrity
run time

269
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:13,729
I kind of feel like we could do that ya SE
Lennox

270
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:34,460
I mean disabling iconx and just say when the
fire all that kind of stays in base all
right let's let's let's do this let's go
back to basis what needs to be in base okay
so we need we need I am update yeah we need
that right we don't need any fests this is
all specific

271
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:44,328
they don't need to sit by the tables rules
for that we don't need that disabling
selinux that that's kind of a base thing
that we're going to do it and probably don't
need to do that

272
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:48,632
let me try without it

273
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:59,981
let's try without it I think you can do
without it let's try that the firewall we
don't need to disable the firewall anymore
we know that

274
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:05,281
now and this is all the community stuff
which we definitely need

275
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:11,609
and this is his we can do the communities
installation so is this

276
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:18,085
and then we just have to give a damn server
and that's all I don't think there's much
stuff to go in base

277
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:21,957
I was afraid the colonel yeah I mean

278
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:28,042
I mean yeah that would be fun but I don't I
don't know what kind of raw night yeah

279
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:32,071
kernel upgrade Hi how are you

280
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:41,771
kernel upgrade hi there you know not not at
the moment thank you

281
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:45,357
power wheels for communities where do you
have that

282
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:56,052
yeah we'll definitely need final rules I
wonder if there's a fire will command for
kubernetes yet I assume no so

283
00:51:58,339 --> 00:52:03,875
and for the colonel that in there to do

284
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:19,730
I would rather not turn it off as someone
asks if we can avoid it cuz that's obviously
nothing you would do in production right

285
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:28,507
I don't even know if you needed them update
why why do we have any update in there we
don't need it

286
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,439
when I doing an installation right

287
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:39,398
I am thinking that people are sick. I don't
want to fire yum update off and go through
all that shit every time

288
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:44,597
besides we have to add a config manager
before we leave update anyway

289
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:49,676
so you know what I mean I don't want to do
it twice it's a pain in the ass

290
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:59,183
cni for the firewall yeah that's true that's
true the point

291
00:52:59,824 --> 00:53:07,672
alright so we got the colonel afraid Cube
ATM

292
00:53:10,826 --> 00:53:16,248
swap is off and if us know we can put it
into something

293
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:21,500
Henry run time I kind of feel like a you
could be in its own

294
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:29,484
people would say that container D is not a
part of kubernetes so let's let's do that

295
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:33,043
let's copy Cube ATM to container you

296
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:50,566
I like breaking it down like this because I
strictly speaking they don't even list can
they can they can hear her engines on the
community's components webpage it's not a
part of the standard engine components it's
supposed to say prerequisite to kubernetes
it so and I'm putting it in Coop Cube ATM is
kind of

297
00:53:52,780 --> 00:54:00,741
because out there so again this is this is
only necessary

298
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:06,073
because container team yes

299
00:54:06,432 --> 00:54:12,948
swap is not a container anything container
tea is a thing

300
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:17,504
Amazon container negativity default

301
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:25,961
and then we execute that turn on Bering air
filter which is an air filter Bridge

302
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:33,871
since the smoothies versus crushing boots

303
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:43,874
yeah I feel like this is not part of
container do you

304
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:59,674
sissy tell from her sis vs. Coronavirus I
feel like I don't

305
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:10,956
I also don't think we need to turn off well
we could just turn off the firewall

306
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:15,614
and we can figure out how to configure the
phone

307
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:23,169
ain't this time we're getting ahead of
ourselves let's go back let's go back to
base there's nothing in base all right so

308
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:29,120
I don't think we need to disable sunix we
might want to come over here

309
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:54,351
black the bike everyday is I know I saw say
about you talk about the poor for her stuff
yeah. Yeah I think we need to dive into the
firewall stuff so let's that's I don't want
to disable the firewall I don't have changed
my mind on that I think disabling the
firewall is cheating you would never do that
at least I don't think you would

310
00:55:54,354 --> 00:56:02,050
let me know if you're if you're on a trusted
Network internal Network I guess you could
no but we don't want to

311
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:07,379
but we don't want to do that because a lot
of people installing kubernetes in his
public facing right I don't want to do this

312
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:12,254
fix me I do fire all right

313
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:17,242
I want to do that alright so

314
00:56:18,192 --> 00:56:30,837
so what what do we have here so do do do do
do do do for however

315
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:39,656
I do believe this is not an FS not an FS not
an FS

316
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,779
this is an FS not an FS

317
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:52,232
not and if that's not an FS not an FS no
communities

318
00:56:53,232 --> 00:56:55,802
American face connect with private switch

319
00:56:56,608 --> 00:57:01,771
a separate private network interface
connected to a private to switch interesting

320
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:14,327
when turn that off from keyboard off
computer 8 a.m. up all right I think we can
actually add r n f s provisioning

321
00:57:14,885 --> 00:57:21,285
stuff here and we don't necessarily

322
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:39,092
so and I only get one line. What the hell

323
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:50,442
alright so we get a new firewall

324
00:57:53,298 --> 00:58:00,987
I don't know if we need to do a fresh update
we shouldn't need that

325
00:58:01,197 --> 00:58:12,755
I mean let's put a very uncommon it out we
don't need it I don't seem to be from an NFS
reload yum install NFS utils are busy mind

326
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:21,435
and we do that everywhere at this is there's
no and if it's over

327
00:58:22,671 --> 00:58:27,481
yeah it's just an offense utils in terms of
packages

328
00:58:27,689 --> 00:58:32,571
and those name is control then mounted

329
00:58:32,572 --> 00:58:42,956
Indiana Pacer otherwise exported I think we
should keep all that we can decide if we
don't want to mount that or not right

330
00:58:45,339 --> 00:58:48,582
I mean we can keep it for mounting it

331
00:58:50,003 --> 00:58:55,297
I didn't install it on the North Coast it's
only on the control right here see

332
00:58:57,249 --> 00:59:11,816
and we could we actually turn off the
workers you say hey I don't need to fucking
now this I don't care I kind of want to do
that just to check and see if this is
working you know and if somebody leave it
here, in and out

333
00:59:12,074 --> 00:59:14,069
and I mean

334
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:25,603
not necessary for

335
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:30,429
storage class

336
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:40,747
my good for testing so if you want to make
sure everything works right you might still
want to mount it maybe we could do it by
hand but

337
00:59:41,922 --> 00:59:47,403
yeah you know I'm saying, I'm saying trying
to find Milan

338
00:59:47,403 --> 00:59:50,114
I want to see my end

339
00:59:50,114 --> 01:00:05,070
I still think we have our PC buying on the
client's right otherwise it can't do any
fast and storage class and fail I'm guessing
I don't know how much it broke or is it how
much of the NFS client as they use on the
client on the name Point notes

340
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:08,415
I know not so it's something we forgot

341
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:17,724
I'm finally done with that other file okay
so again we're not using these files right
away

342
01:00:18,797 --> 01:00:36,584
Avid it the reason we broke out this files
you want to be able to layer on the
different layers of configuration so we can
test things and Andre kind of go back to
that point in time kind of like you would do
if you were saving snapshots of remember
something outside

343
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:42,879
really okay there's there's not

344
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:54,723
there's just this one oh there it is

345
01:00:56,979 --> 01:00:58,420
or that come from

346
01:01:07,169 --> 01:01:13,010
yeah we are prpc by not everything that's
actually left over

347
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:23,265
I think that's left over in our in our in
our other one we had to fix that we got to
fix that

348
01:01:24,574 --> 01:01:26,510
and if you have to see mines

349
01:01:33,896 --> 01:01:43,456
enable rpcbind oh because it was a
combination right okay I get it I get it
yeah we combine the two files I screwed up
alright so

350
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:47,323
if you see my needs to be in everything

351
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:59,543
oh yeah that's too I saw an entertainment
Fan Fest installed

352
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:08,287
all right this is good it's nice and nice
and clean now that's what happens when you
combine config files so

353
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:11,449
a lot of fast got that

354
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:24,231
I think we are busy but I think it's his
fault with nfsu2 I think I believe it was it
was listed as an individual thing to install
it's not always thank you for that follow

355
01:02:25,684 --> 01:03:02,093
so should we have since Sunday and I have to
see mine and then maybe the firewall rules
and then we have the we have the control
test so this is the only one that gets out
of a server in the export Beer Fest even
though we disabled mountain by the remote
clients in this river runs on everything so
that's why we have a check for the names
that's also why we added hostnames to leave
her file so we can do that kind of
conditional provisioning and keep it in a
single script you know this IP addresses
lockdown based on

356
01:03:02,097 --> 01:03:41,513
the stuff that we did in bigger file has
been a considerable amount of time the other
day learning how to partition which is
unnecessary we debate about whether you
should even put a primary partition without
feeling the whole disk of the volume that
you never going to be purchasing any other
way we could have easily done this without
the one and an stb I just felt uncomfortable
doing that because I don't want to encourage
especially beginner is 2 to an hour format
and then too broad of ice is out of the bed
up for Tisha number at the end at 3 in
common and I didn't want to mess people up
with hey how are you

357
01:03:42,102 --> 01:03:45,387
welcome so

358
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:50,615
welcome welcome so so we've got

359
01:03:50,615 --> 01:03:56,718
got a lot of stuff going on here okay so I
feel like that is pretty solid

360
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:26,370
comedian stuff is all over the board but
we're going to have to come back that we're
going to do this by hand that's why we're
doing this in a way to capture what we do by
hand into our provisional script so that if
we are one of them, that line we can
actually use the same bigger file to
provision a full kubernetes cluster
including a full standing up of like the
swords class and get ready and all that he
wants everything we can actually do all of
that and the command line

361
01:04:26,373 --> 01:04:38,441
as far as I know I do and it has to happen
after the other provisioning so and there's
some like delays is going to be interesting
to see how well we can we can actually go
that easily. It is definitely my Nexus

362
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:45,788
and so yeah let's go back in and try that

363
01:04:45,984 --> 01:04:53,666
I see you're no JS app low so let's see

364
01:04:54,464 --> 01:05:04,891
I think I think we're going to go I'm going
to cancel this one here again and again
we're going to run dread

365
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:11,496
this vagrant file here I didn't ever get
hers over here

366
01:05:11,498 --> 01:05:21,912
here's the last Busan anything I'm doing
with regard to the booths will be written
there I'll ask your questions shall be
answered in my about Paige this is

367
01:05:20,932 --> 01:05:29,226
this is Papa West right now but I'd
recommend doing Linux Mint if you can I'm
just kind of married to this one right now

368
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:37,779
I think you and I are going to kiss so

369
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:42,309
there's nothing in base right now so we can
do that

370
01:05:44,408 --> 01:06:03,069
we could do NFS I really don't give a shit
about anifest right now cuz I want to get to
the qbdm installation so that's why I have
this in kind of a sectional way we probably
could do container team I I don't know
though I feel like

371
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:15,294
I feel like I need to go through the steps
of installing container to again even though
that is not technically a part of kubernetes
installing container d

372
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:23,544
it's is populist yep

373
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:30,232
and let's look at container date so

374
01:06:32,573 --> 01:07:03,120
it is if you're an atom and yes it is
absolutely is but if it was on that test it
wouldn't be on the test and I figure there's
nothing about setting up container to your
doctor c e or anything like that they would
ever be on a kubernetes certification it's
definitely require knowledge for an
infrastructure engineer who hands it over to
the community's person but I'm in Instagram
yeah I'm over there but I don't do a lot
over there very much so so let's see here
I'm going to do

375
01:07:03,237 --> 01:07:05,789
we don't need them update

376
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:14,273
we actually do need an update after
evacuation manager change so I can go ahead
and put that here

377
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:25,069
if it is Sunil Rana can cluster yeah I shall
try some Lenox jokes Lola

378
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:30,420
absolutely should we come install container
d

379
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:51,595
I can hear you can fig and he's a
configuration file and enable Community this
goes on everything we're going to do the
bridge stuff and Kennedy my probe to get
that going set for crisis me of mail this
six like container is and confirm for me LBG
this to me is is is

380
01:07:51,597 --> 01:08:06,014
this is kubernetes only configuration right
here yeah I figure Kris a deal I agree do
you think I should be in community or
something you probably have it be its own
thing

381
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:10,411
I feel like this is kubernetes related
information right here

382
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:15,140
this is something I can use for a new
modules

383
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:19,673
but this isn't but this says we put this in
a container d.com so

384
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:29,248
and what do we do there do you think this is
needed for container D or do you think that
we should put it in Michigan

385
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:35,809
our son is he on our yeah yes

386
01:08:35,809 --> 01:08:48,925
well that's that was the name that we chose
we can put any name there but I'm trying to
decide is whether this new mod Pro Bowl
relay and BR filter this is a part of
container t

387
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:54,369
but yeah yeah

388
01:08:55,995 --> 01:09:02,960
but then but we're putting mod loads opening
module Lowe's inside of retainer d

389
01:09:04,537 --> 01:09:08,527
you know I kind of feel like

390
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:12,739
I want to put them here

391
01:09:14,245 --> 01:09:16,637
I don't know

392
01:09:18,966 --> 01:09:22,776
at this moment overlay stuff

393
01:09:22,777 --> 01:09:28,943
took these things these iptables rules are
not model ivr filter so let's just take this
out

394
01:09:28,943 --> 01:09:36,558
but you have to do a system CDL reload you
think your new container D to the
coronavirus cough

395
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:44,521
yeah but this is what this is going in
modules load and this is going assistant
uchealth I'm saying

396
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:47,204
cell

397
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:53,382
and I only want to do one sister sissy to
system reset

398
01:09:58,116 --> 01:10:01,909
I mean

399
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:06,421
yeah

400
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:16,297
yeah I figured this is

401
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:26,058
It's really till this these things are
prerequisites for container T they are kind
of like bass things that need to be at it I
would think

402
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,183
and multiple things have requirements on
them you know

403
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:38,738
I wonder if that stuff goes into base system
config I don't know

404
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:52,531
I mean they're they're not they're only need
it back already is out so I don't know I
kind of maybe breaking detainer tea and
system use a bad idea

405
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:56,499
maybe we should keep them together

406
01:11:00,515 --> 01:11:04,183
call Monroe on ansible oh you do

407
01:11:16,236 --> 01:11:20,360
turn off my LEDs yeah

408
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:30,137
yeah I don't know

409
01:11:36,122 --> 01:11:43,143
installing, packages yeah I was going to put
that in like Bass

410
01:11:43,964 --> 01:11:45,582
all your base

411
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,987
yeah I I think it does volume base

412
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:11,417
I don't like that it's container do you do
you know

413
01:12:11,692 --> 01:12:16,285
because if we pull it out it's like it's
like if I go to read it it's like

414
01:12:17,678 --> 01:12:24,994
it doesn't matter if I'm trying to use this
to like get a handle on what's required I'm
going to be confused

415
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:34,974
because I'm going to be like well you know
this is required for container to do, but
it's actually required for a lot of other
things right

416
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:45,838
I don't need that how's it going wow thank
you

417
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:52,484
you see them put them in a tomatoes and if
this is kefir yeah

418
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:06,607
kubernetes we're going to actually combine
all this

419
01:13:08,946 --> 01:13:12,740
yeah I'm going to confirm you can find them
all

420
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:17,953
cacique manager

421
01:13:18,504 --> 01:13:24,146
Zillow swap is it going to be saying
Integrity run time is it covered Eddie's
thing

422
01:13:24,146 --> 01:13:28,224
say Mossy Lennox is not a pretty thing

423
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:40,233
disable the firewall is of Granny singing
this is going to be something and then do
that he's so I'm making a Command Decision

424
01:13:40,234 --> 01:13:46,474
the things going so we're just going to do

425
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:55,360
I'm going to change the kids Gates

426
01:13:59,193 --> 01:14:05,821
all right so Basin FS communities no

427
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:13,091
bass B base could be where we turn off SE
Linux and it could be where we afraid the
colonel

428
01:14:13,635 --> 01:14:19,021
so I want to leave it because we might we
might need it

429
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:23,558
yeah I mean we haven't got that far but

430
01:14:27,303 --> 01:14:33,372
this is kind of annoying me though because
it's going to do the full communion since no
I don't want that I just want to hear you
set up

431
01:14:33,919 --> 01:14:41,581
that's the reason I broke it out I wanted to
go all the way up to the point where I have
to install Cube ATM and I mean

432
01:14:42,494 --> 01:14:46,078
you know what I'm going back to my original

433
01:14:52,669 --> 01:15:15,621
if I want to be part of Base I don't want to
separate it up because it's a kubernetes is
the thing that requires that configuration
so if I put it in base it's like you know I
don't I see sequentially it makes sense but
I'm learning why is it doesn't make sense to
separate that out because I don't know what
needs it and I mean it's like

434
01:15:18,044 --> 01:15:20,373
and that's that's

435
01:15:21,874 --> 01:15:27,094
it's the same thing we could he ready to
even though you know this stuff makes sense

436
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:41,508
Overland by filter yeah I'm going to do you
need a sissy ctla-4 this as well

437
01:15:41,633 --> 01:15:51,489
after you do my provini Assisi jail right
now you don't ever mind that's this right so
this to me is kubernetes Ish stuff

438
01:15:51,729 --> 01:15:59,542
disable firewall communities yes alright I
feel better now so

439
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:09,556
I mean is it really containery that needs
the overtime BR NFL. I think it is right
modules are still communities

440
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:13,806
I know it's not cuz I just added the modules
load to here

441
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:23,390
why does it say okay to Overlay a net filter
I know these applied a lot of things right

442
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:30,222
the specific okay I think I think I have
enough I think I can agree with something
here

443
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:38,273
let's we need the stuff in the module
diagram okay so we can say

444
01:16:38,888 --> 01:16:44,602
I am getting on stupid here so

445
01:16:44,785 --> 01:16:48,853
colonel dependencies

446
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:53,697
so we can upgrade the colonel and then we
can apply these new thing this is Colonel
related right

447
01:16:54,981 --> 01:17:02,131
I am so sorry that God dammit

448
01:17:02,947 --> 01:17:04,344
god dammit

449
01:17:10,061 --> 01:17:15,968
yeah so what let's say

450
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:23,355
I don't know we can do modular we could say

451
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:49,658
what is our Auto it is anyway are they

452
01:17:53,271 --> 01:18:01,127
are you saying I don't need to do that to
disable and see

453
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:08,567
let's see if it blows up and it's not needed
I'm a v if I don't even fuck with my curl

454
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:21,262
test if these are in fact

455
01:18:27,691 --> 01:18:33,893
can I text with him oh keeping is going to
check for them in the mods

456
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:52,036
yeah that's what we had to Adams remember we
failed Okay so so that means it

457
01:18:54,787 --> 01:19:13,925
three-point I remember I remember that
actually know we have that are so I kind of
feel like we need to have it I'm sorry to
say this but I really feel like we need to
have that in the communities thing because
otherwise it's fine right. That's how I know
it belongs in Basin and then the container
he needs it

458
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:17,929
but I feel like that's a community's thing

459
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:31,799
is anything really fine disabling swap that
security requirement you know I'm saying so

460
01:19:43,834 --> 01:19:45,750
let's not continue run time

461
01:20:00,332 --> 01:20:01,647
right

462
01:20:23,876 --> 01:20:25,682
I feel better about this

463
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:32,751
now if we lived at off a little fell for his
from him

464
01:20:34,702 --> 01:20:43,557
yeah so backstabbing file I do want to get
all the way to continue to run without your
knees

465
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:51,443
so this this should be enough to guarantee
on it and then we should do some Trio set up
right

466
01:20:55,106 --> 01:21:09,456
is it isn't Chrissy Taylor greatest hits
that's in a container thing right no is that
you can hear anything I don't know I'm
pretty new to it I use this money last week

467
01:21:11,593 --> 01:21:17,341
it's already alright so let's add a note
here to to do that let's say

468
01:21:18,551 --> 01:21:21,448
disable firing communities

469
01:21:25,156 --> 01:21:27,083
cuz if you want yeah

470
01:21:35,782 --> 01:21:40,797
and there are two deer here for that alright
so

471
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:48,379
wait when we haven't seen each other still I
haven't got rid of that

472
01:21:53,282 --> 01:21:59,706
I'm just saying like I see Lenox like twice
I think we are yes

473
01:22:00,714 --> 01:22:06,362
oh nice thank you I'll go look at that when
we are. I don't know if I want to add it
right now cuz

474
01:22:06,612 --> 01:22:09,718
kind of out of scope

475
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:19,929
yum install cubelets

476
01:22:21,762 --> 01:22:23,914
hey there if it's

477
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,808
I'll put it here as a reference

478
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:45,850
all right so I feel good

479
01:22:46,240 --> 01:23:18,886
but that so when you go all the way to
container if we get if we go all the way
into getting container you then we can
simulate I am now handing the system off to
you communities team I have done my job and
I like simulating that separation because
that's a very real world scenario we have an
infrastructure team that's exactly what they
do when they tell us how should we they ask
that we modify our images of a blow when you
when you put on then we can do our own thing
and then you will put your stuff on there
and then you know they had it off

480
01:23:18,888 --> 01:23:25,892
so what's that wizard in your mind

481
01:23:26,253 --> 01:23:30,183
I probably mine

482
01:23:32,002 --> 01:23:38,232
I talked about a slack ding it hasn't been
one recently on my side

483
01:23:39,103 --> 01:23:44,771
Community steam here great passing

578
01:36:17,008 --> 01:36:20,206
why is it this vb.com

579
01:36:26,555 --> 01:36:27,885
yeah

580
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:38,086
I don't know everyone I don't know I do not
know it says

581
01:36:38,087 --> 01:36:45,174
the following this names are defined
multiple times in this configuration for the
game control

582
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:03,899
I don't I mean I feel like it had to be in
the provider and did it not

583
01:37:11,687 --> 01:37:13,664
let's try

584
01:37:23,165 --> 01:37:27,272
I could have swore the distaff had to be
inside of the VB thing

585
01:37:40,917 --> 01:37:45,311
Isaac associations yes

586
01:37:45,392 --> 01:38:00,290
I will and we don't do a lot of
customizations we talked about that is
something I want to tell everybody who's
gonna be going to the beginner boost for a
2022 on the first fucking day we're going to
install Linux and start doing something

587
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:02,037
we are not going to talk about

588
01:38:00,596 --> 01:38:25,281
talk about audited active cabinets and all
that stuff when I can do that I'm getting
rid of it all the time so you'll I mean
during am a kind of sessions like that you
can pick that up you can read about that you
can watch the videos about of the we're
going to jump right in and do the skill
stuff I still think learning to learn is the
primary school you need to learn but I would
rather we do it together and you just got to
pick it up by osmosis rather than sitting
there talking about it

589
01:38:25,284 --> 01:38:44,965
yeah just like everything else I'm going to
be doing a lot of projects that are going to
teach us the things that we're going to be
doing instead of talking about doing the
things which you know everybody know 70% of
learning is from doing it so that's a big
big we'll have time to do a lot of talk and
I tend to talk a lot so

590
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:47,821
you're trying to be Chappell

591
01:38:50,126 --> 01:38:59,708
yeah and it's that the stuff that's in it is
is going to change last night no kidding I
woke up and I was given a message from God

592
01:39:01,214 --> 01:39:07,609
and God said God said Alex Robb

593
01:39:09,385 --> 01:39:13,717
you need to start on the first day by
setting up a virtual machine in virtualbox

594
01:39:16,703 --> 01:39:26,612
that would be a compliment if it was Terry
Davis Davis Vibes I'm probably not I'm
definitely unhinged I'm just letting you
know I'm definitely unhinged you're not as
unhinged as him but

595
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:30,879
definitely an unhinged category

596
01:39:31,741 --> 01:40:32,339
I want to get my vacation April imagine
nearest well I'm hoping to make it worth
taking vacation for the reason is it goes
those three months is because those are the
exact 3 months that most people have school
off so that includes college and includes
you know high school and stuff like that the
beginner boost is designed to be not saying
that you're going but I've been counting
I've been counting the hours in the stuff we
have to cover and then like we've got to get
going right away we had to go in and do what
we need to see if you need to learn
virtualbox anyway I've decided to that
instead of Docker which is a change from
last year we still need to learn to give me
your regular doctor which is not going to
load it in the Boost and the reason I think
we need to learn to box in the boosted
because then you can walk around with all
your different Linux distros as fast as many
times as you want and that would be a kind
of a challenge for you to do that tried
installing on five different distros using
virtualbox and get really good sampling
different virtual box images so that you can
then make a decision about what you want to
put on your Hardware

597
01:40:32,347 --> 01:40:38,422
when we start the infrastructure boost to
the infrastructure boost in Canada location
looking at the calendar

598
01:40:38,613 --> 01:41:28,776
the the infrastructure engineering booze is
going to expect you to have you know to be
ready to run Linux on hardware and we have
18 weeks now because we combine with another
thing so we are going to cover now that I
have IRL streaming capability you know
through cameras are so we are going to be
it's always free yeah everything's always
free of course I really I really appreciate
it up sponsorships and the subs in putting
the word out there and stuff like that this
is the same stuff I was doing so I
personally I took a full-time job so that I
could financially support this effort and I
get a lot out of it personally I get it
money-wise not so much but I get a lot of
satisfaction out of doing it so when I can
stay with it I get really tired sometimes

599
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,090
cuz I'm old i b i I really do it

600
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:37,595
it is my goal is to provide some kickass
professional-grade

601
01:42:40,511 --> 01:42:45,311
good learn code save the world people that
is the mantra

602
01:42:47,054 --> 01:43:08,668
let me think that because we had this big I
bet this big fight with my agent and I don't
want to talk about it anywhere here I don't
want to talk about it here you just need to
know that I had this big massive drop
traumatic fight with Canadian because he
called me out on my own private stuff and
then proceeded to trash me everywhere and it
is

603
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:23,939
no he does not know no but we don't need to
compare look you can go on about his
business I just want to move on but I just
need to tell people if you want to help me
help counter the tide of hate against are
the Vicks rub

604
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:30,521
and and go out there and do something good
you know what the stuff is going to share it
pass it forward

605
01:43:30,803 --> 01:43:35,247
yeah we have no time to talk about that yeah

606
01:43:36,268 --> 01:43:41,987
internet cloud is bs anyway exactly if I
agree

607
01:43:42,991 --> 01:43:44,464
I agree

608
01:43:45,212 --> 01:44:02,111
so here we go. We've got we've got we're
almost ready I'm feeling very positive about
this I feel like this is actually going to
work

609
01:44:03,349 --> 01:44:10,210
Cloud I'm worried about as it is Lola so

610
01:44:13,437 --> 01:44:15,920
treating symlink

611
01:44:17,276 --> 01:44:21,472
cute little things there believe me

612
01:44:22,217 --> 01:44:32,213
it's fine it's it was not talked about it
since I committed I am an asshole I'm going
to right now I'm an ass-whole you know what
makes me an asshole

613
01:44:32,214 --> 01:44:40,469
I'mma tell you what makes me nuts all I
require you to meet your own potential

614
01:44:40,471 --> 01:44:42,789
I don't tear people down

615
01:44:42,790 --> 01:45:04,622
I require you to meet your own potential and
that makes me push you and say shit that I
mean in good faith the cause has been
causing snowflakes to smelt to melt so when
I say stuff like look at the fucking about
page or somebody asked me what time it is
which I used to rip people a new one Annika
I can say right now I have gotten much
better at that

616
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:07,947
I want to say I personally got better that

617
01:45:07,949 --> 01:45:15,206
how many times has somebody asked me what
time it was or what my time zone was and
it's right here

618
01:45:15,207 --> 01:45:46,956
it's right there on the screen people would
ask me what time it was I've been called OZO
you are a pretentious ass will just like
everybody said that somebody come in for 2
seconds asked me what time it was and and
what I stream about I said if you read my
about page and they went now I got time for
that I don't want that while you may want to
do that and they are out so you're just an
asshole you could just tell me like no your
the asshole cuz you didn't read my about
Paige realize what time it is right now I'm
people ask me what time it is I said oh it's
right here just have a look here

619
01:45:47,838 --> 01:45:52,720
you see how that's better than what I used
to say what I used to say

620
01:45:52,721 --> 01:46:03,582
I'm going to give you a test I'm going to
give you 30 seconds to evaluate everything
that's on the screen and see if you can find
the time and Mike you're such a dick might
have to be such a dick

621
01:46:04,064 --> 01:46:44,698
hopefully I have people tell me that they
like why are you such a dick like you just
tell me the time when to take me to two
seconds to tell me the time because I love
you that's why because I am preparing you to
not be a clueless moron who doesn't figure
out their own answer to their own questions
I don't want you to be the guy in the
cubicle or the girl in the cubicle who
knocks next door and says hey can you tell
me about it and then it said let me Google
that for you that's why I'm going to push
you and I'm going to be a dick I want to be
an asshole I'm going to require more of you
and but just know that I'm not I'm a like a
military person by do I'm not doing it
because I'm a man so I'm doing it for your
good

622
01:46:46,008 --> 01:46:56,063
I think sometimes it goes up to one minute
what the bed that the lag oh that's true
yeah that possibly could

623
01:46:56,063 --> 01:47:00,922
giving a bit but it still it doesn't you
know oh I see you for the kind like minutes

624
01:47:00,923 --> 01:47:08,264
but you can always look at the screen right
you can say oh wow look at that we're at 400
PN like literally had exactly

625
01:47:08,269 --> 01:47:11,085
credit is simplink

626
01:47:11,085 --> 01:47:20,082
oh my God it actually finished let's let's
move on and stop talking you sound like this
easier with my job and you don't like him
either to write or

627
01:47:24,476 --> 01:47:49,213
do you know the Google yeah if people you
say that to somebody and then some people
come back at you and they say you're such an
asshole and like why can't you just help me
I'm like the thing that bothers me about
that I have to I have to say my rent with my
nice fuzzy Gophers here go duck yourself my
favorite one go duck yourself when somebody
is an asshole

628
01:47:49,523 --> 01:47:52,486
ask yourself who is the greater asshole

629
01:47:53,045 --> 01:48:01,550
the person who barges into your space taking
your time which may be upwards of $100 an
hour

630
01:48:02,018 --> 01:48:08,117
to answer a question that you could have
taken 2 seconds to Google on your own but
you were too fucking lazy to look it up

631
01:48:08,727 --> 01:48:10,818
who's the greater asshole

632
01:48:11,275 --> 01:48:21,312
the person who doesn't do the search and
comes in and then calls you an asshole for
not answering your question or the person
who does he even let the fucking finger to
do their own research

633
01:48:21,483 --> 01:48:59,694
is it when when you have that reaction from
people like that suits you or me part of its
love and it's like hey we want to push you
to answer your questions become a better
person and the other part of it's like get
the fuck out of my face because you little
prick didn't even bother to do any of the
research on your own how dare you and that
comes off as an asshole are pedantic you
have you brace you're smarter than a minute
to come up with all kinds of reasons to make
you the enemy when in fact they were the one
who invaded your space wasted your time and
didn't even lift a finger to try to help
themselves and those people need to die

634
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:06,112
I don't mean literally die that way of
thinking needs to diet needs to cease to
exist

635
01:49:06,666 --> 01:49:14,043
you know and I that's that if that makes me
an asshole fine I'm a fucking asshole I'm an
unhinged pretentious

636
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:17,498
asshole if if you're going to call me that
great

637
01:49:17,613 --> 01:49:27,659

and I will guide your time is so very nice
actually is back in tucking time is valuable

all right give me a give me a plus use
camera flash shoes

639
01:49:36,132 --> 01:49:38,824

640
01:49:38,876 --> 01:49:46,754
it isn't so much I'm just doing that right
there are they did you just answer my
question will be done here we've been moving
on anything

641
01:49:47,036 --> 01:49:56,503
you wouldn't learn anything you would have
went away and understand the next person
wasted their time and then they're like for
the next for the next person in the whole
entire time you're actually hurting yourself

642
01:50:00,293 --> 01:50:05,131
Idaho time you're hurting yourself can I go
for free for me

and it sucks in all things worked well I'm
glad you mentioned that I have like bitten
my wife's head off when she walks in the
door in the middle of like some real
everybody knows I'm not a particular Dakota
Frankel tell you but I when I get really
really into some really hard shit with first
thing or something walks in and interrupt me
and I lose my train of thought people
understand and I T E especially if you're
over 50 maintaining your train of thought is
really critical this is why open floor plans
are moronic they're not scientific or
anything and IBM blocks everybody in their
own room with a big fucken picked or they
can lock why not so they can jack off in
there or something it's so that they can
actually get shit done and enter flowstate
Zone and have everybody the external and
then really really make huge breakthroughs
and they understand that and they always
have and it's one thing about IBM I really
admire

644
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:06,292
so young it doesn't work in your Castle is

645

699
01:58:28,127 --> 01:58:31,330
you think as Baseline for Mike's house
machines

700
01:58:33,855 --> 01:58:37,121
she feeling good I don't think Dad's to be
able to work anymore

701
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:48,133
shit we're going to start needing to do a
lot more of that second base myself I used
to run by Steel by Steel on it nobody here
remembers best deal anybody remember but
still

702
01:58:48,602 --> 01:58:51,977
I don't know what the modern equivalent best
deal is

703
01:58:56,534 --> 01:59:06,739
hurting your sisters is best deal Linux it's
a tool that uses the process of hardening a
Linux system of getting a choice with a
lockdown apparently it's still a thing how
old is this news

704
01:59:07,207 --> 01:59:14,196
2007 so it's not that old oh break is coming
up

705
01:59:14,495 --> 01:59:22,828
bushy South American do a do the competition
Judge Margaret yes it's happening big-time

706
01:59:22,829 --> 01:59:30,902
well we definitely did my amount Source like
all our internal stuff to like a whole team
in Brazil when I was there

707
01:59:31,029 --> 01:59:35,922
they fired like 12 people in there in like
18 from Brazil

708
01:59:35,922 --> 01:59:46,530
I was like one of three Americans left on
the company and the team cuz I was a good
deal no protein protein protein don't get
greedy

709
01:59:46,797 --> 01:59:50,512
take as much money as you're worth that's
fair

710
01:59:50,512 --> 02:00:20,295
but keep yourself a good deal because when
they ask comes to chop based on money they
won't care about skills all they care about
is where can we save the most money when it
when it when the tax comes like way from on
high and it says we're having a downsizing
measure they don't look at a seniority and
they don't look at Merritt they look at
dollars and if you are making less than your
peer and you feel bad because you're making
less than your. Probably deserve more than
that you'll still have a job

711
02:00:23,882 --> 02:00:28,795
1 developer as a senior oh God

712
02:00:28,795 --> 02:00:35,290
that's insane yeah I know that's it's really
hard it's hard to compete

713
02:00:35,734 --> 02:00:39,946
I think you'll keep your tools sharp people

714
02:00:42,189 --> 02:00:49,399
11 Cota cell phone it looks like best deal
still a thing

715
02:00:51,306 --> 02:00:53,773
it does

716
02:00:59,677 --> 02:01:03,963
I wonder if

717
02:01:13,064 --> 02:01:18,469
God dammit god dammit

718
02:01:21,391 --> 02:01:28,335
SommeSomme I need to

719
02:01:29,958 --> 02:01:32,134
can I can do that

720
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:39,113
is where I was just switching and trying to
break into a car now

721
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:51,513
if you have an oil gas oh yeah yeah I would
I would definitely do that cursed they sent
it first

722
02:01:51,856 --> 02:01:54,707
maybe the shelter second of Santa's Baseline

723
02:01:57,991 --> 02:02:14,696
Destiny you absolutely tack it gives you the
ability to control our own destiny
hands-down specifically server-side
Technologies like Cloud native oh my God you
can fucking write your ticket anywhere with
this stuff you really can curse Quest

724
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:16,486
first

725
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:25,931
we're on and and we haven't here to you on
here it which means there's a doctor thing
over here even though there's no darker

726
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:51,981
we will still continue with the doctor and I
feel very proud of that that's that's not an
easy task although the hardest part of that
is you still have to use the doctor the
doctor i c e repos but you don't you can
stop Integrity that I owe instead of doctors
to you because I know people that I work
with to get that to work and we did so that
makes me feel secure

727
02:02:52,906 --> 02:03:15,518
which is bad I know but getting container D
is like it's like super cool in the cloud
native World getting off of Docker is your
container engine is like really hip right
now if you can do that you're like you're
like cool if you if you still using Docker
see if you'd like

728
02:03:19,331 --> 02:03:25,470
oh my God how can we stop talking to this
guy

729
02:03:27,132 --> 02:03:36,156
I know that's horrible to say Creo is even
more him absolutely if you can get a career
was fucking already at work because it's so
fucking buggy

730
02:03:36,157 --> 02:03:42,773
what I understand back and stuff yeah well
learn the terminal and you'll be at already
ahead right

731
02:03:43,109 --> 02:04:06,824
a shop in Odessa delivering them yes. A
comeback in NBA mobile workstation with my
nieces and that's phenomenal that's
phenomenal if you're doing that and you're
very close eye on your way when skills are
good to have you should still have web
skills I'm not saying don't I just don't
have to focus on them cuz everyone else
those particular thing you'll learn with
Leon places like him

732
02:04:10,165 --> 02:04:14,773
as I said using your production since 1.16
seriously

733
02:04:18,582 --> 02:04:29,582
Kre-O is certainly hip now I have now I have
darker Envy I have container Envy I've
container engine Envy no God damn you

734
02:04:29,584 --> 02:04:37,403
you're going to make me do that aren't you
okay the goal of this particular thing is to
stimulate my work environment so

735
02:04:37,404 --> 02:04:44,651
oh yeah what you do shit you know we can do
a veggie

736
02:04:44,652 --> 02:05:22,642
just for fun cuz I know you're a sadist and
like to do this stuff for fun in my room
which one we can make a provisioning file
that uses Creo yeah we could make a good
day. That's that's provisioning file that's
it says you can tell her that we could do a
creole and then try to get the exact same
thing to work for 30 and then and then you
could really Bragg Dr Ste 103 container one
and a community one and we can do a creole
and you can stay so what's your internal I
don't know what you want to do them all I'll
try with all of them

737
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:48,842
I tried them all and in my environment I I
just I pull up my Xena doing I'm giving you
bragging rights I'm helping you get bragging
rights so that you can brag about it in a
job interview and also while you're drinking
beer with your buddies at the Lennox me to
or the communities conference I know how
long it's been since I've had my own car

738
02:05:48,846 --> 02:05:55,346
and finally recovering from the divorce and
running my own company and if

739
02:05:56,035 --> 02:06:01,676
my screen is the best thing about best the
best in terms of like compared best is a

740
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:13,858
best is a superlative inferring that it's
compared to something else it hanging out
isn't the best container orchestration
versus no matter something you have to like
follow that one up for me

741
02:06:18,089 --> 02:06:24,579
do to do do I need a bigger question is why
I converted is right why do you can register
jobs

742
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:33,328
just go look at the research research to go
research with the average kubernetes
certified administrator makes compared to
the average typescript developer

743
02:06:34,167 --> 02:06:44,298
go to that research and you'll see real fast
then goes then go search for like scarcity
and stuff like that who's posting the jobs
for infrastructure in devops engineers

744
02:06:44,618 --> 02:06:45,811
yeah

745
02:06:46,364 --> 02:06:56,080
as you speak if I don't find anything on
Pershing file directly can explain it not
even so which one Grill is c h i Dash

746
02:06:57,157 --> 02:07:03,491
I think we're done here I think I think we
actually use qbdm I think we're probably
ready to use comedian

747
02:07:05,461 --> 02:07:10,174
so I need to get there because I need to get
back to work here

748
02:07:12,563 --> 02:07:24,839
and you are such a pretty high-end I'm not
I'm not as as fond of doing anything cloud
or anything Cloud infrastructure related is
like crazy ass money

749
02:07:24,951 --> 02:07:32,341
it is I think I think the median salary for
an infrastructure engineer is 150k median

750
02:07:32,994 --> 02:07:40,647
and it need median salary of a web or
typescript developer is about 90 K 1890 k

751
02:07:40,648 --> 02:07:44,484
so and it is only takes another extra two
years or so to learn it

752
02:07:46,846 --> 02:07:48,954
so you know

753
02:07:50,667 --> 02:07:57,221
also I like it because it it would go in
pairs well with security and hacking and I
love to hack in my spare time

754
02:07:57,465 --> 02:08:06,742
when it's one of my great loves is hacking
so I'm not very good at it haven't in a long
time but but I really love hacking and
operation stuff goes really well with
hacking

755
02:08:07,057 --> 02:08:19,188
text but not so much actually that's not
true learning no JavaScript in and all of
that if you're going to be a pen tester and
attack websites which is has been, an attack
vector

756
02:08:19,401 --> 02:09:00,898
is a personal server Farms Alabama that
serves this stuff is still needed is still
needed to know it's absolutely that's all I
absolutely need it I think it's just the
people are migrating over to virtualization
and now they're moving one step further to
containerization and and Yummy Nummies join
the club 12 2013 this stuff all came out as
I know I don't need it round my own servers
and I realized how badly we actually do what
you do what you do for your first record for
Saturday and sat in and given a decent like
oh my God it did all of that for free for me
it's so magical phone like I normally I
don't like magic you know but in this thing
Casey like no I want the magic

757
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:06,340
sad day for Knotts contract crazy money yeah

758
02:09:06,354 --> 02:09:20,814
yeah 900 per day dude if if you especially
if you're our age and I'm this is an age of
something right so ages and works against
you and for you if you are an older veteran
engineer

759
02:09:21,699 --> 02:10:11,651
you don't let the internet scare you if if
you're an older veteran Lennox engineer Unix
engineer and you layer on cloud skills in
addition to the Decades of experience you
have the people that are my age most of the
people that are my age are making well over
three hundred thousand and they're they're
doing it for her either independently
wealthy millionaires they're doing high and
Contracting their ciccio's their Chief
Architects and and they are making well over
3000 so you know it's it just depends I'm
not making it by the way I'm making a lot
more now than I was offered in writing
250,000 so it's by somebody that I knew more
than I did

760
02:10:11,654 --> 02:10:40,926
good friend and I might who knows I mean I
might go back to that was the Consulting so
I could buy that was like flying around you
know Consulting with French makes and that
was specific I was like really into that I
was like oh my God I can actually be
replying in France every weekend and giving
a presentation that a runner cloud and say
yeah I didn't I didn't I turn it down turn
it down it was in the middle it was in the
middle of actually interviewed so there's a
quick story I actually interviewed with
their you know

761
02:10:40,697 --> 02:10:47,903
sitio and and I there talking to you during
the interview process

762
02:10:48,658 --> 02:10:54,275
the senior Executives that said hire this
guy in 02 the other guy

763
02:10:55,029 --> 02:11:02,537
it was very nice and I would frequently that
she would actually bring her presentations
to me

764
02:11:03,374 --> 02:11:38,396
because your kid was in my mentorship
community who's now in like a kick-ass
private school and she would bring her stuff
to me and I would run through it and I told
her you know what about get lab for CSE just
never heard of it before as if she would she
would bring me her presentations that she
would have me she would like he met them
just for fun and and then she would go
present to these big ass Juno sitio people
over in France French for French banks and
other places like that I don't think of an
issue dominated caught either

765
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:39,994
that's why I like I'm from

766
02:11:44,206 --> 02:11:56,624
every country you down now but I had a fun
day my wife and I were drinking like wine
out in the garden talking about it and like
oh my God you know and

767
02:11:57,182 --> 02:12:06,951
we were like really playing with it and I
undo the guy the guy told me that the reason
I know that I couldn't do it as a guy the
guy said to me he said

768
02:12:07,484 --> 02:12:11,011
I just want you to know that

769
02:12:11,012 --> 02:12:21,651
you know we don't we don't try to be the
Unicorn we we we try to understand what the
unicorns are doing and help other companies
reproduce with their doing

770
02:12:21,653 --> 02:13:16,422
and it's one of the very first things you
said in the interview is the CTO for a
company that you would definitely know that
I don't think he might have just been one of
the senior Executives I don't know that I
feel like it was at 2. But I don't know that
and he made it very clear at the very
beginning of the interview that this job was
about reproducing its successful
architectures I know it wasn't a fan company
but was a company whose total profit and
value is way more than a thank people keep
saying thank up is I'm like you know unless
you talk about Apple which is like crazy
overvalued there are a lot of companies out
there that are equally as valuable as Google
and others in terms of like total so this is
a consulting firm

771
02:13:16,427 --> 02:13:19,499
iMac I talked about who was

772
02:13:20,215 --> 02:13:31,348
as soon as they said he returned to the huge
ecosystem around communities yeah it did it
really did some people say that's all that
they wanted out of it is they want to know
if they can get a great job

773
02:13:31,349 --> 02:13:38,075
yeah so anyway he said he said that the goal
of this job

774
02:13:38,076 --> 02:13:45,431
what do understand what the unicorns were
doing and helping companies reproduce that
they were doing

775
02:13:46,144 --> 02:13:50,993
I remember telling my wife that is I don't I
don't want that I want to be the fucking
unicorn

776
02:13:50,994 --> 02:14:17,650
I want to chase unicorns only being a
fucking unicorn and it's true it's true and
then and then I realized that if I was going
to do that I would have to hand down I
wasn't ready I was I had 50 people depended
on me for their mentoring and learning and I
was not ready to throw that away at the time
at the time there was no Kobe everything and
we had health insurance we didn't have
health insurance but we were there was no
threat to our apartment and then

777
02:14:17,654 --> 02:14:59,543
how many things happened after that we got
we got kicked out of our apartment because
the guy undercover he wanted to sell it and
get the money out of it and he tells you if
you have it for five years he only gave us a
year that was the second time in a row
within three years of that happened to us by
the way now it's one of the main reasons I
took a corporate job is because because I
did I was sick and tired of the you know you
know relatively low paying corporate job
which is when I say relatively I mean
compared to when I probably could make that
making fun of fifty if that's what you're
wondering. Making that much but I said no I
said no and I it was nice to say know I'm
kind of glad I did it was the right thing to
do

778
02:14:59,548 --> 02:15:00,914
but dumb

779
02:15:00,914 --> 02:15:22,086
I'm by you know who knows we'll see we'll
see what happens I really really love the
company that I work for now that's it it's
it's it's very much a mom-and-pop company
it's a you know that they're doing great
things for the world is very unsexy but a
damned crazy crazy valuation and and money
and they're not afraid of technology and
they have one of the greatest machine

780
02:15:20,734 --> 02:15:58,354
one of the greatest machine-learning groups
in the world and and I really love it I
really love it right now so I'm not in a
real you know pressing that in a real
pressing position did look elsewhere as long
as they let me you know exploring and share
and stuff like that if it becomes to self
stifling and then stops you from do that
then I'll just move I can go anywhere at
this point and I feel better I think you'd
asked me the same thing last year I did not
feel this way I was a little bit panicked
because I needed to get a job that was going
to pay the bills after the whole Cove in
apartment thing

781
02:15:58,778 --> 02:16:04,515
custom set up a management tools change your
driver's job yeah Coronavirus

782
02:16:04,752 --> 02:16:34,155
Carolina Fan company and white box image of
particular space yeah what sort of things to
do in communities enforcer jr. right now I
because I have a lot of coding experience
I've kind of I'm kind of gravitated toward
building communities in ministration tools
so I've been auditing all of our internal
communities apps you know I was put in
charge of like a setting up to for the Hub
and installing that

783
02:16:34,157 --> 02:16:51,955
and so I tend to Ghana straddled the
developer thing I can say need it if he
needed application installed or they want to
explore creating some sort of system monitor
or something I sort of fit into that space
more more than others because I've got a lot
of coding experience for the persistent sore
things

784
02:16:52,183 --> 02:17:02,353
was that for companies that obsolete shit
that was collapsing yeah that's that does
that stresses you out I know what that's
like I know that's like

785
02:17:02,683 --> 02:17:22,194
yeah so that's why I kind of in a kubernetes
operations assistance tools developer and
get really really nice with my with my
that's what I made for IBM specific I even
wrote the network protocol for it

786
02:17:22,195 --> 02:17:36,646
and if I had to get really really you know
to the point of what my real cortex
specialty is that's it it's writing software
and application specifically for
infrastructure Engineering in administration

787
02:17:37,072 --> 02:17:41,772
I am not well we're just going through a
different way

788
02:17:42,156 --> 02:18:29,263
beginning morning. He's damaging Regional
actually that's funny you say that because I
am preparing that guy right now so February
12th through April 30th every Saturday from
noon to 5 I'll be covering at what I think
you need to do to get into communities and
container is having just learned about the
two years ago I had never even seen a doctor
file a written one and now I feel like I can
have a handle on what you need to learn I'm
not I'm not a veteran like lvg but I but I'm
a new beginner which means I've done a lot
of research about what I think you should
learn because I've had to go through it
right and hopefully I'll be certified by
then by July I'm not I'm not really keen on
certification but I thought it would you
know it was worth it in this case

789
02:18:29,269 --> 02:18:36,482
he presented everything our products at
Walmart they gave a Norman fence that's
already including armed guards everything

790
02:18:36,483 --> 02:18:56,604
if I can enter wow it's amazing you just
would not know there's so many companies
that you would just not even believe have
the level of of effect of the promise that
they do and people who limit themselves to
think companies really doing themselves a
disservice there in the world that is
service

791
02:18:56,606 --> 02:19:02,848
did you get it cut me like Exxon to pay half
a million you have 40 people salaries are
you

792
02:19:03,032 --> 02:19:43,718
yeah and not good for tomorrow if it yeah I
cannot deal with answering for other people
it's just not in my personality it's not in
my personality I've tried so hard that I was
a cruise director you know I've been a
president of mission presidents assistant
you know I've done stuff where I wasn't
responsible for other people's performance I
fucking hate it I hate I've been told that I
should consider it by people when I stepped
out and ring training and I'll be home and
they said you you're pretty good at this you
should do I'm like no I don't ever want to
answer for another person's performance and
rest of my life ever

793
02:19:45,952 --> 02:19:54,072
know your day all I know it can and that's
one of the reasons I want to go through this
again speaking of that

794
02:19:54,074 --> 02:20:01,655
on that note letting me stand up I have to
sit up for a while I'm going to stand up for
5 minutes and I'm going to go come back when
we come back we're going to do our Canadian
installation

795
02:20:01,061 --> 02:20:12,592
insulation and if everything goes well we
should have our keeping in insulation
finished and be able to create applications
within the next hour

796
02:20:13,258 --> 02:20:14,477
yeah

797
02:20:15,494 --> 02:20:34,791
it will back the couldn't what the reason
that you see me like even in an apartment
right now you know as we wait my wife does a
residency in Charlotte and then we are
considering moving into a nice Cottage I've
deliberately kept my needs very low because
I want to enjoy what I'm doing

798
02:20:35,444 --> 02:20:37,997
you know sue me

799
02:20:39,658 --> 02:20:55,265
he will say you should you make three times
that money becoming a consultant fly all
around and then responsible for other
people's appointments or anything I could
totally do that shit I know I could do it
but what I want to do it what would the
stress do to me you know what happened
opportunity to go camping that you know

800
02:20:56,111 --> 02:21:00,143
but having like boots-on-the-ground
techskills

801
02:21:00,359 --> 02:21:20,613
I get really uncomfortable when I don't have
boots on the ground techskills because that
is the one thing that ground you no matter
what if you have boots-on-the-ground
techskills other words you know how to shoot
you know how to make stuff you know how to
do is Miss Tracey not a code you can take
that anywhere

802
02:21:20,616 --> 02:21:34,122
if you're a project manager or if you're a
middle manager particular your job is
largely based on seniority I know that's
changed somewhat but you might learn a thing
or two

803
02:21:34,185 --> 02:21:44,222
is it believed involved me Community hours
ago God yeah I will never take a job that's
not remote isn't working remote for 25 years
why would I ever go into the office now
there's no reason

804
02:21:44,309 --> 02:21:46,422
Mike quit before I do

805
02:21:53,438 --> 02:21:57,115
oh thank you for signing up

806
02:21:57,246 --> 02:22:10,584
all right so and thank God for LPG and
people like LBJ in our community they are
way Superior to me for this kind of things
definitely good luck on the interview for a
bit 5

807
02:26:57,410 --> 02:27:01,690
yeah I am cuz I'm doing I'm doing a salad

808
02:29:19,781 --> 02:29:26,771
that means I'm donelet me know I need to go
again

809
02:29:27,932 --> 02:29:34,786
but it's also why I was not talking okay

810
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:43,202
let's do it ready to go is it legal to put a
mark in this actually

811
02:29:47,108 --> 02:29:51,509
there starts of cube ATM

812
02:29:55,105 --> 02:30:01,753
and it'll go pardon me

813
02:30:20,325 --> 02:30:25,125
all right your second check an email here

814
02:30:28,488 --> 02:30:36,302
shit when I do and you're going to hear
anybody say that right

815
02:30:41,734 --> 02:30:47,639
I've lost my teeth see Alice's

816
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:52,789
start a timer what time is it I don't have a
timer but once we could we could start timer

817
02:30:52,834 --> 02:31:04,349
turn down. Turn down and sell now we're not
installing a snap I refuse

818
02:31:04,508 --> 02:31:19,214
so first things first this is recap where
are we what do we do when we going to do
next we have three three virtual machines
control only one provision for the standard
companies actually we haven't done that yet

819
02:31:22,055 --> 02:31:24,308
yes no way to do that we actually

820
02:31:24,996 --> 02:31:35,435
we know we didn't install anything we just
there let's do that will do this disgrace FX
install the communities components

821
02:31:38,946 --> 02:31:44,698
and components and and game

822
02:31:46,751 --> 02:31:50,662
so we need so I can put us and prepare for
configuration is sup

823
02:31:54,466 --> 02:31:55,913
so

824
02:31:56,676 --> 02:32:26,043
so what are going to do well this is the
part I have to come remind my cell phone if
you have to install communities rights oh
and by the way what are we reading this from
so if you if you want to read this from the
the guy that's probably important to go do
that let's go let's go to the installing
Cube ATM from the communities documentation
right and then we can do what he using qpdm
to create a cluster so we need to do the
same

825
02:32:31,070 --> 02:32:39,255
so we need to install all the communities
components that's first and then we need to
in

826
02:32:39,655 --> 02:32:47,231
and then we need to install kubernetes
Ephraim given a.m.

827
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:54,983
this is the main thing that you're here for
him so we need to do

828
02:32:55,762 --> 02:33:01,093
create a small one if that's my amount and
we did that

829
02:33:04,389 --> 02:33:07,968
and and so on

830
02:33:12,127 --> 02:33:22,208
no I'm going to I'm going to guess right now
since I'm doing this kind of a test for
myself what I need to do next so I need to
install cute but we already so

831
02:33:22,209 --> 02:34:00,350
the main components let me restate this
every time the main components of a
kubernetes node R1 some sort of container
engine right strictly speaking this external
to give attendees and not listed in the
credits components on the documentation site
but that's needed you can have that first it
to you have to have a keyboard installed and
cute little cute includes to keep Roxie You
Keep Nash proxy something that runs the dam
itself but it's an important component it s
phone even though it's built in the queue
video I mean to Cuba and then you need he
would itself which is also in key would it's
a little confusing on the

832
02:34:01,613 --> 02:34:18,936
add banana dish into that you need two other
pieces of software you need to keep ATM and
take you back to the damn it said but it's
still an essential component is still within
an event independent as a component keep
Roxie is actually

833
02:34:19,032 --> 02:35:19,479
associated with the cube light even though
it's Run is it a man's head from something
else right when I got that bear bones things
what do you have to install in order to make
a machine into a node you have to install
container engine you have to install Cube
ATM on each of them I used to think you
didn't have to do that that you just need to
keep it on the control plane you do not have
to have qbdm on the workers as well in order
to join us you have to have given him
everywhere and then you have to have CDL if
you want to be able to do testing and stuff
and I keep CDL is the a client for a
controller for talking to the community is
there anyway even though technically you
know you need that on there it is not
required required I don't think but it is a
thing to install and the Q but Mickey what
is the main thing that has to be installed
so there's going to be three packages were
going to install from the community site

834
02:35:19,487 --> 02:35:37,521
security M cubed and and keeps eating them
so how do we do that when we have to go if
we go to the documentation we know they were
going to have to add o and Trinity says to
disable the swap so

835
02:35:38,541 --> 02:35:47,211
yeah we got to disable swap so it's you that
we're going to do this with the control
plane first actually listen to all of them
shall we

836
02:35:47,728 --> 02:35:49,704
yeah let's do that

837
02:35:54,373 --> 02:36:00,504
so big rent control SSH control

838
02:36:01,226 --> 02:36:05,923
and what are you doing we need to install

839
02:36:08,786 --> 02:36:16,688
Millenia turn to swap off swap off there is
a to do is swap off command Sudoku

840
02:36:17,025 --> 02:36:21,764
the swap have off dash

841
02:36:22,008 --> 02:36:28,796
I'm trying to do this by to test my memory I
guess that's alright

842
02:36:33,482 --> 02:36:35,485
hey how's it going

843
02:36:38,572 --> 02:36:41,842
swampfox Bakersfield Oasis

844
02:36:42,509 --> 02:36:49,376
Rock spaces Natural Area a

845
02:36:52,268 --> 02:36:59,113
yeah it's enabled a rate is

846
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:08,624
what is it now Melissa Levin

847
02:37:08,723 --> 02:37:14,524
figuring SSH into or like node one

848
02:37:15,246 --> 02:37:18,247
R2

849
02:37:21,245 --> 02:37:27,765
car accidents to miss you dash top

850
02:37:27,765 --> 02:37:34,866
yes he swap is on what's another way to go
swap LS

851
02:37:40,659 --> 02:37:46,434
free as well right memory box size

852
02:37:48,100 --> 02:37:56,090
and that's a sticks that are installed at
school I think I knew that free girl free

853
02:37:56,090 --> 02:38:01,680
yes I have swap and it's a swap is off

854
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:09,075
so swap off Ashley free

855
02:38:09,075 --> 02:38:13,873
so again now we can also

856
02:38:13,874 --> 02:38:22,197
that's we're doing this we can take note of
these things and go back and check them

857
02:38:22,198 --> 02:38:28,186
need to come in at this time let's do that
let's do this one here

858
02:38:28,487 --> 02:38:32,213
I got a cessation 02

859
02:38:34,258 --> 02:38:41,568
CVS in dash after I say I like the
repetition that's helping me to remember
it's so free

860
02:38:40,973 --> 02:38:46,646
free yeah it's ef-s tab where's the swap

861
02:38:48,849 --> 02:38:50,733
swamp nun

862
02:38:53,531 --> 02:38:58,487
and says if his mind contains the word Swap
come in and out

863
02:39:03,221 --> 02:39:08,999
and the sexy try this line show me what it
does so

864
02:39:10,632 --> 02:39:12,386
and actually run it

865
02:39:14,006 --> 02:39:19,814
and you'll see that it works it's using
reacts matches to replacement dash I has any
place that it

866
02:39:20,168 --> 02:39:25,582
and you'll see that FS tab Iowa swap is
coming out now

867
02:39:25,885 --> 02:39:33,051
right so that's all that's doing see what I
should have anyway

868
02:39:34,544 --> 02:39:36,867
yeah I guess I could

869
02:39:39,434 --> 02:39:46,702
seriously dashes but I've been doing it for
decades so yeah

870
02:39:49,501 --> 02:39:56,897
and so all we did is coming out this line
that turns it off

871
02:39:58,211 --> 02:40:02,645
so yeah I'm doing all these steps by hand
just as just as kind of a

872
02:40:02,861 --> 02:40:07,026
practical matter you don't want to mess up
FS have obviously

873
02:40:10,484 --> 02:40:14,365
all right so what else you knew we needed to
see an iPod 7 out

874
02:40:14,366 --> 02:40:27,638
we don't know that this stuff is essential
so I think we actually try to do without
know we I know we did we skip this and we
got burned by it so you can't skip this

875
02:40:28,735 --> 02:40:49,602
and this required for this an iPod
networking except new pots can't talk to
each other if you don't do it you can get
you to bring the readies up with give me the
am enjoying everything but then the pots
can't talk to each other so subtly useless
and I actually did all that so I already hit
that problem I almost kind of want to bring
it up without it and then we can come back
and add it

876
02:40:50,337 --> 02:41:14,772
later maybe let's try that just so you guys
can see so let's actually try to bring
kubernetes up without the scene iPod stuff
okay should be speaking I think this stuff
could probably come after your 21 days
installation what do you think we could try
it this right we're going to skip this part
right

877
02:41:17,443 --> 02:41:19,087
yeah

878
02:41:21,222 --> 02:41:25,702
I guess we do need overlay the netfilter
stuff we need that's for the senior high

879
02:41:27,613 --> 02:41:46,302
yeah I know I look so so so I'm going to see
if I how much of Covidien I can do without
that and we'll come back and added if we can
so this stuff this is how you add
communities repo to yum

880
02:41:46,304 --> 02:41:49,498
I think there's a better command for this
kind of thing

881
02:41:49,499 --> 02:41:58,607
but this is straight out of the
documentation so there's no getting around
this when fortunately

882
02:41:58,689 --> 02:42:01,436
so yeah we're going to have to have

883
02:42:01,438 --> 02:42:35,455
this is when you would have to cut and paste
there's no memorizing it it's a tunnel file
looks like a community's name is communities
may crl name was you cuz you check repo
check gpg keys and exclude and the reason
they have the excludes is so that they
doesn't get out of me updated so it doesn't
get you out of sync with your base
communities and saw on the server what you
want be what you'd stop your stuff from
working so and this is not one that we can
easily do

884
02:42:38,494 --> 02:42:43,550
I'm going to yank this and then I'm going to
run it remote

885
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:50,375
a vagrant is to Sage actually I think I can
do vagrant SUV

886
02:42:50,597 --> 02:43:13,336
maygrant this is why I do my own buffering
by the way as CPA temp uses an independent
buffer that ended on div cuz sometimes I
like to use my buffers for other things
besides with Cindy I am cuz eunuchs and I
may want to copy this to

887
02:43:15,845 --> 02:43:23,111
look up control Temple off attempt

888
02:43:24,570 --> 02:43:31,047
I think I did it wrong is it file

889
02:43:36,233 --> 02:43:43,570
deploys code in the Survivor to the
configure destination provision Vigor
machine

890
02:43:44,535 --> 02:43:51,820
I need your new Vapor cuz I don't know I
thought I thought there was an SUV I guess
not

891
02:43:52,709 --> 02:43:59,314
I think it's just file here's the sitch
config and put it in this is your big

892
02:44:01,554 --> 02:44:05,277
yeah that's cool I didn't know that

893
02:44:05,816 --> 02:44:09,660
I didn't know about that but add that to my
learning list

894
02:44:16,097 --> 02:44:20,288
I am just curious to see if I can do it
there's another bigger, that doesn't require
then

895
02:44:22,977 --> 02:44:25,479
use of vagrants

896
02:44:38,437 --> 02:44:42,583
since I'm using SSH it's just easier

897
02:44:58,765 --> 02:45:08,348
I guess that's good that mean I kind of
wanted anyway because that would the skills
I be putting into my brain will be what I
would do in real life right

898
02:45:08,372 --> 02:45:11,353
I feel like I want to do that no matter what

899
02:45:19,636 --> 02:45:25,832
it's always going to be the same IP address
right no because it had me to public aid

900
02:45:27,014 --> 02:45:32,943
give me the public and private key vagrant

901
02:45:33,247 --> 02:45:35,676
SSH config

902
02:45:40,555 --> 02:45:42,282
is bugging

903
02:45:47,324 --> 02:45:50,685
easiest way to copy a file

904
02:45:50,821 --> 02:45:55,904
oh that's the one I saw that's why I thought
it existed I saw that the other day

905
02:45:57,525 --> 02:46:03,136
can you file hell is awesome

906
02:46:04,684 --> 02:46:13,094
could a strong community that vagrant that
reminds me it's not bigger than my in my my
file here

907
02:46:16,394 --> 02:46:22,570
. Getting our I don't need this video in
there in 1 L

908
02:46:23,565 --> 02:46:30,286
all right so so what we're going to do I
mean

909
02:46:32,646 --> 02:46:41,116
I think I want to get used to the I know you
can push a single file but just don't file
but I mean I've seen him into it with
England

910
02:46:41,139 --> 02:46:45,637
but I kind of want it I think I I think I
want to do this to say something

911
02:46:45,638 --> 02:46:49,685
plus that also helps people understand how
did USA trade

912
02:46:51,148 --> 02:46:57,452
I don't use a specific for anything so this
will be interesting

913
02:46:57,453 --> 02:47:19,353
now because I look at here I'm going to
pause here this is this should be an example
of when VI kicks ass and eunuchs philosophy
because I should be able to do this I should
be able to go to SSH config and bang bang to
get the filter command and type vagrant SSH.
Config and have it put it in here

914
02:47:19,355 --> 02:47:32,093
yep then we go so it just ran the whole
thing and right from the eye and it plug it
right into their that's because I use the
filter commands VI and that's how I'm
fucking plugin

915
02:47:33,747 --> 02:47:40,687
so that's kind of cool now with that there I
should be able to SSH to control

916
02:47:40,689 --> 02:47:47,199
and I haven't and I like an SUV and
everything that is really really cool

917
02:47:48,191 --> 02:47:57,473
that didn't take me even a few seconds to do
it the fastest way to do this

918
02:47:57,644 --> 02:48:00,896
to open up can I want

919
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:12,324
and use the filter command

920
02:48:14,312 --> 02:48:21,026
to replace a line with the output of

921
02:48:21,725 --> 02:48:30,571
vagrants could fig and then clean up the
comments

922
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:41,449
I could do to go see the devil him

923
02:48:42,668 --> 02:48:48,374
you have to rekey yeah depending on

924
02:48:49,024 --> 02:48:55,487
your changes to your configuration you might
have to

925
02:48:57,080 --> 02:49:03,694
rerun this after running on vagrants of

926
02:49:06,247 --> 02:49:11,932
or vision yep

927
02:49:14,297 --> 02:49:18,372
alright so analog in there

928
02:49:18,730 --> 02:49:26,428
I think it is raining very very two locks
yes waiting for Sean for employees code in
this environment to a configure destination

929
02:49:27,404 --> 02:49:32,695
I think Bush washer put a follow-up there
has it gone run Riddim

930
02:49:33,107 --> 02:49:36,570
and let's do that so

931
02:49:39,736 --> 02:49:45,922
so now we can actually just mean a m u s e p
10 buff up their hair

932
02:49:47,848 --> 02:50:02,076
it's true the matter is you don't even have
to be that we could just run it so give me
there it is right there's a buff I'll let me
know you really that we just left the
station I see that it's even better

933
02:50:03,872 --> 02:50:10,404
so every does SSH the file cuz I mean look
what's in it

934
02:50:11,843 --> 02:50:15,913
it gets it to the end of two communities

935
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:25,171
yep let's give it a shot we should be able
to just ssage that file

936
02:50:29,033 --> 02:50:31,162
I don't know we're going to try

937
02:50:34,832 --> 02:50:41,691
I think I'm going to dash it would work I
meant I mean

938
02:50:43,635 --> 02:50:50,634
yeah it is that we copied over trying to
think of how we could get that all that such
a run

939
02:50:53,927 --> 02:50:55,598
I tried something

940
02:51:09,603 --> 02:51:12,328
yeah it's a single command so

941
02:51:13,048 --> 02:51:25,478
I don't know yeah we just going to do that I
would never can it like that though you bad
person how dare you can't like that you know
better than that I know you do

942
02:51:28,583 --> 02:51:34,641
drunk Mash yeah

943
02:51:38,111 --> 02:51:43,889
there we go I need that worked

944
02:51:44,424 --> 02:51:48,214
so so

945
02:51:49,783 --> 02:51:57,439
if that works then the stuff should be at
the bottom of this

946
02:51:57,504 --> 02:52:02,560
no I should be at the bottom of this

947
02:52:03,574 --> 02:52:05,991
imma try to be right at 2 I do remember

948
02:52:09,785 --> 02:52:15,957
this PA

949
02:52:16,068 --> 02:52:21,189
as early as yep there it is so thank you man
worked

950
02:52:21,189 --> 02:52:41,488
it's actually going to that command hell you
do it like this if you're safe or before i n
control node one no to this is just fun to
do as a stage control temp done and that
will do it for every single system just to
check it though

951
02:52:40,821 --> 02:52:45,523
to check it though going to do an echo on
the command instead of the actual command

952
02:52:46,689 --> 02:52:49,251
alright so

953
02:52:50,592 --> 02:52:58,048
I see that and that should put it in all
three yet leaving out

954
02:53:03,436 --> 02:53:07,021
yeah yeah I guess you could even do that
yeah I take her soon

955
02:53:07,627 --> 02:53:12,514
yeah I know that's why I was upset so I was
afraid of it's only a single command so I
think we can do

956
02:53:14,650 --> 02:53:21,659
and an assassin station control and yet I'd
see what was it revealed e

957
02:53:24,029 --> 02:53:26,730
God damn it I can't remember

958
02:53:30,496 --> 02:53:32,094
temp off

959
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:39,402
Emory post that damn I got to get I got to
remember this shit and see him repos

960
02:53:40,884 --> 02:53:42,924
kubernetes styrofoam

961
02:53:43,195 --> 02:53:55,973
there we go all right so they all have it if
I really wanted to I could do the same
command to take at it right I could just

962
02:53:56,533 --> 02:54:03,096
as a sage cat this

963
02:54:04,370 --> 02:54:07,937
and no show us all the app so they're all
there

964
02:54:09,627 --> 02:54:13,670
you got SSH is your best friend in this kind
of thing is like really nice right

965
02:54:13,779 --> 02:54:26,216
I don't mean that. I guess there's there's
our notes we did all that work remotely so
we don't even really need to be logged in
it's nice being logged in Powershell no

966
02:54:26,472 --> 02:54:34,093
I don't use pssh what what is pssh

967
02:54:37,894 --> 02:54:43,491
perilous is 4 G oh I've heard about this

968
02:54:43,495 --> 02:54:47,105
I've heard that this I never have looked
into it no

969
02:54:47,567 --> 02:55:05,568
yeah it does the same command a lot across
multiple things that people can do this they
do this wooden and T-Maxx to there's a way
to open up key marks windows on all three
systems that everything you type goes into
all the systems and I haven't figured how to
do that either that's one of the cool too
much things I've never learned

970
02:55:05,569 --> 02:55:15,941
you can open a like how's it going so you
going to have you can open up a 2X window
like this and every single winner will get
the same keystrokes

971
02:55:16,189 --> 02:55:18,440
and I don't know how to do it

972
02:55:18,441 --> 02:55:29,324
I kind of want to know though I saw somebody
doing that when they were doing committee
set up actually so I'm going to take a
rabbit hole

973
02:55:29,325 --> 02:55:39,522
Yeah it's cool so how how can I
simultaneously time

974
02:55:39,904 --> 02:55:43,346
into is it control V

975
02:55:46,344 --> 02:55:49,256
that may be a faster way to find it

976
02:55:51,914 --> 02:55:57,832
Crystal Pace buffers whenever it's a
specific command

977
02:55:58,024 --> 02:56:12,764
tracking laritate through pain suspense like
this loud blancpain it's kind of like you
know how you can you can turn your cursor on
for multiple men have multiple characters in
v-bucks I mean it and it's kind of like that

978
02:56:26,014 --> 02:56:32,718
yeah is that it you found it

979
02:56:32,718 --> 02:56:37,575
synchronize pains on is it really that easy

980
02:56:37,576 --> 02:56:42,419
is it that easy oh my God you guys are the
best y'all are the best

981
02:56:43,089 --> 02:56:50,959
oh that is so cool is that create sync

982
02:56:51,701 --> 02:56:56,597
synchronize team Ox pains

983
02:56:59,855 --> 02:57:07,339
on clear history yeah well

984
02:57:08,238 --> 02:57:12,705
so what we got here we've got

985
02:57:12,707 --> 02:57:20,553
conference link address again these notes
are all available for anybody else he wants
to come fall along or you just joining

986
02:57:20,553 --> 02:57:28,329
this disease has herforecast for here yeah
this this needs to be I got permanent
addition to my team which file

987
02:57:28,932 --> 02:57:35,183
I saw a kubernetes admin doing it they had
like their nose and everything

988
02:57:35,567 --> 02:57:45,115
anything that was cool as it they could they
could copy back and forth while they had
like three workers typing the same joint
command at the same time

989
02:57:46,112 --> 02:57:52,306
yeah it was super cool and I was like woah

990
02:57:57,168 --> 02:58:02,362
and probably are from yeah I mean it's it
sounds a little too good to be true

991
02:58:04,774 --> 02:58:07,613
what I think it's worth looking at you know

992
02:58:09,523 --> 02:58:15,918
so Serie set set synchronize pains on right

993
02:58:19,512 --> 02:58:35,198
I don't think I saw that I took over my my
see my Creator it actually makes two pains
every time so that its base is it out
probably two months it's just supposed to
fucking amazing people complain and people
fight out their best when a manager like
okay that's nice

994
02:58:36,270 --> 02:58:41,750
it's just so crazy awesome Panera Bread

995
02:58:44,524 --> 02:58:51,142
her any email patterns on a field yeah
that's right it's so

996
02:58:52,501 --> 02:58:57,903
set w you guys being stabbed on

997
02:59:01,319 --> 02:59:07,849

completion that's not that bad

998
02:59:07,849 --> 02:59:11,837
that is not that bad with have completion

999
02:59:14,401 --> 02:59:21,022
yeah that is fucking awesome oh I can't even
raining over here my blancpain

no such thing on the file

1003
02:59:49,890 --> 02:59:55,325
clear all three of them LS free

1004
03:00:04,019 --> 03:00:12,157
oh my God it goes so well with the vagrant
work we've been doing cuz the vagrant
usually brings like one two or three of
machines up you know

1005
03:00:12,157 --> 03:00:19,494
that is so awesome oh I got why is anybody
using anything besides he likes I mean

1008
03:00:34,287 --> 03:00:41,840
God are in dash r f yeah so

1009
03:00:42,379 --> 03:00:48,118
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Ella CPU oh God

1010
03:00:49,678 --> 03:00:54,951
how do you just get the kind of CPUs we did
this once and I can't hear what it was

1011
03:00:55,421 --> 03:01:01,585
LS CPU h

1012
03:01:01,585 --> 03:01:04,330
how do I just get the one

1013
03:01:06,549 --> 03:01:12,710
hey looking for it said that she'll be here
in both of them on all of them

1014
03:01:13,154 --> 03:01:16,158

1015
03:01:18,268 --> 03:01:23,282
nrz few nope

all the stuff we were just doing though
right which one do we want

1018
03:01:38,210 --> 03:01:43,834
we want Sheba Coors right so

1019
03:01:43,834 --> 03:01:49,677
actually scrap cores out of this

1020
03:01:50,291 --> 03:01:56,284
there you go there you go

1021
03:01:57,024 --> 03:02:04,861
a a i l s u b l s if you have to dig through
itand I'm trying to figure out a way to not
to do that

1022
03:02:08,826 --> 03:02:14,647
oh God Hennessey architecture information

1023
03:02:15,781 --> 03:02:22,861
there's an argument for that just gives you
the number and I don't know what it is I can
remember I guess where there is there's one

1024
03:02:23,586 --> 03:02:28,759
online offline extended help

1025
03:02:30,642 --> 03:02:39,191
let's just make a list of arguments is equal
sign blank are examples of equal CPU or
extended see if you know

1026
03:02:41,092 --> 03:02:47,130
and Spencer in Henryville formation space if
you

1027
03:02:49,595 --> 03:02:52,125
Nash is it in Prague

1028

1030
03:03:12,204 --> 03:03:18,093
when you 2

1031
03:03:19,007 --> 03:03:23,397
number of processors only

1032
03:03:25,325 --> 03:03:27,029
is it threads

1033
03:03:35,127 --> 03:03:42,045
what would I want to say here Coors

1034
03:03:47,356 --> 03:03:54,472
how can we know that hair yeah mine says 8 I
have a course

1035
03:03:55,499 --> 03:04:03,223
right actually no I have 4 CPU for quarters
in 8 whatever

1036
03:04:03,919 --> 03:04:05,757
with the other names

1037
03:04:07,713 --> 03:04:13,522
see what I'm doing I'm doing some today's
Administration stuff

1038
03:04:14,217 --> 03:04:18,998
so is there a number of course

1039
03:04:29,179 --> 03:04:33,986
processing units processing units available
going to process

1040
03:04:34,276 --> 03:04:39,699
what's the number online processors I like
that

1041
03:04:40,628 --> 03:04:43,821
shows the number of

1042
03:04:52,442 --> 03:04:55,594
wish maybe that's the number of cores

1043
03:05:05,553 --> 03:05:09,247
Camp Rock but and Truck Yeah

1044
03:05:12,490 --> 03:05:15,758
save some groups as pretty much it

1045
03:05:17,114 --> 03:05:21,525
yep and Crockett today I learn and practice
a thing

1046
03:05:22,409 --> 03:05:26,396
and now we can do it on all the machines at
the same time

1047
03:05:28,978 --> 03:05:43,652
oh my god there will be this will be known
as as the therapy the time before I learned
about multi-pane synchronization and the day
after the time after it'll it'll be a moment
in time

1048
03:05:45,014 --> 03:05:52,820
that is so cool I ate a gusher

1049
03:05:57,194 --> 03:06:04,234
Pro tips tips teemix when X

1050
03:06:08,541 --> 03:06:15,354
I don't know develops its kind of democracy

haha

1053
03:06:35,386 --> 03:06:42,169
all right now. Onward and upward all right
so we got our products that we've got our

1054
03:06:40,743 --> 03:06:45,408
Roxette we've got our communities thing set
up

1055
03:06:45,852 --> 03:06:53,672
keyboard shortcut for it yes we do yeah I
don't I don't know if I need one

1056
03:06:54,792 --> 03:06:57,784
is that is my own thing

1057
03:07:00,304 --> 03:07:06,769
set my own Knowledge Management tool it's
not nearly finished but it it works

1058
03:07:11,077 --> 03:07:19,688
yeah it just sent a tweet out to and it did
that by the way so

1059
03:07:19,993 --> 03:07:28,833
get cough but in Brookshire is a siskonpeti
I did not know this did not know this y'all
are real smart

1060
03:07:30,570 --> 03:07:39,162
this is I mean this is why I do this I get
to hear this cool thank you I just alright
what's that well let's do this let's do

1061
03:07:39,678 --> 03:07:46,523
yum that's why I update because everything
is got to be updated cuz we just had a
kubernetes right

1062
03:07:46,697 --> 03:07:52,907
so we're going to add that in all three
systems at the same time

1063
03:07:58,079 --> 03:08:00,940
I got count number processes only

1064
03:08:01,644 --> 03:08:06,619
as long as it has is his confia going to go
and

1065
03:08:06,970 --> 03:08:10,751
this is so much fun this is why I became an
admin

1066
03:08:15,640 --> 03:08:25,551
I mean this is the kind of thing if I had to
do it like one of the other I've been
waiting forever right I have to log in and
everything is just had like three open

1067
03:08:27,681 --> 03:08:32,933
it's like it's like a race who's going to
win do you think the dual core is going to
win

1068
03:08:32,933 --> 03:08:47,845
is it to frock is a Tupac control going to
win and work against the workers or is it
worker they are in that final stretch and
knowed one is catching up on no to a new
2902

1069
03:08:52,415 --> 03:08:56,864
yeah I went and then we can actually wait we
can have top in another window

1070
03:08:57,548 --> 03:09:00,951
what is stop Thursday sub

1071
03:09:01,050 --> 03:09:06,447
a stop is going at it it's a hundred percent
see if you do as a nation

1072
03:09:06,463 --> 03:09:14,415
God damn look at all those things my fan is
on it's okay just came up

1073
03:09:16,203 --> 03:09:22,290
do do do yeah

1074
03:09:23,291 --> 03:09:26,122
a lot of I owe ya hear that

1075
03:09:27,122 --> 03:09:34,320
I mean this isn't a really heavy machine so
this is doing pretty damn well for giving
hell you know

1076
03:09:36,004 --> 03:09:42,448
it's definitely taxing the the system you
know

1077
03:09:43,728 --> 03:09:46,075
because

1078
03:09:46,159 --> 03:09:58,951
it's all on the same machine it's all in the
same order when we're getting we're getting
a chance to see what I do hate each other

1079
03:09:58,951 --> 03:10:06,798
that was pretty close another done I'll
leave that up just was there

1080
03:10:09,778 --> 03:10:15,511
it is still good over here to LA why does

1081
03:10:15,602 --> 03:10:24,114
it doesn't get to install that shit so young

1082
03:10:24,114 --> 03:10:30,854
that's why install cubelet

1083
03:10:30,854 --> 03:10:37,397
Cube CDL and Cube ATM all at one time

1084
03:10:37,398 --> 03:10:43,531
ready let the race begin oh shit

1085
03:10:43,674 --> 03:10:46,700
oh you know why

1086
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:57,268
we have to we have to we have to force the
cave people out there right now or asking
why did you exclude the thing that you're
just about to add

1087
03:10:57,290 --> 03:11:22,168
and the reason we're doing that is because
we never ever ever 1 a.m. update to update
those packages because they will put them
out of sync with the server and really fuck
is up that's why they're in the exclude list
so in order to do that you have to use an
extra command with with yum because of
warnings and it'll tell you if if you get
more than two levels out of

1088
03:11:20,695 --> 03:11:47,460
two levels out of date out of sync all of
the components will stop working your keeps
each other because they can't it says nope
I'm sorry you're too far away from the
version and it will separate you two you
never want some dinner and me to ask them if
they batshit but then you don't want to eat
with an update or something so you have them
to exclude least that's not particularly
obvious so it's worth missing because I know
that there is way to do this

1089
03:11:47,707 --> 03:11:54,628
I know that there is there is a way there is
disabled excludes for

1090
03:11:55,470 --> 03:12:03,205
kubernetes the curb as you're the silly
young thing that I'm not particularly
acquainted with so I'm going to put that on
there

1091
03:12:03,452 --> 03:12:04,712
add

1092
03:12:06,213 --> 03:12:28,797
Patty up doing you want to eat you had this
this line right here yeah but disable
exclusive kubernetes and your Junior had one
who doesn't know any better is going to not
nagging like I can't I have to be excluded
can you tell me how to do not exclude it and
if we need to save up because X and Y this
saves you from from them so let's try that

1093
03:12:31,673 --> 03:12:34,150
I can raise is already up and running

1094
03:12:36,606 --> 03:12:41,237
we still want it on even after its up and
running because if you

1095
03:12:41,237 --> 03:12:46,694
you always you wanted I think I think you
want to always explicitly

1096
03:12:47,068 --> 03:12:52,118
upgrade that stuff right so

1097
03:12:53,012 --> 03:13:05,066
when I understand now we need to enable
Kiewit which is on all of them is another
thing I didn't understand and can raise when
I started I just came today

1098
03:13:06,241 --> 03:13:12,542
so what I want to say here

1099
03:13:13,771 --> 03:13:29,877
it was not intuitive to me when some people
use the term control playing at work and I
was just like that I was like what are you
talking about are they computer is it so I'm
going to restate this for myself and others
a kubernetes node is a machine that is
running the cubits

1100
03:13:30,510 --> 03:13:35,318
that's the simple definition in the cupid
includes Senior Care proxy something.

1101
03:13:35,319 --> 03:13:38,893
That's a simple answer there

1102
03:13:38,985 --> 03:14:02,143
here's another thing it's not completely
into it which seems obvious to a lot of
communities people probably they control
plane itself if we're supposed to control
plane a control plane is a kubernetes node
that is also running the components of the
control plane namely at CD controller and
all that then Master Control kind of things
right

1103
03:14:02,263 --> 03:14:12,279
and that's what makes the control plane
here's here's here's the thing is not
completely obvious to beginners like me the
control plane is a node

1104
03:14:13,839 --> 03:14:38,832
you might not use it very much but it in
every other way is to know. And that's good
because when you want to go test everything
in the first place you should test to see if
everything is working is on that system
because that system you can test whether it
has no keep CDL and everything working
because itself itself in itself is a note so
step one get your machine set-up provisioned

1105
03:14:38,835 --> 03:14:54,919
it should be multiple those yes we're not
going to get into Aha and all that stuff you
should be multiple nose bit each each node
is a redundant copy of control and it done
actually confused at the shit out of people

1106
03:14:54,923 --> 03:15:02,494
because they control the control plane
control plane is a role for a node

1107
03:15:02,495 --> 03:15:06,025
control plane is a roll

1108
03:15:06,025 --> 03:16:01,946
of a node and and it is Patrick roces
absolutely right you should never just have
one known you control playing that stupid
ride you should have 3-g have 3-g 4-H a
minimum of three for a chain be here we're
doing testing and stuff right but if you're
doing is the minimum you want is 3 in in a
in a perfect world all three of them should
be a different availability Zone which means
you know there's some sort of physical
separation between them will not tolerate
lower than 5 millisecond latency point 10 at
the maximum I we read about this recently
and we actually at work here I will share
there was an open shift deployment they
tried to put one of their availability
whether a chain control play notes in in the
cloud and then leave the rest on friend and
then it was well over 10

1109
03:16:00,867 --> 03:16:29,951
at 10 ms latency it was well over 10 ms
latency and it destroy the whole cluster so
you can't do that then I have the numbers
written down somewhere but the optimal
latency is point is the think point to Ms or
to Ms yeah yeah so it's it's just really
sensitive I am I get exact numbers for you
if you're going to quote me on that

1110
03:16:30,274 --> 03:16:37,481
I have it in my thing I hope I have it no
sorry guys

1111
03:16:39,101 --> 03:16:45,091
I don't know if I wrote it down at god
dammit god dammit

1112
03:16:45,288 --> 03:16:48,001
it is so mad at myself I didn't write that
down

1113
03:16:56,218 --> 03:17:02,555
I ain't going to be so mad I don't remember
where I put it

1114
03:17:09,181 --> 03:17:16,908
oh there we go are distributed consensus
algorithm and CD limitations that's the one

1115
03:17:17,146 --> 03:17:19,147
so yours is at

1116
03:17:19,936 --> 03:17:28,187
and it said CD that has a limitation it's
the primary is a primary limiter which is
you know the main piece of candy I bet you
that's why I didn't get it

1117
03:17:34,686 --> 03:17:39,230
so

1118
03:17:40,327 --> 03:17:46,996
industry consensus on where the missing you
nominations based on wraps

1119
03:17:47,558 --> 03:17:51,694
oh man I have a good boy I took my took care
I took it today at 10 ms

1120
03:17:52,336 --> 03:18:18,467
yeah I'm about cluster size excetera yeah it
does for absolutely does. She can raise
architecture kind of been working entire
state flower blossom at needs to be composed
of several clusters Francis ever done two
planets are having this is it's like super
sensitive and this is why multi cluster is a
thing and if 95 were here they would confirm
this

1121
03:18:18,470 --> 03:18:24,079
they would confirm this yeah 980 Dino's for
cluster relay

1122
03:18:24,456 --> 03:18:29,159
yeah well I've heard six is it is one of the
good ways to go

1123
03:18:29,229 --> 03:18:39,278
yeah 5 minutes anything Google but you can't
we didn't we didn't we didn't and that's
where this lesson came from

1124
03:18:39,557 --> 03:18:45,524
that's what this lesson came from that you
just

1125
03:18:47,595 --> 03:19:32,935
and I never absolutely yes it has to be not
number that's that's that's if you don't
know anything about consensus on where
things and I didn't to keep a quorum you
have to have an odd number of a long time we
had to I was actually involved in the
project to add an extra one we had to wait
to for like 2 years of friends even here
because I had no idea what I needed to and I
didn't either until I found out I'm sorry I
was reading that so that's the thing I mean
it's not your typical kind of administrative
knowledge you have to know about raft right
it's not admit to being expected you a lot
more than I used to you know they have to
know a lot a lot of extra stuff that they
did have to do before that's why they don't
call me I'm in Seymour

1126
03:19:32,940 --> 03:19:38,138
keep cglre client to client see if you I
said request control plane

1127
03:19:38,407 --> 03:19:53,136
exercise especially close to order yet he
will get Workers just run different
committees conical yes yes it's just it's
all good good restating of the of how that
works cuz I'm going to have that I was so
afraid I'd lost that note

1128
03:19:53,137 --> 03:20:17,946
got any that's why I have is a McKesson
because I cannot remember that shit and I
had to be able to put up fast and I did that
search I get him and boom I had it within 30
seconds if you don't have some sort of like
a search engine driven retrievable second
brain I feel sorry for you because I would
go crazy without mine now hundreds of
workers to his nose running and overloads

1129
03:20:17,949 --> 03:20:21,193
yes yeah

1130
03:20:21,762 --> 03:20:37,330
I know it's not it is not it is not not even
with 107 yeah and they say You're supposed
to get the 5000 those I don't know if
anybody's ever at the time so let's do the
next thing we we got to

1131
03:20:37,331 --> 03:20:42,124
we got our stuff on here how

1132
03:20:42,111 --> 03:20:58,091
how did you know that because they because
it offsets the traffic right because it
distributed you have your because how do you
do you're just you're just riveted to load
balancer in inbound to your API do you
Dennis round-robin Forest you can you talk
to us about that

1133
03:20:59,043 --> 03:21:06,556
Percival I just wondering if you could tell
us about I was wondering if you if you knew

1134
03:21:07,379 --> 03:21:10,700
because that's that's what that's that's why
right

1135
03:21:11,836 --> 03:21:33,965
I see your load balancing your API Inc in
Cumming API request across multiple I'm
assuming you're not just putting at CD on 96
outside of the outside of keeping it inside
cuz you can do that you can do that you have
to maintain it to be independently you can
set up and maintain a CD independently from
kubernetes but I don't recommend in

1136
03:21:34,913 --> 03:21:38,180
dedicating Point Mississippi

1137
03:21:38,736 --> 03:21:43,387
and that one that's it yeah

1138
03:21:44,706 --> 03:21:50,486
is that part of kubernetes this something
you built in him

1139
03:21:52,398 --> 03:21:55,183
that's just a machine load balancer probably

1140
03:21:57,042 --> 03:22:03,752
right yeah but you have an inbound load
balancer free community pericos okay that
makes sense

1141
03:22:03,752 --> 03:22:05,803
ain't ya

1142
03:22:07,593 --> 03:22:13,840
it feels right by Rancher interesting did
not know that they did that I'll have to go
look at that

1143
03:22:15,504 --> 03:22:46,993
yeah it is. Because all everything has to be
STD in fact I was saying that the biggest
one of the biggest pain points in kubernetes
deployment is all the extra pressure on
these controllers are putting on a CD
because he has to have all of that data
controllers or or or STD intensive and
before moving off helmet other stuff like
that for installation and they're building
control that controls are putting pressure
on at CD player of the whole infrastructure
and it stops working

1144
03:22:49,802 --> 03:22:55,696
I got a commercial just happened at Sandy
control do you have them all separate wow

1145
03:22:57,521 --> 03:23:04,001
I mean did you did you security Eminem's
daughter did you suffer is Unisom all and
Sibley

1146
03:23:04,391 --> 03:23:07,894
you probably did the whole long long way
thing

1147
03:23:07,894 --> 03:23:12,790
you got it it sounds like it didn't used to
be the end of it convenient to solve them

1148
03:23:13,403 --> 03:23:23,054
never sent the first time I read about you
ATM and thanks for the father is still need
all their components give you a story of
course.

1149
03:23:23,603 --> 03:23:35,376
Yeah I mean I've noticed is that when I run
into people if it is just an anecdotal thing
so I've noticed it when I run into people
who have

1150
03:23:36,792 --> 03:23:40,935
set up their communities clusters more than
2 years ago

1151
03:23:42,516 --> 03:23:49,780
that they tends to not use Q ATM

1152
03:23:50,591 --> 03:23:56,271
and don't buy Rancher we Define what does a
running which notes

1153
03:23:56,272 --> 03:24:01,297
I found that the reason I'm asking the
question right now is

1154
03:24:01,297 --> 03:24:49,443
I mean when your a beginner and you go to
read the stuff like your ATM you're like oh
you can use this really awesome new tool to
get create is up and running really fast and
quick in your life but you just got you know
you just read all about mini Cube and kind
and how that's the fastest way to get a
cluster up if you're a beginner in you're
looking to study right and then you read
about this this awesome amazing fast
lightweight Cube ATM wait a second give me a
damn is supposed to be provisioning on Prime
clusters from the scratch it just helps to
bootstrap at that way and then you come and
then you finally realize that if you may DM
came along and it in the time at your way I
realize this was looking at Kelsey Hightower
thing I was like what the fuck is this it's
very attitude it wouldn't do it but Kelsey
Hightower the hard way doesn't use Q medium

1155
03:24:49,448 --> 03:25:14,623
it installs every fucking thing
independently with no Cube ATM all of the
individual pieces every single thing at CD
they did buy an Aries instead of running a
damn in the Notre Dame in for a cute Fox for
example you install binary on the nodes you
download the Go by and it when I saw that I
was like oh my god there was a world before
Cube ATM

1156
03:25:15,361 --> 03:25:22,711
and what I talk to people like forced to
hear you know any thanks forhey thanks for
that

1157
03:25:24,042 --> 03:25:51,777
every fucking thing is I agree with that I
agree with that but I feel like doing Cube
ATM and as I said reading through the source
code of this of the phases of installation
of cubed including making a is it the hard
way has you provision all your certificates
in the create down by yourself which I saw
and learn how to do but I mean it does shit
that is just like very tedious and painful
and so you know

1158
03:25:52,101 --> 03:26:03,309
I don't divorce and comedian was not there
from the start though you're saying look you
can either buy some Kelsey where we replace
that CD with console and was amazing really

1159
03:26:04,110 --> 03:26:15,362
yeah and what are you just you just you just
took it in and you say hey these pieces are
all hot swappable basically you just put
another thing in him do it yeah and I'm not
against that I just

1160
03:26:15,865 --> 03:26:33,693
and somebody's trying to help people get get
online quickly for so I think you may DM is
like the perfect you like this is too hot
and this is too cold and Cube ATM is just
right for taking me for for those who are
studying or Baskerville way back before me
when you have

1161
03:26:33,697 --> 03:26:43,541
and I don't remember any of that I'm so I'm
coming the reason I'm going so verbose Lee
into all this shit is because if you're a
beginner to kubernetes

1162
03:26:43,541 --> 03:26:47,090
all the documentation has a particular

1163
03:26:47,285 --> 03:27:15,448
tainted flavor based on his history and it
can be very confusing if you're coming at
the documentation for the first time because
you don't know the history of where
coronavirus came from all you know is you
want to do something besides minikube now
and you don't want to do you know Google
cloud or whatever so you want to start
playing with it and yeah it was before Arbok
really

1164
03:27:15,450 --> 03:27:21,359
so even the c k references cubania mug

1165
03:27:21,359 --> 03:28:10,280
why I think it's supposed to know and for
those who are like really like a hundred
eggs kubernetes admins who built their own
infrastructure from scratch every component
from scratch by the way there's downsides to
that the only time we ever had a full 24
hour outage in our communities close to her
was because our search expired because we
did STD as an independent entity from Q ATM
and Canadian would have saved us from that
because every time you upgrade with Q ATM
and you have that CD built-in is not just
you baby I'm but anytime you have that CD
this built-in it will automatically
reprovision you're still gets an update him
on every single communities upgrade if you
don't do that and I'm signing this as one
example of why

1166
03:28:10,284 --> 03:28:17,393
I'm I think if I were asked as a contractor
to help somebody set up their communities
closer I would stick with you ATM

1167
03:28:17,394 --> 03:28:38,719
because because it covers so many of the
things that are that are so I say somebody's
got gobs of money they want to throw at you
and they say hey come set up or internal
carre's cluster we have this minimal amount
of this mineral cost to requirements always
search T & S RV GPS and I think so I don't
know

1168
03:28:38,721 --> 03:29:01,498
I don't remember but if the point of trying
to make here is you have a if you're a
contractor you've been contracted to set up
your dates for yourself or for others if
answer question do you suggest they use the
cloud was just probably what you're going to
suggest the most people just like you said
yes to most people that they look weird for
us instead of teaching them how to do you
know do you know rest API development

1169
03:29:01,499 --> 03:29:21,519
you wouldn't do that to most customers right
if you have a customer comes to you right if
a customer comes in and say I want to raise
closer is a hey go what what do you want to
do with it while I want to do X and Y and I
think I'm doing they say I want a high
performance Machinery cluster and I paid
gobs of money for all these gpus that we
have on Prime and I want to run the cluster
on friend what's the answer

1170
03:29:21,519 --> 03:29:29,335
the answer is obviously you're building it
on Prime cluster obviously but then the next
question is how do you build out that on
friend cluster

1171
03:29:31,216 --> 03:30:02,244
you know I did not yet how do you build out
that I'm from cluster do you do the simple
way and use Cube ATM and just you just trust
that you've ATM administrators everybody's
been in there or do you go there since you
know if you go the extra mile and you like
in provisioned into play all of it
individual components of it and maybe evil
tweak it in like swap out and you know it's
a TV for console or some shit like that they
provide your own anger is your day going to
be doing metal lb and things like that for
these are all the batteries that have to be
added

1172
03:30:00,856 --> 03:30:06,474
the added are you pay for openshift and I
got to tell you that's what they going to do

1173
03:30:07,508 --> 03:30:11,932
do I like that fuck know that is exactly
what they're going to do

1174
03:30:13,085 --> 03:30:17,387
that's what they're doing though that's what
they're doing they're paying 40.

1175
03:30:17,849 --> 03:30:44,253
Ida teams are already using for bruising
General and he got to maintain a long-term
absolutely I couldn't tell ya what what are
most companies going to do especially the
companies that are already buying shit from
Red Hat and already on their subscription
service for their for their package updates
and everything and I know all about that cuz
I was IBM free night. That's what we're
going to do the on doing that shit they are
they're going to go run at

1176
03:30:44,258 --> 03:30:46,662
I don't I'm not saying I like it

1177
03:30:47,022 --> 03:30:54,254
but that is the easiest most reliable way to
go and and they can pay red heifer support

1178
03:30:58,084 --> 03:30:59,799
no

1179
03:31:04,044 --> 03:31:10,397
so that's why they don't really learn things
they only know they only know the open
Chick-fil-A yeah

1180
03:31:10,415 --> 03:31:13,561
and the Run vmz Qbert

1181
03:31:15,258 --> 03:31:23,627
did you see cute kid native got serverless K
native is coming back like a native made
another I read that in the news today

1182
03:31:24,193 --> 03:31:30,945
yeah I could buy on Prime Ivan Biser yeah
yeah

1183
03:31:32,235 --> 03:31:38,560
I am so skeptical of converts I am totally
skeptical of it

1184
03:31:40,521 --> 03:31:47,940
noocube number three now and yeah is that
nuts not middle of me is it

1185
03:31:48,448 --> 03:31:55,373
which one is that I haven't heard of that
one yet I've been saying Koreans are metals
going to be coming for a long time

1186
03:31:55,631 --> 03:32:01,892
yeah yep and that's it this is like the
sitter or stuff to write you guys about tell
us right

1187
03:32:03,857 --> 03:32:12,414
same thing they're doing they're doing bare
metal committed in prison as well you just
can't get into it you can't get into the
hood it's completely lockdown

1188
03:32:12,985 --> 03:32:19,913
try to mix water with the well I don't know
I don't know it's going to be interesting

1189
03:32:20,083 --> 03:32:36,500
okay ways I am just right okay so what what
started us on this is huge awesome tangent
that only Enterprise you kind of people are
really probably going to care about I don't
care I'm an enterprising person doing an
Enterprise a job right now

1190
03:32:36,501 --> 03:32:39,384
so my question is

1191
03:32:40,166 --> 03:32:44,624
well I thought we answered already it's
openshift

1192
03:32:44,992 --> 03:32:52,635
now you're going to get a number of people
they're going to say okay so let's pretend
that they don't go right out route what
would be the next best answer

1193
03:32:53,013 --> 03:32:58,368
keabadian right at least Cube ATM is

1194
03:32:58,369 --> 03:33:04,638
not going to overly tax the kubernetes
skills of your infrastructure team

1195
03:33:05,973 --> 03:33:12,594
you think they were going to Rancher haha
Jenna link

1196
03:33:13,519 --> 03:33:19,382
yeah the link to that to the Rancho stuff
thing

1197
03:33:21,041 --> 03:33:25,018
well I know her enviable oh my God

1198
03:33:26,130 --> 03:33:34,257
no I was looking specifically for the link
for their for their for their Arcane project
products

1199
03:33:34,952 --> 03:33:44,842
all right so so where does that leave us
right

1200
03:33:46,697 --> 03:33:51,209
so I guess I'm speaking to the obvious you
want to learn how to do this stuff

1201
03:33:52,539 --> 03:34:35,692
he is Addison communication, yes the side
that's how I remember I actually started two
years ago two years ago I started down that
urinates passes and you've no need to pick
it up and and I provisionally back minis
with Rancher and it was awesome ohmygod is
so cool you you put you take your USB stick
and you put your foot in front of public key
on the stick and you can provision of the
hardware straight up into Rancher it just
just boot right into the cluster is so cool
I guess this side path he wasn't asking a
question is to ATM the way to go for

1202
03:34:35,696 --> 03:34:42,057
hobbyists or or is there is there something
more palatable in we're going to

1203
03:34:41,382 --> 03:35:12,701
we're going to throw out the chips I'm not
going to do open shift I mean I've already
bought into red hat is the Adeno sent to us
Elmo whatever as the base of us because it's
the most likely to encounter my the reason I
get it I said I want to get you a job wanted
to do skills are going to be relevant what
are the most if you're in a build a cluster
at home what cluster is going to give you
the most relevant sign okay 3s yeah I think
you be able to set up single or clusters
under the only beings

1204
03:35:14,559 --> 03:35:18,519
are they are they are they provision with
vagrant like I've been doing doctor room

1205
03:35:19,023 --> 03:35:28,988
I mean imagine it would have to do that so
you know what you raise a good point that I
still think you baby I miss very viable
particularly for those who want to develop
system software for kubernetes

1206
03:35:29,352 --> 03:35:36,642
because it's better than many Cube you can't
write a storage class driver

1207
03:35:36,642 --> 03:35:52,645
using mini Cube you have to use a full
kubernetes environment through one and
keeping him as a fast way to get you that so
thank you for saying so that that validates
my decision to continue down the path
security and learning how to provision with
Kik Cube am because

1208
03:35:52,890 --> 03:35:58,105
because if you just look at Enterprise
deployments there's not enough justification
for that

1209
03:35:59,160 --> 03:36:31,994
you know if you're just looking at hey I
want to maintain and and and work with
Enterprise to Plymouth then you probably
should learn open shift or you probably
shouldn't Rancher the chances of you walking
in the door for some in a middle of a
company that wants to communities and them
not picking Cloud open shift and say they
really want to be out of the box kind of
like ours like that Machinery they have
customization want to do then you're going
to be using to medium or you're going to be
you're going to be building your own stuff
and then you going to get burned by certs
expiring like we did

1210
03:36:31,997 --> 03:36:39,052
so yeah I just drank your video and I said
to myself interesting

1211
03:36:39,563 --> 03:36:47,261
ansible yeah well yeah I mean I'm going to
revisit the ansible thing

1212
03:36:49,484 --> 03:37:46,963
this or things that I'm doing with a
provision extra extra remote volumes I don't
know that I maybe there's a hook to do it
but it's definitely a bending ansible
password it's designed to do right as well
as not designed for provisioning bm's I mean
as his core golemancer people are doing it
but I haven't played around with that you
have yet to the reason I'm asking all these
questions is because I am learning animals
helping other people learn and I want to
make sure that the stuff was learning is
relevant excetera in an and that's that's
the reasons we went to to making over knows
our communities virtual machines into red
hat because the chances of you running into
a kubernetes know that out in the wild and
Enterprise in particular that's not read had
a pretty low you might find some of my stuff
out there but

1213
03:37:46,968 --> 03:38:46,264
so and just for the other beginners out
there what does it mean for you the beginner
boost is going to cover were going to use
Adobe intuitive and canonical at whatever as
your first Lennox and then I'm going to do
we're going to do red hat when we come in
for structure engineering as our base
install because those are the two primary
distributions primary eye most popular just
as we can fight over what your favorite just
do all day that's fine that's when you said
you know what's a box you can try them all
out and send it when you want you can make
your own decisions but but when it comes to
skills that apply across the board haven't
you knowing apt and an napt package manager
system and knowing young and you know RPM
base system that covers probably ninety
percent of what you encounter in the
infrastructure space and is it in out there

1214
03:38:46,270 --> 03:38:49,058
a provisioning Wikipedia am definitely make
sense

1215
03:38:49,059 --> 03:39:22,232
that version of Ring of migration so painful
yeah that that's funny that's so funny you
say that because that's like Siri we have to
go through that one at one of the reasons
I'm doing this I'm kind of going to be no
spoiler alert right what are the reasons I'm
doing all of this is because we have to
prepare for a 12 to upgrade and I want to go
through the 12 to upgrade without Andy being
anywhere near the real McCluster I want to
know what the steps are for the upgrade and
I want to be able to do that in a real
environment you know a true environment not

1216
03:39:20,933 --> 03:39:41,319
environment not a Mini Cooper something so
the reason to do this VM stuff that I'm
doing is many many many reasons this you
know how do you install it first of all
understand what has to be done what to see
and I but beyond that it's like it is
probably take me to 119 yeah that is
customary Developers

1217
03:39:41,588 --> 03:40:13,909
yes there is there is really miss my wife
just came to me and gave me the it's dinner
time. So I'm going to step away from it
there's many other great streamers right now
if you want to if you want to choose this
time to go do that I'm not going to be
closing this trained most of this for the
sake of practicality people want to keep
talking here we go play around with multiple
muscle pain stuff it's like really fun to go
to that when I was a good one would you stop
over here

1218
03:40:13,913 --> 03:40:39,333
now or something else when I come back
though and I want to stay awake because I
really really really need to get this is so
so I can start to do my software testing and
I want to start making calls the rest API so
I'm going to try really hard to stay awake
and work on it so I should be back within 10
20 30 minutes unless something strange
happens

1219
03:40:39,336 --> 03:40:44,216
so I'm going to say back in 20 and will do
that see you in a bit

1220
04:00:43,534 --> 04:00:49,925
all right let's go back and do some more
stuff

1221
04:00:56,248 --> 04:01:00,016
what are we doing here Mom

1222
04:01:02,372 --> 04:01:08,200
what kind of keyboard install and use the
song go ahead and try to do I join Kelly

1223
04:01:10,470 --> 04:01:17,940
I think we need for the fire alarm but I do
think we need to turn the fire off I don't
think the fire was going to be able to talk

1224
04:01:18,215 --> 04:01:23,931
is there any way Cuban ATM and its

1225
04:01:24,880 --> 04:01:31,048
oh I didn't all three and we don't want that
that's bad bad wrong bad Rob

1226
04:01:31,718 --> 04:01:39,293
I just dropped my thing set time you

1227
04:01:40,535 --> 04:01:45,938
synchronize pains false damn it

1228
04:01:52,171 --> 04:01:55,317
Ariel

1229
04:01:56,908 --> 04:02:04,174
I only made an able to find I bet if I do
remember where to find out though stim Ctrl

1230
04:02:06,036 --> 04:02:13,187
yeah thank you sza Ctrl

1231
04:02:13,806 --> 04:02:20,278
find Aldi status I got in the wrong order

1232
04:02:23,208 --> 04:02:28,658
it is running now we're going to just bring
that off

1233
04:02:29,848 --> 04:02:37,164
already know that so we tried the house and
we could all try I'll try but you're not
sure about

1234
04:02:38,423 --> 04:02:41,093
I was going to need to see and I not working
this week

1235
04:02:44,749 --> 04:02:51,628
last time we did this I mean if you don't
turn it all the way off gate if you do kind
and it made a few qbdm in it

1236
04:02:55,158 --> 04:03:00,967
so you never replied all right so the reason
is doing this is because

1237
04:03:01,152 --> 04:03:03,282
it wants

1238
04:03:04,049 --> 04:03:12,044
I will need to be turned off with since your
ports are open to your cluster not function
correctly

1239
04:03:15,805 --> 04:03:20,647
I don't remember how to open forces far all
day and Human Services on labeled

1240
04:03:20,872 --> 04:03:27,882
oh and we didn't talk to you about service
on yeah that's actually we should have been
last time in the last step

1241
04:03:27,025 --> 04:03:30,520
yes you don't hear how it turns out you so
let's do that

1242
04:03:36,349 --> 04:03:42,380
and Restless to cubelet C

1243
04:03:43,122 --> 04:03:51,059
Sim Ctrl enable Dash dress now it's activate
to start keeping it

1244
04:03:52,181 --> 04:03:57,386
there we go status

1245
04:03:58,276 --> 04:04:05,802
activating it still says activating

1246
04:04:06,870 --> 04:04:12,866
when I activate Ed a week is this

1247
04:04:15,068 --> 04:04:20,126
statues Cube Outlet

1248
04:04:28,912 --> 04:04:36,589
uh-oh why isn't it on that's a good

1249
04:04:46,775 --> 04:04:49,964
why does it say activating instead of off

1250
04:04:52,747 --> 04:04:55,677
how to make an egg to make it to the final

1251
04:04:58,317 --> 04:05:05,242
we make it starts cuz I can figure we did
this

1252
04:05:06,510 --> 04:05:08,025
as a repo

1253
04:05:08,727 --> 04:05:25,686
oh no no no no no no no. I remember the
instructions they said it will come up but
it won't actually do anything cuz it can't
talk yeah I remember now I remember you said
you were sexy in the docks so

1254
04:05:26,984 --> 04:05:30,318
set time you synchronize panes off

1255
04:05:30,972 --> 04:05:35,867
all right we're going to try to keep medium
here and it's going to croak because of the
firewall

1256
04:05:36,576 --> 04:05:43,075
I mean it'll work you just won't you just
won't do anything with me to talk to him and
this problem for him

1257
04:05:44,145 --> 04:05:47,947
oh here we go there's the checks for IV
tables

1258
04:05:51,066 --> 04:05:55,008
if Thou shalt have the checks for a tables
or you cannot work

1259
04:05:55,493 --> 04:05:59,243
so this stuff is required

1260
04:05:59,913 --> 04:06:09,522
is this other stuff I don't know let's just
try this stuff right here shall we I'm going
to yank this out using my my handy-dandy
yanker

1261
04:06:09,523 --> 04:06:11,690
so that I can do this

1262
04:06:18,192 --> 04:06:22,433
can you make a pain bigger why

1263
04:06:24,427 --> 04:06:29,644
these bigger I can

1264
04:06:31,604 --> 04:06:38,829
but it would make his letter C small for you
to read I'm going to do this way to say

1265
04:06:44,625 --> 04:06:47,035
yeah with wise

1266
04:06:47,504 --> 04:06:53,855
I know I don't know which one this one I
already know what that is this is zoom which
is using

1267
04:06:54,334 --> 04:06:57,394
if this is there any ivy table setting

1268
04:06:57,564 --> 04:07:03,739
yeah that's the same thing that we know
about from before so I'm going to be adding
those two lines type of cables

1269
04:07:08,728 --> 04:07:16,020
when I can ignore pre-flight we're going to
turn it on I said let's do that let's say

1270
04:07:17,469 --> 04:07:20,301
Shi

1271
04:07:24,987 --> 04:07:27,440
tempeh

1272
04:07:27,897 --> 04:07:33,244
let me go so that set the IP table stuff to
every system

1273
04:07:33,244 --> 04:07:39,802
that is also already in Artemis Fowl

1274
04:07:41,891 --> 04:07:48,793
Kate's since that we didn't do them on
overlea thing

1275
04:07:48,794 --> 04:07:52,424
I don't know if it needs to come and get her
or not that's what I'm trying to test

1276
04:07:59,850 --> 04:08:02,820
I don't know about this so

1277
04:08:17,840 --> 04:08:20,867
so you do systemctl and all

1278
04:08:30,246 --> 04:08:35,617
yeah yeah that's the dark I've been reading
before

1279
04:08:37,062 --> 04:08:43,066
yeah that's a good one but that one in the
in the read me

1280
04:08:55,948 --> 04:09:01,945
does do cgl

1281
04:09:02,547 --> 04:09:10,147
I don't actually know it's it's ETL system
what is c c c c l

1282
04:09:13,414 --> 04:09:18,876
if your girlfriend RZR 170

1283
04:09:21,023 --> 04:09:24,555
that must be the man probably start like we
have to do stuff to do

1284
04:09:28,209 --> 04:09:36,157
Mom shit that's cool alright let's try or
nothing now

1285
04:09:40,754 --> 04:09:43,527
I need to find a hockey for that you're
right

1286
04:09:48,831 --> 04:09:55,970
all right we're going to do Q ATM in it

1287
04:09:57,973 --> 04:10:03,663
are felt content tables does not exist

1288
04:10:09,530 --> 04:10:12,356
I don't know why that's a problem

1289
04:10:14,183 --> 04:10:19,668
Roxas net bridge bridge enough calling
potatoes

1290
04:10:24,119 --> 04:10:28,716
interesting it looks directly for the file
that's named that

1291
04:10:30,401 --> 04:10:39,504
Roxas net bridge bridge and have coffee
tables or stuff not on that's why I'm

1292
04:10:40,547 --> 04:10:45,367
yep so that means this does have to actually
happen

1293
04:11:05,284 --> 04:11:06,890
so

1294
04:11:19,491 --> 04:11:26,708
run that buffer all right my problem is you
are my problem now

1295
04:11:32,009 --> 04:11:34,718
I need a key for this

1296
04:11:37,279 --> 04:11:41,945
are there right now I did it by system to
jail yeah

1297
04:11:43,148 --> 04:11:46,996
I didn't I didn't system an assistant to
tell system

1298
04:11:47,122 --> 04:11:52,183
but I didn't I didn't do the mods the first
message that again

1299
04:11:53,287 --> 04:12:00,378
so I think the mud probably going to create
a creative thinking I don't know if I know

1300
04:12:16,264 --> 04:12:17,922
yeah

1301
04:12:19,248 --> 04:12:27,746
I think it did I think there's some files
that got created by whether or not that was
enough without having to rewrite the other
thing I don't know we're going to try that
out right now

1302
04:12:28,474 --> 04:12:32,301
so let's try that let's do

1303
04:12:42,884 --> 04:12:48,406
we're going to simplify to check I'm
guessing problem I know we didn't thatthat
was enough

1304
04:12:48,810 --> 04:12:52,294
so if I can get that module thing can go in
a separate time

1305
04:12:58,431 --> 04:13:00,311
it was like no I don't want to talk about

1306
04:13:03,030 --> 04:13:07,503
oh I put the mods in my probes I found
everything I do I didn't I put it on this
one

1307
04:13:09,867 --> 04:13:13,339
arguing and everything I don't know if we do

1308
04:13:16,298 --> 04:13:18,881
yeah I know. I've been funny

1309
04:13:26,156 --> 04:13:27,581
yes

1310
04:13:31,122 --> 04:13:34,448
so there's are are joining thing

1311
04:13:36,250 --> 04:13:42,168
and I've been feeling this one's going to
fail mostly because

1312
04:13:46,827 --> 04:13:48,524
because of the firewall

1313
04:13:50,866 --> 04:13:58,714
and see how it's to be the first time ever
and ever do systemctl cloudy

1314
04:13:59,615 --> 04:14:06,696
stop firewall D or disabled now

1315
04:14:10,957 --> 04:14:13,656
that's amazing that it is work out of that

1316
04:14:19,484 --> 04:14:23,469
V with the vehicles 5 order yeah

1317
04:14:27,786 --> 04:14:32,583
she's going to fantasize about those New
Jersey and I remember that one

1318
04:14:47,418 --> 04:14:55,120
that is doing it is the 10. Network to your
ass is not using the IP numbers do you think
that's weird

1319
04:14:57,432 --> 04:15:04,185
I kind of wanted to use the IP numbers like
the non 10:10. So I wanted to use the yeah

1320
04:15:05,175 --> 04:15:10,848
we need to do the network thing where we
tell it what never to use yeah

1321
04:15:11,614 --> 04:15:17,840
so I think we need to you haven't used it
the right now work

1322
04:15:19,497 --> 04:15:37,162
yes now we actually need cement network
configuration we absolutely do we need it
before we need to do that there's an extra
command line that tells you the c i t c h e
r for the Pod thing on that right and I
don't remember I'm going to go get up so
there's

1323
04:15:37,419 --> 04:15:44,471
yeah there's a yeah if you're a Survivor
ties well I didn't know about that one

1324
04:15:46,381 --> 04:15:49,755
what's what's on a server advertise address

1325
04:15:50,539 --> 04:16:00,389
well that will that will all this year as
yours get picked up from that automatically
for the for the pazzi annihilator remember
we're supposed to do in it and then dash
dash whatever

1326
04:16:00,390 --> 04:16:13,845
and it's there's a network thing as related
to that is like something cidr that never
said you are when that be the same I mean I
got to read about this this option I got to
read about this option

1327
04:16:14,694 --> 04:16:20,022
Chi-Chi Madman Dashie age

1328
04:16:20,901 --> 04:16:32,713
turn on network configuration out it's not
it's different that's just for the pods to
see my right alright I got you

1329
04:16:33,297 --> 04:16:35,564
alrighty

1330
04:16:36,363 --> 04:16:42,911
I want to read about that though

1331
04:16:52,507 --> 04:16:59,703
humanium and then Dash age

1332
04:17:00,978 --> 04:17:07,916
I need to read all of this but edit
PreFlight certs

1333
04:17:09,111 --> 04:17:12,201
yeah Pi Network CPR

1334
04:17:12,855 --> 04:17:20,838
eventually we probably still need to do that
though I would think that that would still
be needed and it certainly not going to hurt

1335
04:17:20,838 --> 04:17:27,992
right I think it's probably good is it true
or false it's good

1336
04:17:27,157 --> 04:17:39,132
it's good practice to just at your apartment
at work cidr anyway it's not going to hurt
and I going to hurt anything right I think I
need to memorize that as a thing you should
just do we should do tonight or what

1337
04:17:39,447 --> 04:17:46,077
any teas that ain't Calicut a serving okay

1338
04:17:48,865 --> 04:17:50,326
interesting

1339
04:17:58,435 --> 04:18:01,102
what I'm thinking about is I need

1340
04:18:30,821 --> 04:18:34,090
I was at the the default

1341
04:18:35,527 --> 04:18:40,947
yeah but how about know the default what
number the funk is a VIP server advertise
address

1342
04:18:47,531 --> 04:18:50,289
I am implying it from it

1343
04:19:01,063 --> 04:19:03,692
I guess I'm Burns Buy in Pines Road

1344
04:19:08,704 --> 04:19:11,023
I think we would have to specify right

1345
04:19:31,143 --> 04:19:36,391
I get a strong impression that I need to put
this no matter what just to make myself feel
safe

1346
04:19:38,803 --> 04:19:45,170
92. 168. 0 0 what is 16

1347
04:19:46,919 --> 04:19:48,364
Ciara

1348
04:20:03,996 --> 04:20:08,231
I got it I can't tell her I'm a hard time
finding a p I should run Docs

1349
04:20:11,372 --> 04:20:14,481
if your server advertise address

1350
04:20:15,105 --> 04:20:24,581
is it a store advertised a dress code is
that probably should be changed if you're
going to do a load balancer as well right
I'm thinking that you would probably want to
change that

1351
04:20:34,284 --> 04:20:40,707
generic ranges once the positive Falls son's
head over services or staff also has 80

1352
04:20:43,241 --> 04:20:47,692
if that's the case then you wouldn't need
this if it's just using the default

1353
04:20:51,129 --> 04:20:53,072
this is like

1354
04:21:07,530 --> 04:21:12,525
is there one for services to is there like a
Services Network cidr

1355
04:21:13,509 --> 04:21:15,672
I bet there is

1356
04:21:31,828 --> 04:21:36,724
service DNS to mainstream God is so much
stuff

1357
04:21:47,683 --> 04:21:52,143
I think it would help me out with an
outright I would like to see that written
somewhere

1358
04:21:52,472 --> 04:21:57,598
but then you know your overriding the fault
if there's oil changes which is probably a
good thing

1359
04:22:02,503 --> 04:22:07,591
okay I did Pastor advertise a drawstring the
IP address the

1360
04:22:06,640 --> 04:22:16,461
API server will advertise its listening on
if not set the default network interface
will be used and that's the not an interface
that we don't want

1361
04:22:18,511 --> 04:22:20,100
alright so

1362
04:22:46,759 --> 04:22:48,345
hey I'm going to take file

1363
04:22:53,481 --> 04:22:55,593
I can hate medium box but

1364
04:23:03,275 --> 04:23:10,616
shit I did not know this this phenomenal

1365
04:23:11,780 --> 04:23:14,358
I would much rather do that than fuck around
with this

1366
04:23:18,510 --> 04:23:20,179
this is super cool

1367
04:23:21,599 --> 04:23:34,409
have you been for service dragonface repatha
created a vowel

1368
04:23:34,667 --> 04:23:36,835
Osaka and turn run

1369
04:23:36,964 --> 04:23:44,648
that's what I run but not know that I didn't
pass extensions Silver City I said it does
have a service cidr

1370
04:23:46,102 --> 04:23:52,569
oh hey look it's 10. Now and it's not it's
not what I do anymore

1371
04:23:52,866 --> 04:23:59,196
I'm at the doctor wrong hey how's it going
H-E-B in gang

1372
04:24:02,220 --> 04:24:08,906
yeah I kind of think that we should get in
the habit of making it a big wild.

1373
04:24:09,609 --> 04:24:17,298
Can you run dry run and get the output and
yellow okay

1374
04:24:19,092 --> 04:24:28,114
I think it did you said no no you did it you
did sorry I thought I had when I turn my
head so I saw a different one night to
address range

1375
04:24:28,116 --> 04:24:30,151
alright so

1376
04:24:30,152 --> 04:24:46,393
so that's good I mean I can potentially see
that being on a vacation that's what is the
default Network range for services in
kubernetes what is the default Network range
for pods in the Pod in the center policy and
I you know when I do 168

1377
04:24:54,763 --> 04:24:57,532
Zapata Network cidr

1378
04:25:06,230 --> 04:25:11,303
yeah I think I said that I have everything

1379
04:25:11,325 --> 04:25:17,283
and services Through The Eyes of a Range
Rover

1380
04:25:17,798 --> 04:25:20,426
customer service radar

1381
04:25:21,644 --> 04:25:27,103
there's no strange that's good that we need
to know that how did you get that

1382
04:25:28,048 --> 04:25:32,988
did you get if you drive around this and
have it dumped out all that stuff

1383
04:25:33,483 --> 04:25:39,906
picture of Samara source Minnesota viciously
fast really

1384
04:25:40,353 --> 04:25:44,061
is there another strange Rocky IP addresses
yes

1385
04:25:44,666 --> 04:25:50,442
is it going to service address change this
at this range must not be within a network
range

1386
04:25:50,444 --> 04:25:56,779
and must not be used anywhere else for the
purpose we'll use the racing at 2

1387
04:25:56,779 --> 04:26:02,363
years of trial and error no but I'm trying
to say is like

1388
04:26:02,456 --> 04:26:05,071
I'm thinking

1389
04:26:05,071 --> 04:26:12,022
they should have been some of the commands I
have dry runs you can do right and it will
just dump it for you

1390
04:26:12,253 --> 04:26:17,884
yeah I'm thinking know though

1391
04:26:18,126 --> 04:26:24,904
how can I create a kubernetes

1392
04:26:24,904 --> 04:26:27,647
give ATM

1393
04:26:27,648 --> 04:26:36,560
I mean obviously you can just have a temple
right so I think this is would be more in
the money for me to remind remember

1394
04:26:36,561 --> 04:26:39,438
so that's why I'm asking

1395
04:26:39,439 --> 04:26:47,954
I am I think having you know if I would help
me remember better so security

1396
04:26:46,818 --> 04:26:53,114
if you're going to call the QT mccaig wow
well there you go you go bowling down

1397
04:26:54,969 --> 04:26:56,077
and he keeps it in his face

1398
04:26:57,274 --> 04:27:03,459
is it red in the commune join there you go
there is one and go get one from existing
closer

1399
04:27:03,901 --> 04:27:11,110
yeah so it makes me want to do mini tube
kind custard we have a kind cluster

1400
04:27:12,135 --> 04:27:17,136
and if we can get one this way kind of
cluster

1401
04:27:22,062 --> 04:27:28,477
I got my computer going to be yelling at me
kind create cluster

1402
04:27:31,140 --> 04:27:38,419
it was just a fault hyppo sister that let's
go grab that that

1403
04:27:39,146 --> 04:27:40,966
accurate a fig

1404
04:27:43,222 --> 04:27:53,384
I'm doing for the command line

1405
04:27:57,061 --> 04:28:03,558
there's no Community running and get the
config yeah

1406
04:28:04,274 --> 04:28:09,270

1413
04:29:04,551 --> 04:29:10,619
I I did this is this is great I want to see
how close is configured

1414
04:29:10,993 --> 04:29:18,468
Naruto go alright so

1415
04:29:19,969 --> 04:29:27,177
so so so play should have been an investment
I have it right I actually could

1416
04:29:28,235 --> 04:29:31,833
now he's a host or not mounting on the host

1417
04:29:35,598 --> 04:29:37,721
so yeah

1418
04:29:40,867 --> 04:29:45,540
yeah I'm going to come back to this one
later after I know what I'm doing

1419
04:29:49,449 --> 04:29:51,555
so

what how much of this do we actually change
authorization mode no darmok runs like a pig

1422
04:30:26,107 --> 04:30:28,929
oh you found something like that

1423
04:30:30,036 --> 04:30:36,875
oh my god well that's much easier that's way
easier thank you

1424
04:30:38,229 --> 04:30:40,877
I think I was looking for

look like I N Point advertised address 1234
really

1432
04:31:41,741 --> 04:31:46,990
why couldn't you like I said I've

1433
04:31:47,819 --> 04:31:52,307
thank you it's just the terminology monks
but thank you for saying so

1434
04:31:55,418 --> 04:32:00,569
and I'll look crazy socket. My God this is
all fucked up

1435
04:32:02,015 --> 04:32:03,985
we don't have dr. shim

1436
04:32:04,278 --> 04:32:12,717
this is great I love this because this helps
me know all the things I need to change I
remember we passed that last time too and it
would have worked if we had to change it

1437
04:32:13,229 --> 04:32:15,138
cuz there's no doctor soon

1438
04:32:16,426 --> 04:32:25,146
I remember we changed we built an entire
different Cube ATM thing so did you get an
STD

1439
04:32:26,142 --> 04:32:34,074
what are the TD kind of close to
configuration wages is 7 thing unless the
same thing

1440
04:32:34,306 --> 04:32:35,484
oh

1441
04:32:36,133 --> 04:32:50,775
it kind of seems like it

1442
04:32:52,188 --> 04:33:00,563
I mean okay the reason I like this is cuz
this gives me straight up an example of what
to expect right

1443
04:33:02,345 --> 04:33:08,413
so here's your internet configuration see
this is the different object it says nothing
about you except I was expecting

1444
04:33:09,644 --> 04:33:12,970
this is not communicative at me I need to
read more

1445
04:33:13,893 --> 04:33:20,534
this is exactly very sure and yes it is and
I was just reading about right so

1446
04:33:22,174 --> 04:33:24,056
cluster config

1447
04:33:26,824 --> 04:33:34,422
why does it have a time out for control
plane interesting and why is that why is
that a subtype of API server

1448
04:33:36,970 --> 04:33:52,446
seems odd to me I've never seen if you do if
your server is not a p i e p i e server got
it got it got just moved it around instead
of being in the normal order

1449
04:33:53,367 --> 04:33:57,623
you know I just got kind of threw me so

1450
04:34:02,634 --> 04:34:09,875
Yvonne Zima yeah I mean that's where all the
schemes are yeah I remember that thank you
for that yeah

1451
04:34:10,698 --> 04:34:18,457
can I still get directory a cluster name
caretti's DNS no DNS to do my TV

1452
04:34:18,458 --> 04:34:26,953
is your pulse rate as soon as Bates is going
to Duke or DNS by default which it did last
time when I did Grey's version

1453
04:34:30,667 --> 04:34:34,211
never getting a DNS to main cluster local

1454
04:34:35,156 --> 04:34:45,274
a service some that others are some that
were looking for him and it is because it's
this is not the

1455
04:34:46,981 --> 04:34:49,929
I got the Pod addressing

1456
04:34:53,983 --> 04:34:55,717
yeah

1457
04:34:56,905 --> 04:35:05,650
I mean I don't needed to deal went to delve
into this I'm just I find it very
interesting so let's do the other one let's
do

1458
04:35:05,651 --> 04:35:11,350
join default have a feeling to join the
Foster going to have the machine I don't
work right

1459
04:35:14,167 --> 04:35:16,734
join llamo

1460
04:35:17,480 --> 04:35:25,220
causes of cluster which makes sense there is
no cluster config

1461
04:35:28,259 --> 04:35:30,737
yes it does

1462
04:35:36,398 --> 04:35:39,703
yeah we need to we need to fix that

1463
04:35:43,023 --> 04:35:46,239
I guess it wouldn't hurt you to sign away

1464
04:35:46,240 --> 04:36:01,373
yeah but that's a bad thing we don't want I
do not want to overlapping At Work's biggest
thing for most working issues is a pain in
the ass in

1465
04:36:01,375 --> 04:36:06,233
communities I'm out with strap tank of
Eurasian doctors why does it keep saying

1466
04:36:12,435 --> 04:36:15,704
I thought install integrity was going to fix
all that

1467
04:36:42,403 --> 04:36:48,806
activate in The Fall Guys yes at parts we
need to know

1468
04:36:59,553 --> 04:37:06,782
there's no darker skin

1469
04:37:13,997 --> 04:37:17,094
is it just depends on how it's supposed to
be wanted me you know

1470
04:37:23,568 --> 04:37:31,518
yeah I feel like when you're running it yeah

1471
04:37:35,773 --> 04:37:37,072
well

1472
04:38:00,726 --> 04:38:03,743
what's the cidr to jump past

1473
04:38:06,527 --> 04:38:09,225
I have to put the first numbers in there
right

1474
04:38:13,529 --> 04:38:17,280
I don't know I have to change the cidr value
and get rid of the first ones

1475
04:38:18,436 --> 04:38:25,138
cuz it's all a bit white stuff I'd have to
figure that out. I don't spend time do it if
I if I want to split

1476
04:38:25,408 --> 04:38:33,116
if I want to split the same 24/7 mask mint
Summit mask

1477
04:38:37,225 --> 04:38:42,447
sort something out there ask what's the
subnet mask I just

1478
04:38:42,737 --> 04:39:02,425
is this so much fucking Something cover for
people and I know about it but it's like I
can't imagine trying to teach all this
you've got to know now working you can't
step into this world until you know not
working like you know what a subnet mask is
and all that stuff it's you can't you just
can't do it and so that's why the
infrastructure stuff comes first

1479
04:39:03,349 --> 04:39:13,190
I mean I can't fix it now

1480
04:39:14,701 --> 04:39:22,089
what did you what did you find his new books
on t w o r r e 24 God

1481
04:39:22,387 --> 04:39:33,448
more fucking read the doc's I just want this
for the whole thing and I look their
configuration I was tempted to write a book
on read the docs and I looked at their setup
and I was like fuck no

1482
04:39:39,634 --> 04:39:45,117
very scary this is approach

1483
04:39:45,163 --> 04:39:49,176
I know why people do it cuz it's nice and
easy to just works but

1484
04:39:52,144 --> 04:39:53,828
yeah

1485
04:40:33,542 --> 04:40:37,705
do do do do do do do

1486
04:40:41,276 --> 04:40:48,515
thank you for that all right all right

1487
04:40:52,917 --> 04:41:00,897
it is at 17 and then I would stand with that
makes sense yeah obviously

1488
04:41:01,092 --> 04:41:02,933
what's that

1489
04:41:07,633 --> 04:41:14,485
I need to write this down though because
yeah I need a ride. I don't want to lose it

1490
04:41:16,845 --> 04:41:23,049
that goes in my my property down here a
calico

1491
04:41:29,447 --> 04:41:30,708
yeah

1492
04:41:40,572 --> 04:41:44,628
I know nothing about this and I think
they're going to think we probably could

1493
04:41:45,319 --> 04:41:52,254
I am sure we can figure it out we could
probably write it probably script and catch
the output and then you said up what's up
with those

1494
04:41:55,828 --> 04:42:00,734
you know if we just if we just at the end of
his joints for those other things we could
actually reuse the links

1495
04:42:03,317 --> 04:42:10,550
but yeah I'm smoking so I'm constructing my
thing here to ATM

1496
04:42:14,056 --> 04:42:18,959
advertise API server

1497
04:42:20,405 --> 04:42:22,660
I cannot write

1498
04:42:28,952 --> 04:42:37,663
when to do on 68.2 too and that's specific
in our configuration

1499
04:42:38,611 --> 04:42:45,102
and we can do pod Network cidr

1500
04:42:46,427 --> 04:42:53,537
and we already know what that is right we
don't need to add that and I think we need
to add any of my just want to know what the
default are

1501
04:42:53,849 --> 04:43:11,730
I don't I don't want to do that I don't want
to confuse the issue this is only doing this
is because we have a specific IP that we've
used in them is not the default IP so that's
we need this because of agren because of
ignorant that's the primary purpose with so

1502
04:43:12,351 --> 04:43:17,871
advertise up in here Canadian

1503
04:43:23,686 --> 04:43:26,451
Annette and

1504
04:43:28,626 --> 04:43:32,315
keabadian completion Bash

1505
04:43:33,094 --> 04:43:38,694
if you ask me why I use mash as I have it
backwards into tonight

1506
04:43:40,956 --> 04:43:46,549
if you're a server I could figure that one
out but thank you

1507
04:43:50,970 --> 04:43:56,514
Pacific Union I'm doing it in but I'm also
reading a bunch of stuff

1508
04:43:57,846 --> 04:44:01,108
did the car lot of people keep medium is the
hard way

1509
04:44:02,887 --> 04:44:40,972
we just talked about how the tone of the
documentation can be very confusing to
beginners because when you when you come out
at you think the easy way is use me to give
her trying to get started or just a cloud
and they say no and then there's this other
way if you want to do a real unfriend thing
you just keep comedian to do it the easy way
and it's not easy but it's easier than doing
each individual thing like what she was
talking about and like Kelsey talk about in
his guitar. Which is extremely dated by the
way they install Q proxy binary instead of
using Q proxy as a demon set which is
evidence enough for me to never use it so

1510
04:44:40,976 --> 04:44:47,261
hey sister Dan + Shay Wikipedia Mama Texas

1511
04:44:47,533 --> 04:44:54,236
we had a pretty big debate with myself
anyway about

1512
04:44:54,402 --> 04:44:57,609
about the value of cube ATM

1513
04:44:59,325 --> 04:45:20,523
and I think that the core value of Q ATM is
bringing up. And I mean full systems for
evaluation and testing and potentially even
direction to Enterprise

1514
04:45:20,523 --> 04:45:27,937
we had some some some conversation since
you're here I'll go ahead and put it out
there it

1515
04:45:27,217 --> 04:45:29,714
it handles PreFlight checks a lot

1516
04:45:29,988 --> 04:45:42,168
I wish I could lick it in all your product
or service traffic you know she has good
news and she was talking about they don't do
that they built the whole thing from scratch
they use Rancher and

1517
04:45:42,562 --> 04:45:48,365
and it's production quality so I mentioned
one simple question

1518
04:45:49,353 --> 04:45:52,874
if your ass is a contractor employer as a c
t o

1519
04:45:53,326 --> 04:46:07,150
you you're tasked with install kubernetes
for us right and they say we have our own
Hardware we got our own machine learning
things we want to do it here and then I'm
probably pretty decided we were about to
Hardware put covid-19 down there and

1520
04:46:07,364 --> 04:46:21,837
when asked to do that for a moment I paused
at the answer the strategy being used to be
damned to do that because I know of at least
three other Enterprises clean my current
Enterprise that did not do that

1521
04:46:21,837 --> 04:46:24,836
and they have all reached the

1522
04:46:24,836 --> 04:46:34,245
you know disadvantages of that and you know
we were cuz she was down for today because
certs expired and they did at CD outside of
UVM

1523
04:46:34,344 --> 04:47:10,229
and so I'm trying to establish with the
Enterprise and you know what the interest
industry Enterprise best practice for 4
standing up a kubernetes cluster is if
number one you don't go with it with
openshift wish everybody agreed to be the
first pick for most people unfortunately at
to the first pick in probably a cloud to
solution of some kind of people in the chat
say we were stupid for even exploring the
possibility of running on front communities
and I was like you to understand the
requirements are they don't they don't
they're living in a lonely world in

1524
04:47:10,234 --> 04:47:34,722
that's that's not the world for many people
the ticket of those people doing Machinery
so open should just going to be the answer
for everybody cloud is not going to be the
answer for everybody hey how's it going
stranger us to the next question is Rancho
Rio Rancho Saturn key on Prime solution blah
blah blah and so that left me wondering
legitimately is tube ATM just

1525
04:47:34,726 --> 04:48:01,597
basically kind of me to keep on steroids for
developers to get a sense of how to develop
something or for people to develop storage
class providers in a way that is real if you
know you can't do that I'm going to give up
that easily but can we build storage cross
providers and code them and test them in a
real companies environment without the cloud
with out over to follow up just for
developers and assistant system that moves
like me to beat the shit out of something in
a controlled environment

1526
04:48:01,600 --> 04:48:23,534
or is it more than qbdm actually be used in
production in a can you stand up a
coronavirus cluster in production that has
you know Den hundred twenty-two hundred
thousand notes and expected to perform and
be able to add extra things in the answer to
that I believe is yes

1527
04:48:23,537 --> 04:48:40,295
in our particular case we just recently
added another control plane and we used to
be DM for that but then we had to tweak it
because we'd already built this external at
CD dependency and so we had to come back and
fix that particular part after we use at the
base of a ATM

1528
04:48:40,298 --> 04:48:43,653
there's a quote in a blog on keeping your
purpose

1529
04:48:44,309 --> 04:48:48,344
resigning all of our cluster that are fully
compliant

1530
04:48:48,505 --> 04:48:52,845
it's been under active development since
2016

1531
04:48:53,111 --> 04:49:01,643
is it a fact if you were a school for Dakota
pastors and I've read all that stuff

1532
04:49:01,747 --> 04:49:12,988
so it's so this is this there's no official
document to this effect when I'm trying to
get his a sense of where all these other
people coming from her doing their own
careers clusters

1533
04:49:12,990 --> 04:49:44,999
add my best because you said it's been
around since 2016 2017 right so if you
medium has been the go-to thing and then
we'll come as close to her as more compliant
yeah but I mean every time I hear people
talk about full compliance they say many
Cubans fully compliant they say kind is
fully compliant I'm like okay fine it's
fully compliant but when I speak that for an
Enterprise as hell no and it keeps ATM is
regularly being picked by people in a
production Enterprise in Ojai performance
environments

1534
04:49:45,004 --> 04:50:07,726
or is there some magic shows are coming from
a place of my desire to be able to provide
Consulting feedback to people asking
question like what's the best way you know
there's so many different ways to start a
kubernetes in your environment first
question is do you even need covered and
he's been after that you have a certified

1535
04:50:06,658 --> 04:50:08,928
you have a certified to raise District

1536
04:50:09,188 --> 04:50:16,664
I know there's Voice or if I can race
sisters are you going to run your Enterprise
Machinery cluster on Mini Cube fuk no so

1537
04:50:18,581 --> 04:50:23,600
they're fully certified as opposed to what
was the other term

1538
04:50:24,467 --> 04:50:28,026
boots see I'm reading from the docs

1539
04:50:30,964 --> 04:50:35,748
viable clusters it doesn't say
production-grade coasters

1540
04:50:41,687 --> 04:50:51,752
I mean lvg says it's a default to bootstrap
production clusters and I tend to agree that
guy went into this activity with that
assumption

1541
04:50:52,589 --> 04:50:58,174
the tops is ready I remember reading that

1542
04:50:58,983 --> 04:51:08,473
Google give me six when they become his
mistress typically need to be strong minimum
viable clusters that are fully compliant
with certified Community guidelines has been
reactive elements a $6

1543
04:51:08,789 --> 04:51:16,595
or the title of the article production-ready
Cara, Taqueria and who wrote this

1544
04:51:18,257 --> 04:51:23,217
look for consents have to go private. He was
the tool that enables Christmas tree because
we strapped

1545
04:51:27,798 --> 04:51:33,471
ia Security on the foundation I agree I'm
I'm glad this is true

1546
04:51:35,189 --> 04:51:42,981
are you a Russian letters okay so far I
don't know what are KDs

1547
04:51:44,428 --> 04:51:52,344
at least one I don't know I don't know what
that is I'm at the look that up

1548
04:51:54,001 --> 04:52:01,325
that's okay I control plane so I'll come and
then you act

1549
04:52:05,690 --> 04:52:14,913
what what I'm about to say and this is
something very yeah we got a lot of people
talking about the option right

1550
04:52:14,914 --> 04:52:19,402
right now I don't even come over Noah
companies they come over just

1551
04:52:19,402 --> 04:52:28,315
oh shit wait a second did you just say that
red hat openshift is not a certified
ronettis provider

1552
04:52:28,317 --> 04:52:36,258
cuz that's what I thought it sound like you
just said if that's true omigod am I going
to use that

1553
04:52:36,494 --> 04:52:40,563
oh okay pretty sure she say

1554
04:52:46,716 --> 04:52:53,191
and I can be there in just over

1555
04:52:53,344 --> 04:52:57,248
well yeah I mean that goes nothing

1556
04:52:58,035 --> 04:53:08,537
I mean they're trying to get locked in on
that I imagine they've done optimizations
internally for their particular destroys
their lately on PodOmatic thing like that

1557
04:53:13,459 --> 04:53:16,841
you may need a minute and she set up snot
running

1558
04:53:19,494 --> 04:53:22,575
and identified her.

1559
04:53:22,990 --> 04:53:28,550
Ever use a Mini Cooper macaronis if you
actually are you running keeping him inside
me to keep you in

1560
04:53:28,551 --> 04:53:31,097
did not know that

1561
04:53:33,051 --> 04:53:42,068
your sister I didn't realize it was already
keeping him in their sleep reproduction most
companies force you to their distro yes

1562
04:53:43,433 --> 04:53:54,883
what security is offer most accurate is
offering your Cloud give me the image of go
to for creating what causes a low level

1563
04:53:54,884 --> 04:54:00,433
at a low level interesting Rita's in a
highly customized communities

1564
04:54:01,629 --> 04:54:13,566
Beamer really did not know that it doesn't
cut it for you need to customize can raise
cluster Taylor to your Hardware security
policy excetera

1565
04:54:14,255 --> 04:54:16,932
what this one

1566
04:54:18,426 --> 04:54:28,554
is a Samara special stamp on bare metal
machines anyone to quickly create create
sculptures that are secure and in
conformance the best practices but also I
can pick him up

1567
04:54:28,555 --> 04:54:33,577
yeah that would be us give me a G

1568
04:54:33,577 --> 04:54:37,366
you can point that out

1569
04:54:37,754 --> 04:54:47,978
yeah alright well they have it as being a
stickler on this particular point because I
wanted I want to you know I need I need you
show me the money kind of thing I

1570
04:54:46,624 --> 04:55:03,901
money kind of thing I eat when I'm going to
have a conversation with somebody about why
I made a decision to do something I want to
know why and I it's kind of this noon OCT I
wish nature of my brain to think about these
questions like if someone comes to me and
have no idea what to do

1571
04:55:04,794 --> 04:55:59,670
yeah I went I have no idea what to do and
and they say why you can't go wrong with
Cube ATM we need it on Prime cluster we're
going to do a ton of custom configuration we
might even write her own you know extensions
plugins controllers excetera which all of
which could be done with no cameras but
anyway let's say they want to actually
provide their own storage class I mean
there's one right so that are working for a
company that the storage pods company and
you want to run a community's cluster in
order to test you know OptimEyes in that
storage class for Cooper Nettie's as a
fucking no-brainer that's definitely keep a
damn and that's the kind of thing I want to
do I want to write eventually I know the
long way from it but eventually I want to
write software and go for kubernetes for
Hardware providers and vendors and other
people like that and import their job at
your back in to go or something like that
that's what I want to do in and there's no
doubt that many cubes are where to go for
them

1572
04:55:59,678 --> 04:56:11,561
knowing that many Cube already uses to ATM
even more justification and I'm going to say
something so controversial anybody who is
not using Cube ATM

1573
04:56:11,947 --> 04:56:18,070
I would say that you are the outlier and
frankly I think you have some technical debt

1574
04:56:19,894 --> 04:56:24,147
I said that there now yell at me yell at me
for saying that

1575
04:56:24,627 --> 04:56:29,231
if you if you're running a community's close
to her and you are not running

1576
04:56:29,922 --> 04:56:39,591
from something has been built like a medium
having had it been around for so long you
have to have like a really significant
reason to do that and if you don't

1577
04:56:40,456 --> 04:56:52,409
somebody said that it makes it hard to
upgrade well how was it less hard to upgrade
all of your individual pieces especially
when you're searching on their own you know
expiration track

1578
04:56:53,671 --> 04:57:00,467
she never yes I remember this is true I'm
pretty sure it 25 knows that person
personally

1579
04:57:03,153 --> 04:57:09,552
based on the track record of name dropping
so

1580
04:57:09,552 --> 04:57:15,854
it's okay baby I'm sorry Jessica celenza
continue be committed

1581
04:57:17,780 --> 04:57:25,358
I'm going to say it again if you're not
using yeah I had a feeling

1582
04:57:25,492 --> 04:57:33,420
if you're not using yeah Tony Tony fuzz

1583
04:57:33,620 --> 04:57:44,483
a pretty well connected with his put it out
I can't say who will you probably know who
Tony for his just from another way we're not
going to talk Sunday but nobody talks to me
for

1584
04:57:44,483 --> 04:57:51,119
nobody knocks 95 you know Tony from but but
tell me photos everybody

1585
04:57:52,428 --> 04:57:58,536
at that level so so yeah

1586
04:57:59,037 --> 04:58:02,979
I'm going to say something and I know it's
controversial

1587
04:58:02,980 --> 04:58:12,038
let me say it again because I believe it now
I've done enough research in a preliminary
research I will need to change my opinion if
I can do information but as of this moment

1588
04:58:12,040 --> 04:58:20,926
if you are running a kubernetes cluster this
not been administered and installed using Q
ATM you have technical debt

1589
04:58:21,656 --> 04:58:24,980
and probably unnecessarily so

1590
04:58:26,838 --> 04:58:40,996
yeah I know that you know kubernetes is not
perfect and it's got bugs out there and you
got to do your own thing sometimes you get
around the bug I mean that's already been a
thing right but the chances are if you're if
you're unless you're you're using a managed
communities

1591
04:58:41,333 --> 04:58:47,077
are you talking about like a cloud provider
something like Rancher or opinion

1592
04:58:48,817 --> 04:59:05,472
actually if you are home crafting you're
keeping it is Custer and installing all the
pieces like you would if you were to go
through Kelsey Hightower so you know from
scratch money and you think you're cooler
because you did it that way I'm going to go
so far as to say you are a bad person

1593
04:59:05,654 --> 04:59:23,761
because you just you just added a ton of
fucking complexity and independent upgrade
tracks that have to be maintained outside of
the supported nothing which is supported by
the foundation

1594
04:59:23,763 --> 04:59:28,060
and yeah your service man were to
guessTopsail

1595
04:59:30,352 --> 04:59:35,816
anaconda versus last year lyrics to the
Federal

1596
04:59:36,982 --> 04:59:44,721
ask me where Enterprise when did this happen
are you okay baby sounds

1597
04:59:45,777 --> 04:59:54,413
where is a place that I would work it so the
place that I would definitely work I want to
work some places writing software for
keeping ID so that's that's the thing I want
to do

1598
04:59:55,627 --> 05:00:08,807
Iris registry see there you go if you need
any other for the harbor is a thing to learn
we're going to learn how to write next I
can't I got to go I got to hurry cuz I got
shit to do all right so I am going to make a
conclusion here

1599
05:00:11,621 --> 05:00:15,860
what is Upstream kunai's Isabella point of
what this word nice

1600
05:00:30,962 --> 05:01:12,619
yeah how's that for controversial God knows
I'm kind of a big apology and there is like
I apologize for my opinions and if there
might be a penny is in here and my opinions
I don't represent a little bit because
because it's it's it's definitely necessary
to write like that given the number of
contacts Downey Phi has with significant
people in the air Bruno Indiana like the
desire to not take too many breaks him he'll
make too many like boiling water and that's
what I meant

1601
05:01:13,235 --> 05:01:19,205
I like your music Amy on you suck you
shouldn't be doing that stop doing it
everyone's like

1602
05:01:20,539 --> 05:01:26,670
yeah vedette

1603
05:01:28,434 --> 05:01:34,557
no Cube ATM? You're probably doing it wrong

1604
05:01:39,407 --> 05:01:42,663
I'm going to be my own. It's true

1605
05:01:42,663 --> 05:01:52,843
how many times have I have it in my notes
that I don't believe anymore I'm glad you
put that tell me what I need to put mine
it's like I'm going to do that

1606
05:01:53,796 --> 05:02:01,421
I went to right now while I'm thinking of it
I knew it because Isis as ever

1607
05:02:01,421 --> 05:02:27,285
and I went off on people and as is available
so they're pretty much a topic like running
about with me public Republic first such as
soon as the spelling right ready. There were
six and realization that was wrong because
it was meant to be an organic place to jump
thoughts not a fan of complication please

1608
05:02:27,704 --> 05:02:35,101
please consult with me on any specific topic
before

1609
05:02:35,101 --> 05:02:37,514
I'm going to put it in the morning here

1610
05:02:43,260 --> 05:02:50,251
yeah yeah I know I mean I said I don't care
about

1611
05:03:40,340 --> 05:03:46,125
he really sad it was a good independent
project oh God

1612
05:03:49,291 --> 05:03:57,104
bye no you don't do parodies

1613
05:03:59,627 --> 05:04:07,986
now when I say that when I'm not trying to
be too argumentative they're fighting here
but I imagine that there are a ton of
companies that into play Cuban Eddie's

1614
05:04:06,561 --> 05:04:19,861
is it at the play Cooper Nettie's well
before cuckoo baby in was reliable and I
can't judge them I mean they have to keep
track of it trying to redeploy your entire
kubernetes cluster is massive techno dad

1615
05:04:21,089 --> 05:05:02,989
it does make me curious to know what comes
next though and I haven't even hit that yet
I'm just a noob I haven't even hit what
happens when you have to upgrade you know
12000 High Performance Machine learning
nodes and you want to go back to using a
cube ATM install the only way to do that is
to drain all the nodes and reset them with a
brand new cluster or the upgrade of a
cluster in this slowly migrated nose up
which allows you to do you can like take a
certain number of nose off and and dedicate
them to a new cluster and then get everybody
to move over to the new cluster but that's a
massive massive effort

1616
05:05:02,995 --> 05:05:08,261
yeah I mean so I could see them not wanting
to pay for that now

1617
05:05:08,368 --> 05:05:14,280
is thinking of your own web so intense but
isn't that kind of interlocking yeah

1618
05:05:14,368 --> 05:05:18,963
I'll let you know something more people
about this or stuff yeah

1619
05:05:19,623 --> 05:05:37,816
yeah nnnnn you know if you're if you're the
one left holding the bag vendor lock-in and
using qadim could be considered a form of
vendor lock-in right so I want if I don't
want to just give it to him cuz it sucks it
does the same thing over here not very well
and mother what and you be in trouble

1620
05:06:13,963 --> 05:06:16,174
you know exactly what it is

1621
05:06:20,082 --> 05:06:23,350
to the latest flavor of the week yes

1622
05:06:24,201 --> 05:06:35,793
well that's not that's that's just a whole
tackle that problem you know I mean that
applies to everything I'm texting on the
tagged in a technical round. Right there's
just people

1623
05:07:54,619 --> 05:07:57,279
but it's doable

1624
05:08:52,758 --> 05:08:54,742
do do do do

1625
05:09:27,006 --> 05:09:28,689
alright so

1626
05:09:36,189 --> 05:09:42,960
if strong opinions are welcome here as usual

1627
05:09:46,778 --> 05:09:58,872
I had to repeat that again was here and I
want to run up a large Enterprise all the
time and that's why I had to ask question

1628
05:10:01,765 --> 05:10:07,800
and it API server advertise

1629
05:10:08,802 --> 05:10:15,237
what is it sir

1630
05:10:16,004 --> 05:10:21,007
API advertise server API API server
advertise server

1631
05:10:21,823 --> 05:10:24,720
that seems like a bad name Joyce

1632
05:10:28,323 --> 05:10:34,770
it's so easy yes yeah

1633
05:10:36,217 --> 05:10:45,770
it's a dress advertise address so I wrote it
I'm the one who fuk up okay here we go
address

1634
05:10:47,431 --> 05:10:52,234
I feel much better the world is my reality
is saying no

1635
05:10:52,582 --> 05:11:00,038
all right so 192.168. 2.83 to

1636
05:11:03,596 --> 05:11:09,262
search available it's not empty that's
because we already did it

1637
05:11:15,362 --> 05:11:18,292
yes OS right I can do it from here right

1638
05:11:19,524 --> 05:11:24,041
I for I forgot about reset I got it I got to
get used to this

1639
05:11:26,325 --> 05:11:33,816
and at the firewalls are still stopped us
from working but let's just say it was get
the IP right first and then we'll do the
next thing

1640
05:11:39,235 --> 05:11:44,568
and I'm saying no I'm saying it so we need
to join here for soon

1641
05:11:51,793 --> 05:11:55,770
here's the thing where I can do this again
you said w

1642
05:12:01,628 --> 05:12:08,820
can you join discovered token hash

1643
05:12:10,974 --> 05:12:18,015
get to the 5 it's typing it in this one too

1644
05:12:19,122 --> 05:12:26,970
I don't know how to work I didn't shed as
she'd work it should be able to join itself
and shouldn't be in there

1645
05:12:28,502 --> 05:12:35,809
and should not be in here it should be fine
but it's funny I mean

1646
05:12:36,554 --> 05:12:41,898
Stephanie oh wait baby to change it change
the IP number that's nice

1647
05:12:44,296 --> 05:12:51,552
I'm jealous. That's probably cuz you can't
talk to the network oh

1648
05:12:52,015 --> 05:12:59,631
it's I didn't either firewall up do we turn
it off

1649
05:13:03,994 --> 05:13:08,462
show me I didn't turn it off tell me I
didn't turn it off

1650
05:13:09,645 --> 05:13:16,257
do we do we turn off I don't think we turn
the fire off are we did

1651
05:13:17,690 --> 05:13:22,007
we did we did cell

1652
05:13:23,151 --> 05:13:30,518
but that's pretty cool I mean it it works I
got to knownow they can't talk to each other
cuz it have a network

1653
05:13:30,984 --> 05:13:35,647
nope I will show that I will demonstrate
this presently

1654
05:13:48,399 --> 05:13:55,445
so so now what well let's try some things

1655
05:13:55,789 --> 05:13:58,722
first of all cubes ETL

1656
05:13:58,805 --> 05:14:04,437
went to your ex were right ask for it this
is something new Cube config

1657
05:14:05,396 --> 05:14:10,380
Eagles Etsy kubernetes

1658
05:14:13,090 --> 05:14:19,978
admin now there is no admin on the other one
so they're going to fail

1659
05:14:21,782 --> 05:14:27,022
off the firewall Mendoza cousin trouble
you're as soon as the other connect think
about nuts

1660
05:14:27,988 --> 05:14:33,326
text logs right to health checks yeah yeah
I'm not too familiar with that stuff

1661
05:14:34,330 --> 05:14:40,764
let's make a note to turn the power off on
everything

1662
05:14:41,465 --> 05:14:44,449
at we obviously need it

1663
05:14:53,214 --> 05:14:55,718
disable firewall on everything

1664
05:15:01,222 --> 05:15:04,748
I have teddy bear this whole system
paintings and give me in trouble

1665
05:15:06,741 --> 05:15:11,833
it is going to give me trouble codes in a
pain and just call today

1666
05:15:16,309 --> 05:15:19,169
yeah I think here

1667
05:15:20,056 --> 05:15:32,164
and they don't know about like me like I
don't know what this is super dangerous but
fun but I want to just show with it so it
doesn't work right

1668
05:15:32,526 --> 05:15:36,851
keep CDL can nodes

1669
05:15:37,141 --> 05:15:44,622
so hey look we have nose and they are doing
their thing alright so

1670
05:15:45,394 --> 05:15:55,679
yep they did as far as and Calico and all
that and you will see that they are not
there

1671
05:15:56,075 --> 05:15:59,829
get Hans

1672
05:16:05,803 --> 05:16:16,253
and there we go so we have the accordion s
pods which are needed to ease need to talk
to

1673
05:16:16,490 --> 05:16:18,376
in points

1674
05:16:18,376 --> 05:16:28,197
actually scored in his faults are running on
invoice I think they're cute system there in
the juices and mrs. I think they're damaged
fence that run I think that's I think they
are

1675
05:16:28,767 --> 05:16:38,970
I'm pretty sure they're damn assistant run
at 14 pod I mean 14 node over known yeah so
let's get

1676
05:16:39,587 --> 05:16:44,238
I need to turn this off when I break
something

1677
05:16:48,203 --> 05:16:55,845
stress pains it's a fine with your ugly
sweater felt so

1678
05:17:05,926 --> 05:17:10,766
so that means it's not an it's not a it's
not a Davidson

1679
05:17:15,849 --> 05:17:20,472
Gibson she'll get appointment

1680
05:17:21,442 --> 05:17:27,809
that shade appointment find get Dash

1681
05:17:29,802 --> 05:17:35,745
qct L contacts

1682
05:17:40,199 --> 05:17:47,128
set second text

1683
05:17:49,190 --> 05:17:55,541
Dash namespace Hue system

1684
05:18:04,235 --> 05:18:11,172
how config I can my commands are getting
rusty god dammit

1685
05:18:29,266 --> 05:18:34,373
it ain't my music current images of stashed
current

1686
05:18:38,014 --> 05:18:41,643
I used to remember this shit is like one of
my favorite commands

1687
05:18:58,844 --> 05:19:05,744
I feel so embarrassed I can't remember it
it's can fix it contacting space current

1688
05:19:06,461 --> 05:19:09,402
no it's set namespace

1689
05:19:12,081 --> 05:19:17,491
and then it's his face something along those
lines

1690
05:19:21,937 --> 05:19:29,554
isn't contacts containment

1691
05:19:31,195 --> 05:19:33,375
I mean this is stuff I have to

1692
05:19:38,085 --> 05:19:44,961
I don't want it again thing I don't like
doing that I want to do it this way so there

1693
05:19:53,287 --> 05:19:57,075
I actually don't think it's a command

1694
05:19:57,111 --> 05:20:04,934
that's the problem yeah okay I did it right
eye current

1695
05:20:06,092 --> 05:20:07,933
s n

1696
05:20:12,299 --> 05:20:19,080
and I fucking righted yay

1697
05:20:22,151 --> 05:20:41,609
that I do not I do not fucking thing filed
very often I probably need to start I do not
know much about the about the Aqib config
file format I haven't spent a lot of time in
there I've just been you know using the
stuff

1698
05:20:41,652 --> 05:20:44,819
get say config

1699
05:21:01,195 --> 05:21:08,549
there you go anything about five names yeah

1700
05:21:09,347 --> 05:21:10,872
yep

1701
05:21:11,637 --> 05:21:18,309
department has said yeah but David said that
extra think of the name to

1702
05:21:20,788 --> 05:21:24,903
yeah I could have swore they do

1703
05:21:25,173 --> 05:21:31,698
I know it's right let's do kjq proxy that is
named except for sure god dammit

1704
05:21:36,290 --> 05:21:37,964
fuck

1705
05:21:44,857 --> 05:21:49,353
get Damon said

1706
05:21:49,557 --> 05:21:52,879
keep on saying I guess I'll run

1707
05:21:56,793 --> 05:22:03,918
that makes sense because it's a replica said
in so I can be tricky tray renewed you don't
even a damn if they all got one guaranteed

1708
05:22:04,543 --> 05:22:21,721
right at that makes sense yeah the only
reason I said pods have that is because they
can get reap any time there are super
ephemeral and the button the other Damon
said stuff they possess to write and it's
like actually no Staples hits

1709
05:22:21,723 --> 05:22:38,190
I think save us is going to have replicas as
well write anything that can ever happen
this has it has the actual name on it that's
something I kind of picked up along the way
but but can be a pain in the ass to look
into pods directly which normally probably
shouldn't do it

1710
05:22:38,191 --> 05:22:44,519
anyway so yeah what are we doing what I say

1711
05:22:47,824 --> 05:22:53,397
something17 x 23 is it really that's even
better

1712
05:22:54,009 --> 05:22:58,690
so that's what I'm going to share until you
to be with me tonight that is super cool

1713
05:22:59,436 --> 05:23:06,744
that I got to get into stable says I really
do I can't wait to get into them they they
can do so many cool things

1714
05:23:07,120 --> 05:23:11,261
I think Stay full sets are going to be one
of the best

1715
05:23:11,697 --> 05:23:16,733
tools for kubernetes administrators to use

1716
05:23:19,001 --> 05:23:24,684
because by creating a statefulset you can
cash your own shit

1717
05:23:25,122 --> 05:23:34,513
and keep track of stuff in the Clusters
basically you can add ad hoc observability
scripts and shit to a stateful set

1718
05:23:35,677 --> 05:23:38,063
and yeah and then

1719
05:23:39,623 --> 05:23:46,258
and then you can put that send that off to
where we want to and you have guarantee
persistence

1720
05:23:48,567 --> 05:24:07,469
I like him a lot I like him a lot in effect
when I first learned about BBC I was like
this is useless to me and then I thought
about Staples that sounds like what it's
guaranteed always get the same storage
holyshit why wasn't that include in the
rainforest I don't know why people are not
using Staples this for everything

1721
05:24:08,502 --> 05:24:11,547
I forgot to get ready before starting next
body up

1722
05:24:11,711 --> 05:24:18,178
it gets really valuable I really do think
it's awesome and right so

1723
05:24:21,039 --> 05:24:27,830
yep it's okay get Akshay

1724
05:24:29,832 --> 05:24:36,345
where you got everything here so here mostly
I want to see what they are

1725
05:24:37,731 --> 05:24:41,346
I can't get pod there cuz right there when
it is

1726
05:24:50,001 --> 05:24:52,612
so this is a pod

1727
05:24:57,711 --> 05:25:04,036
I was given a zap and I can be an ass wenis

1728
05:25:04,999 --> 05:25:12,790
77 scorpion this is just a service it's not
it's not a and it is not a pronoun again
thing

1729
05:25:13,081 --> 05:25:30,521
it's to keep Roxie that's doing and it's
doing the DNS riding when they do dinner so
I can swing by originally understood it to
work and then I kind of I kind of I kind of
Switched after that kind of changed

1730
05:25:33,513 --> 05:25:41,960
does a chi chi like wait what is there any
recording in this instance on every pod on
every and that didn't make any of your node

1731
05:25:44,052 --> 05:25:46,281
they don't write

1732
05:25:47,200 --> 05:25:59,759
there's no there's no accordion s instance
running within a node in order to in order
to handle the genius queries that then the
proxies brokering them all up to some
Central

1733
05:25:59,890 --> 05:26:06,921
SubCentral DNS

1734
05:26:06,921 --> 05:26:10,739
it ain't safe assets yet so

1735
05:26:10,739 --> 05:26:15,891
Cornelius Cornelius in case you're wondering
Cornelius was not

1736
05:26:15,895 --> 05:26:38,540
apart of kubernetes it was not a standard
part of communities has been kind of brought
in you can replace it with another piece and
CD and core DNS have been so melded with the
ATM deployment that they have become so does
synonymous with communities because they're
just there

1737
05:26:38,543 --> 05:27:07,299
and obviously can replace it with something
else you do with anything I can read his
butt but you kind of have to know it's a
part of it it's it's frustrating because
there's there's communities and then there's
all the shit that communities uses by
default and you have to come and assess how
you know permanent is this thing is just a
thing that's going to be around for a while
or is it just temporary or is it built into
the standard and bottle that says it's
really hard that's what the whole Landscapes
about so

1738
05:27:07,586 --> 05:27:10,522
so yeah so this

1739
05:27:10,522 --> 05:27:27,168
I'm on it says the replica said so that
means that there are two Cordina servers
running inside of the entire fucking cluster
and they have to talk to the pods and right
now they can't talk to the paws that's why
we looked at them they are

1740
05:27:27,292 --> 05:27:32,102
they arethey are not ready because there's
no networking

1741
05:27:32,508 --> 05:27:49,250
are cluster is configured everything it just
doesn't have any a king so none of our pods
can talk to each other and including the DNS
pods so there's things out there doing DNS
queries and stuff and they will fail because
I have no way to talk to the Dana spots

1742
05:27:50,728 --> 05:27:53,214
it doesn't definitely ready yet

1743
05:27:55,317 --> 05:28:00,152
the note the Buns on the note or not oh no
they're not ready

1744
05:28:00,982 --> 05:28:07,896
and I think they're not ready because they
don't have this you know I installed how's
it going

1745
05:28:11,803 --> 05:28:19,474
yeah I know I'm just I already did this once
and I'm doing it again because I really want
to see the state of a cluster that's broken

1746
05:28:19,684 --> 05:28:27,475
back of this ability how's it going that's
cool

1747
05:28:28,667 --> 05:28:31,912
I hope you can help you achieve your goals

1748
05:28:35,486 --> 05:28:47,416
dinner should be ready minnows are not ready
because of some other reason right I think
it's because there's no networking honestly
I do not know wait we had him join they join
to find so I don't know

1749
05:28:48,430 --> 05:28:50,248
oh wait wait wait

1750
05:28:52,948 --> 05:28:56,876
yeah I don't know

1751
05:29:00,409 --> 05:29:06,956
any Calico I think it needs Calico because
it knows you're not ready because they don't
turn on the network

1752
05:29:06,980 --> 05:29:13,924
right the reason that everything is so
unhappy it because there's no network

1753
05:29:14,184 --> 05:29:18,279
anywaywell G mastrov

1754
05:29:19,114 --> 05:29:33,702
how do I add a network are you telling me
kubernetes comes is so batteries not
included it doesn't even come with a fucking
network-layer and the answer is yes there is
no network layer by default

1755
05:29:34,566 --> 05:29:41,643
no. This is not like Docker kubernetes uses
docker Ishq containers

1756
05:29:43,710 --> 05:29:46,386
the committee's is for orchestrating
containers

1757
05:29:46,849 --> 05:30:04,902
and doing things with them at a scale at
large hail and very complicated or something
cuz that's what if if you don't know
anything about this whole topic and you just
want to get into it from the get-go I will
be beginning on February 12th to do a
containers in kubernetes beginner boost

1758
05:30:04,905 --> 05:30:08,638
and I'm going to be recapping

1759
05:30:10,704 --> 05:30:13,420
I need to be re camping

1760
05:30:13,936 --> 05:30:29,262
everything I learned about containers and
Kira days I am absolutely had to get her on
this front but that I will be recapping
everything I've learned about container
Securities in in the six weeks we have next
week are you still have a lot more time for
it

1761
05:30:29,264 --> 05:30:59,669
so if that we're going to go through why
didn't why if she's containers were they for
I should warn you though that this content
assumes that you've you've been through the
beginner boost and that you know a single
again amount about infrastructure
engineering as well we're going to doing
things that you may not understand if you
don't know of a corn is and stuff like that
and that stuff is covered elsewhere and
that's because we need to get back on
schedule so the annual cycle

1762
05:30:59,672 --> 05:31:37,462
I don't think I'm going to get her any more
reports not ready unless there's a working
at work yes so this is where we start
everybody starts at Ground Zero I make no
assumptions whatsoever other than that you
can use a computer basically and then we do
infrastructure engineering boost and then
containers communities and that is going to
be your annual cycle going forward unless I
make a change which I always do but that is
that is the anticipated schedule cuz I want
to sleep in

1763
05:31:37,466 --> 05:31:39,207
on the weekends

1764
05:31:39,207 --> 05:31:47,520
I just realized my license is going to need
some more importantly I want to stay up late

1765
05:31:47,520 --> 05:31:55,077
hi are you doing things to do in tools to do
well that's what the boosters for

1766
05:31:55,077 --> 05:32:00,481
yeah I was just driving home so

1767
05:32:01,502 --> 05:32:07,664
before I do this let me know I'm at this
place

1768
05:32:10,120 --> 05:32:15,281
if you want to know what to get started go
install virtualbox and then install Linux

1769
05:32:15,968 --> 05:32:18,415
play around with that that's your homework

1770
05:32:20,998 --> 05:32:56,610
all right give her a boost so there's my
recommendation how to get started keep in
mind that my stuff is for significant jobs
in the back and called native the security
space and not so much in the web development
space developers I tease him all the time
but I was 14 years I was Nikes with Messer
and

1771
05:32:56,865 --> 05:33:17,818
my stuff is primarily related to security,
native Enterprise infrastructure operations
Administration you know the stuff that makes
double the money of web developers usually
and is also a fundamental part of the back
end part of a full stack engineer I have to
say that every time I push the Boost

1772
05:33:18,691 --> 05:33:24,734
it is likely to still keep any reset doesn't
keep going to be tonight it was a clean
install them

1773
05:33:25,170 --> 05:33:29,547
I've been in my said I had to rudinos after
joining me but forgot to clean

1774
05:33:29,588 --> 05:33:55,639
I thought he it doesn't remove my default.
The clothes I had that exact problem I had
that exact problem I did it I had it I think
I install Calico and then I did a reset and
it still said they were ready and it was
fucked up and I still had to redo it because
it showed ready even though it wasn't ready
because that stuff left in that Dottie I had
that exact thing happened last week so

1775
05:33:55,642 --> 05:33:59,837
yeah this is this is going from

1776
05:34:04,422 --> 05:34:07,954
all right so what do we got

1777
05:34:11,519 --> 05:34:13,184
Etsy

1778
05:34:14,787 --> 05:34:21,953
we did a reset but we do have calicos told
so that's the next thing we have to do

1779
05:34:23,168 --> 05:34:28,410
do we have to use the mind probe on the
Netflix like we did right we didn't get away
from the

1780
05:34:28,412 --> 05:34:32,923
Armin X reloaded one and stuck with it after
reset it could have been

1781
05:34:33,176 --> 05:34:42,781
yeah I know the reason to do this was a
virtual machine right now and you didn't.
You no longer exist

1782
05:34:46,501 --> 05:34:51,041
Emma love it more proviene these days
because of all the flexibility gives you

1783
05:34:51,670 --> 05:34:58,829
comedian started that oh yeah yeah we need
to Falco

1784
05:34:59,346 --> 05:35:05,451
she said she'll yeah

1785
05:35:05,451 --> 05:35:09,416
let's do it now

1786
05:35:09,569 --> 05:35:15,409
Calico doesn't need to be installed
everywhere because it's Securities
appointment

1787
05:35:15,410 --> 05:35:17,719
text Lee Davidson

1788
05:35:17,822 --> 05:35:24,580
is it a C or D as in David said crd can be a
whole bunch of things right

1789
05:35:24,582 --> 05:35:29,454
and I'm going to find out holyshit

1790
05:35:31,316 --> 05:35:33,765
Transylvania key

1791
05:35:33,765 --> 05:35:44,224
kjet Dashay all more and we'll look at all
the Calico stuff it just got out of bed so
calicos a table set

1792
05:35:44,224 --> 05:35:51,257
Calico notice the name is at Dario that's
interesting though why is it have names
after it

1793
05:35:51,257 --> 05:36:04,243
iPod it must be also pod yeah the controller
that's it okay that makes sense as a
controller that's a pod and there's a pod
right there at it looks like it's in a
container though

1794
05:36:04,246 --> 05:36:09,161
that might go away I think this is a this is
just ridiculous ation

1795
05:36:09,526 --> 05:36:16,763
yeah if it's a damn it said that's going to
go away right after it is so this is a nib
container

1796
05:36:16,763 --> 05:36:22,344
isn't it pod but yet another thing to
explain to people

1797
05:36:22,344 --> 05:36:31,392
yeah it's a saying Calico node is
initializing and to do that is running a pod
right now these will go away the next time
you run it

1798
05:36:31,394 --> 05:36:33,898
yeah this is really good info

1799
05:36:36,582 --> 05:36:40,308
A123

1800
05:36:40,520 --> 05:36:47,941
running communities Damon sets cluster IP
keep system

1801
05:36:46,712 --> 05:36:48,939
keep system service

1802
05:36:49,452 --> 05:36:54,855
1096 West because Services Route 296 I have
that memorized now thank God

1803
05:36:59,869 --> 05:37:04,257
pods contain in a container I think that's
what I said

1804
05:37:05,803 --> 05:37:07,891
any containers in separate pots

1805
05:37:10,512 --> 05:37:16,600
how many containers are inside of the Pod
right sandwich finalized containers right

1806
05:37:16,879 --> 05:37:24,589
I remember now yep okay yeah running

1807
05:37:25,175 --> 05:37:29,838
I apparently there's a pot that goes with it
I wasn't expecting that

1808
05:37:33,122 --> 05:37:40,579
is it California to pod in addition to the
damage said it seems odd to me

1809
05:37:42,800 --> 05:37:53,692
oh I don't know I don't know how good it out
I was deployed this stuff if you're new to
communities that we have think this was the
first thing we have to go through is what
are all the resources

1810
05:37:54,598 --> 05:38:00,486
it's big is a big deal ignore cremated
instead

1811
05:38:00,787 --> 05:38:03,165
I will deposit created by the demon said

1812
05:38:03,945 --> 05:38:11,883
oh that's right every Damon said his
replicas come on Rob yeah that's right I'm
sorry yes I forgot

1813
05:38:12,000 --> 05:38:19,190
all right it's it's more than just a replica
said right duh

1814
05:38:21,170 --> 05:38:22,702
yeah

1815
05:38:24,163 --> 05:38:29,269
yes they're credit of course they are I got
confused

1816
05:38:29,521 --> 05:38:32,924
what else is new

1817
05:38:33,856 --> 05:38:41,067
yeah that the whole replication thing is it
is is easy to get wrong position of coconut
on the notes

1818
05:38:42,618 --> 05:38:59,103
firewall or something we didn't reset
anything over there so I also didn't do it
be our Network bridges on everything I don't
think I did that on everything I had Mike my
best is probably iptables stuff is not on
everything right I think I want to read some
of that stuff on the controller

1819
05:38:59,961 --> 05:39:02,487
there's no network configured again

1820
05:39:03,330 --> 05:39:09,450
yeah yeah yeah I am with you on that I think
it's probably right

1821
05:39:09,618 --> 05:39:13,450
I don't even know how to check that though
we're going to have to

1822
05:39:14,200 --> 05:39:18,630
yeah I was fix it I'm trying to fix it now

1823
05:39:20,970 --> 05:39:28,053
we have our laws are off iptables rules are
on their participation table things

1824
05:39:28,165 --> 05:39:35,742
does got loaded and everything and the
module with the Montrose stuff might not be
there

1825
05:39:35,743 --> 05:39:42,308
the Orlando and then Brer netfilter how do
you know let's go check

1826
05:39:42,308 --> 05:39:48,493
is Ellis Marcella thing answer

1827
05:39:49,896 --> 05:39:56,905
the NFL is there chose the wrong and network
interface to talk to the other notes

1828
05:40:00,282 --> 05:40:06,989
what describe yes at

1829
05:40:09,133 --> 05:40:15,748
logs Calico node

1830
05:40:15,748 --> 05:40:18,473
hey how's it going welcome

1831
05:40:21,020 --> 05:40:25,008
yep I'm already in keep system but it's also

1832
05:40:27,084 --> 05:40:30,474
that's something I actually know how to do

1833
05:40:32,517 --> 05:40:39,818
if so identify reconciliation lives over in
blah

1834
05:40:39,819 --> 05:40:43,629
I did before it did it in front of solution
lips

1835
05:40:45,660 --> 05:40:52,280
is this is this control oh it is a control

1836
05:40:57,385 --> 05:41:04,678
oh it's one of these is busted let's go look
at one of these hey there

1837
05:41:04,678 --> 05:41:08,532
well where are these Bots coming from

1838
05:41:08,532 --> 05:41:12,956
are these Bots is our Bots are they not

1839
05:41:12,957 --> 05:41:20,005
I did not make these Bots to do this what
the hell people

1840
05:41:20,112 --> 05:41:27,684
oh my God how am I going to stop this as you

but I don't like having fake followers cuz
then people give me shit I had I had a

few hours I know

1851
05:43:04,498 --> 05:43:12,199
I might just have to turn it off I don't
know how to even turn it off

1852
05:43:12,961 --> 05:43:19,491
oh God here we go we know you watch child
pronography

1853
05:43:20,638 --> 05:43:32,334
it's not my Ivy please don't go look at the
IP iTunes pornography

1854
05:43:32,335 --> 05:43:36,176
I did have sex with my wife this morning

like to give me the look

1856
05:43:47,426 --> 05:43:55,096
I know too much information oh shit I don't

1857
05:43:55,293 --> 05:44:01,806
I'm sorry I just had to make a joke the bad
joke

1858
05:44:03,099 --> 05:44:08,692
I just have to feel Kentucky I don't want to
look at it. Please look at the IP

1859
05:44:10,481 --> 05:44:18,553
this is the thing we're supposed to turn off
being able to push it into the spam you know
unless they do a thing

1860
05:44:20,181 --> 05:44:21,795
yeah

1861
05:44:23,299 --> 05:44:31,008
don't post the clip and just go to I don't
know how to save this save us from this

1862
05:44:31,686 --> 05:44:34,327
I don't know

1863
05:44:36,434 --> 05:44:43,507
should I just stop streaming and that would
they would win if we did that

1864
05:44:44,284 --> 05:44:47,578
b

1865
05:44:57,263 --> 05:45:04,104
disable phone applications yeah that's the
first thing to do are you at right now

1866
05:45:04,105 --> 05:45:12,642
it is if I wanted to spend my time doing
this instead of helping people in
communities cuz cuz apparently people don't
want me to do that

1867
05:45:13,089 --> 05:45:19,853
no they don't want me to be successful and
help people they want they want to rip his
down

1868
05:45:25,686 --> 05:45:33,630
yeah I don't know 50th birthday

1869
05:45:36,094 --> 05:45:45,673
stopping stream unless you're uncomfortable
afraid something bad is going to happen on
the stream and I don't want it to get banned

1870
05:45:45,673 --> 05:45:52,535
cuz people have been banned for having shit
happened on their stream that's not not
within their control

1871
05:45:53,802 --> 05:46:00,897
and that's all hey look I got a whole 105
followers today

1872
05:46:03,600 --> 05:46:09,294

alert box is getting turned off filter
events

1874
05:46:20,525 --> 05:46:26,267
test for excessive follow Shelly hey look I
just followed myself

1875
05:46:31,733 --> 05:46:33,911
all right I promise to stop

1876
05:46:34,643 --> 05:46:41,633
unlimited alert moderation delay unless if
your navel all alerts need to be approved
manually

1877
05:46:44,259 --> 05:46:46,088
if I see that

1878
05:46:47,859 --> 05:46:56,317
sensory cinnamon sensors are recent events
for streamer unless I clicked on if
moderator proves it is uncensor for streamer

1879
05:47:02,513 --> 05:47:09,087
I didn't do it disabled

1880
05:47:09,957 --> 05:47:12,784
learn moderation to alert delay

1881
05:47:17,043 --> 05:47:23,197
I do I turn off I'm trying reset stream
label session automatically

1882
05:47:24,683 --> 05:47:32,197
maybe stressful energy extraction and carry
on as you were otherwise I do need to turn
off all the follows though

1883
05:47:32,876 --> 05:47:34,304
and I mean

1884
05:47:42,981 --> 05:47:48,982
you know what that's probably a way to do it
well that would be way too easy

1885
05:47:51,423 --> 05:47:59,109
oh my God that's like the easiest of all now
I still saying it can you hear it

1886
05:48:06,483 --> 05:48:08,373
mute it on the mixer

1887
05:48:13,702 --> 05:48:19,176
you can't because it's just stuff out but I
don't mean to do that I have to turn the
sound off completely

1888
05:48:26,894 --> 05:48:30,068
you can't hear it now right you can just
hear me but no sound

1889
05:48:37,345 --> 05:48:41,096
recent stream labels alert Perry

1890
05:48:41,987 --> 05:48:49,337
bad words that so when I didn't push them
settings you can't hear right now right

1891
05:48:53,071 --> 05:48:56,315
yeah it's been a slow music and only try
something else

1892
05:48:57,868 --> 05:49:04,411
unlimited alert moderation delay this
applies to all ours and enable all ours need
to be approved manually

1893
05:49:08,178 --> 05:49:14,713
save setting I'm going to try something that
should have stopped it

1894
05:49:16,067 --> 05:49:17,912
apparently not

1895
05:49:23,843 --> 05:49:30,971
no that's supposed to make it so that all
alerts are enabled to be for a manually it
doesn't work

1896
05:49:33,113 --> 05:49:39,668
is there all recent events forestry mower
unless clicked on

1897
05:49:45,013 --> 05:49:55,530
it doesn't give you the false thing cuz it
doesn't give you any sound

1898
05:49:55,904 --> 05:49:58,344
if I hear it still

1899
05:50:01,589 --> 05:50:05,862
I mean yeah let's just take it off of it

1900
05:50:07,176 --> 05:50:13,701
I mean this is this is by far the easiest
way to keep track of this with the sound
annoyance for y'all

1901
05:50:17,179 --> 05:50:22,339
and I mean but

1902
05:50:22,465 --> 05:50:28,479
as he hears me I'll do mine if

1903
05:50:30,333 --> 05:50:33,849
follows itsy

1904
05:50:33,852 --> 05:50:39,465
oh wait you can turn them all off disabled
wait wait wait

1905
05:50:39,466 --> 05:50:42,620
I think they've already been queued

1906
05:50:49,707 --> 05:50:50,828
yeah

1907
05:50:55,976 --> 05:51:01,467
here's the thing it doesn't matter if I save
the setting because they've already

1908
05:51:01,953 --> 05:51:05,496
they've already been sent

1909
05:51:07,785 --> 05:51:15,425
so they're already cute up like I disable
them something just so you know going
forward in the future

1910
05:51:15,672 --> 05:51:17,490
thanks for the follow us

1911
05:51:23,863 --> 05:51:26,680
so what what happened was

1912
05:51:29,627 --> 05:51:33,625
I mean I I click disable follow alerts and
it still doing it

1913
05:51:34,229 --> 05:51:37,727
because they've already been sent

1914
05:51:39,790 --> 05:51:47,373
and I don't know so it actually doesn't even
work to turn it off through streamlabs
because

1915
05:51:48,450 --> 05:51:56,286
and they've already been cute everything
cute up so

1916
05:51:58,043 --> 05:52:07,920
yep they're doing nothing we can do there I
just need to know that streamlabs is useless
in this regard you can't help me fix
anything

1917
05:52:10,866 --> 05:52:16,563
there at best I can do is just turn off the
notification

1918
05:52:18,984 --> 05:52:22,653
and

1919
05:52:24,735 --> 05:52:31,790
I don't even know how to block that this
email snow yeah

1920
05:52:33,833 --> 05:52:39,957
we don't punish users her victims about
attacks reporting a handful of accounts

1921
05:52:40,231 --> 05:52:44,020
you have estimated okay I'll have to give
that a try

1922
05:52:47,301 --> 05:52:54,794
yeah it's like I hate that that takes time
to do that it's like takes so much time to
do that shit

1923
05:52:56,016 --> 05:52:57,569
it's like you know

1924
05:53:01,689 --> 05:53:13,060
and I'll go back and do that I'll do it when
it's like a waste of time I want to finish
our stuff we almost got it done all right so

1925
05:53:13,938 --> 05:53:15,473
whatever

1926
05:53:21,779 --> 05:53:23,300
yeah

1927
05:53:31,095 --> 05:53:34,770
oh shit that's why it happened oh my God

1928
05:53:37,777 --> 05:53:42,816
I just got done is anonymous

1929
05:53:46,485 --> 05:53:49,521
it's just that I think that I think I see
what happened

1930
05:53:49,842 --> 05:53:54,842
yeah yeah I think I think I saw happen

1931
05:53:59,721 --> 05:54:07,324
so so the cyber security people chess

1932
05:54:10,407 --> 05:54:15,039
so so a cyber-security person posted me

1933
05:54:15,876 --> 05:54:20,938
and it went to a hacker crew

1934
05:54:20,938 --> 05:54:25,260
and the hacker crew thought it would be fun
to lunch about it me

1935
05:54:25,260 --> 05:54:30,151
to give you some extra followers which exit
warms my heart

1936
05:54:33,032 --> 05:54:39,088
because I know why they were doing it but
they I don't appreciate

1937
05:54:39,888 --> 05:54:47,052
I think now I know as it's starting to come
clear I think I know what happened here I
think I know what happened to her

1938
05:54:47,053 --> 05:54:59,331
somebody thought they were doing me a favor
by giving you a ton of extra followers
because somebody on one of the cybersecurity
that that post that tweet just went out 35
minutes ago

1939
05:55:00,058 --> 05:55:10,174
so which I really appreciate so whoever's
watching this right now I want you to know
that I appreciate the efforts

1940
05:55:10,175 --> 05:55:23,550
but please don't send Bots follow Bots at me
I know you're trying to help me and you want
to change the world and that's awesome and
you got the skills and everything but but if
you're watching right now

1941
05:55:23,552 --> 05:55:27,876
please just know that this is you know it
was other ways to get the word out

1942
05:55:27,060 --> 05:55:49,902
get the word out right I'm starting to put
two and two together I see what's happened
so somebody tweeted me to cybersecurity
listen to hackers you know saying hey I'm a
nice guy go follow me read me and that's
really great I really appreciate that and
then and then then some well-meaning hacker
went out there and thought they'd send fall
about after me

1943
05:55:51,337 --> 05:56:07,020
just kind of of L going to a backward
compliment but but I I don't I would rather
not have that the reason I don't want that
just so I can explain it because then I get
people in here from other channels and they
will say things like

1944
05:56:07,925 --> 05:56:23,136
all we know you just set up another Follow
by to file yourself you didn't really earn
all those followers nobody really gives a
shit about you I've had people come in here
and say that before and I don't want to give
him any any any I don't want to give him
anything to go on you had a mean

1945
05:56:24,660 --> 05:56:26,354
how to get to Twitch

1946
05:56:27,838 --> 05:56:36,316
they just they know a month which they just
ate some it says my name in there which
Linksys to my Twitch account since so
somebody saw as a twitch streamer that came
out in

1947
05:56:36,536 --> 05:57:15,305
ioki it's it's awesome I appreciate the help
and and everything and but I didn't I don't
want to sound ungrateful I just I would just
rather not have to justify my existence and
followers to somebody else later is going to
come see you and go I bet you're a hacker I
bet half of those are follower Bots and I'm
going to be like no they're not but every
time we get an instant like that it just
adds fire to their argument that people
don't really give a shit about a picture of
Stevie they were just they're just a bunch
of Autobots and and then that's not until
today

1948
05:57:15,309 --> 05:57:45,296
I do believe I got hit with a follow but
once but once it was previously and I think
it was another two after I got posted to
Defcon and some some well-meaning people out
over there I think about my way and I you
know I like thank you for the your misguided
attempt to get people to watch the back to
the community stuff so

1949
05:57:45,557 --> 05:57:55,485
back to the committee's the first used to
create the fall asleep stop by the following
announcement. So I think we can probably
turn the music back on

1950
05:57:56,281 --> 05:58:02,338
I want that too many have something like 30
or 40 or something 1020 I don't know

1951
05:58:02,339 --> 05:58:31,447
I don't I don't know if I have to report it
but probably should report it but I'm really
conflicted now because I really feel
strongly that the people who sent the ball
out my way were friends of the station of
the stream and they were trying to do the
right thing and I don't feel I'm really
conflicted about reporting them because it's
like yes I want them to go clean them up but
I also I mean it's like I don't know I'm
saying

1952
05:58:31,451 --> 05:58:57,538
hello it to tell you the truth I did say hey
go to go we know you got child born here so
maybe it was somebody is trying to throw me
in the it wasn't it wasn't really a
complimentary thing I don't know what it is
the standard think you should probably be to
take 20 minutes out of my day and go report
in five or six of those accounts and then
just move on and not even over think it and
just go from that go from that way from
scratch by the hell not

1953
05:58:57,551 --> 05:59:05,074
you got a good I think I need to report it
yeah

1954
05:59:05,074 --> 05:59:31,164
I think which I think is what she needs to
do it I have had my my followers go down by
$700 for four or something like that and
like overnight with a 4570 Dennis to range
of Boston and hit us and stuff yeah I'm
going to report it I'm not going to let it
go but but I think that counts that I'll
report to the ones that actually posted to
the chat about child porn

1955
05:59:31,166 --> 05:59:34,314
those are the ones I'm going to definitely
report

1956
05:59:36,446 --> 05:59:41,726
I'm going to do that want to take a moment
to do that if you guys want to go watch
something else I understand

1957
05:59:43,692 --> 05:59:50,281
so I can do this is by cooking on

1958
05:59:50,546 --> 05:59:58,051
and and I got going to report them

1959
05:59:58,052 --> 06:00:04,733
Contra 4 for my hair I think you could
report missing yes

1960
06:00:04,738 --> 06:00:08,151
in a month span was just thinking about
accounts nextwhat's next

1961
06:00:10,341 --> 06:00:13,103
next at the fast way to do it

1962
06:00:17,972 --> 06:00:19,599
watch and see

1963
06:00:25,872 --> 06:00:28,012
okay

1964
06:00:29,012 --> 06:00:40,046
give me a second we just you guys wanted to
do something else while I'm doing this so I
don't care that I'm going to there's one two
three four of them that I'm going to report

1965
06:00:40,369 --> 06:00:42,102
and that should be fine

1966
06:00:45,785 --> 06:00:49,880
and I don't have a moderator cuz I'm poor

1967
06:00:53,098 --> 06:00:55,367
spambot account

1968
06:01:14,143 --> 06:01:24,773

uneven unique

1970
06:01:45,154 --> 06:01:51,711
sure I think that was it

1971
06:01:55,169 --> 06:02:01,153
I do like that it called out the first time
chats from viewers because then I was able
to find it you know

1972
06:02:03,115 --> 06:02:10,576
Eternal Ray Rayden Eternal raid and how are

1994
06:05:56,685 --> 06:06:03,139
they were in the right place

1995

so how are we going to do where to go ahead
and

1996
06:06:14,445 --> 06:06:17,473
it is it is it doesn't make sense to me

1997
06:06:24,409 --> 06:06:27,273
different different different

1998
06:06:29,494 --> 06:06:32,481
was Cornelius is that it is not in the
system

1999
06:06:40,898 --> 06:06:45,196
it's like your system that's very odd

2000
06:06:47,398 --> 06:06:54,525
yeah we did that I think it doesn't know
about it it's like as if something or
networking is not working

2001
06:06:56,099 --> 06:07:03,275
yeah

2002
06:07:06,781 --> 06:07:11,309
no no no no there's no DS anywhere near this

2003
06:07:16,641 --> 06:07:22,628
app what's the air

2004
06:07:23,994 --> 06:07:31,044
oh there's never there is no error

2005
06:07:37,838 --> 06:07:43,993
there's no locks and something until you
can't I can't get logs this can't I can't
see it so

2006
06:08:01,796 --> 06:08:07,402
so I can do the running one and then crashed
upon it it can't it can't see it

2007
06:08:08,154 --> 06:08:13,089
long is on that server cannot find request
resource

2008
06:08:14,227 --> 06:08:19,173
pod / log calculator so

2009
06:08:19,818 --> 06:08:26,554
I thought logs were only for nodes no
they're not nevermind

2010
06:08:29,287 --> 06:08:34,398
just another Chris resource different find
really weird

2011
06:08:34,875 --> 06:08:39,161
I feel like it's the network problem cuz it
can't tell that it's even there

2012
06:08:39,500 --> 06:08:49,456
I think we did

2013
06:08:49,590 --> 06:08:55,632
yeah that would be my guess too I don't
think we did

2014
06:08:59,209 --> 06:09:05,918
you're going to shoot me I don't think we
did we talked about it we talked about doing
it and I was like all over the place

2015
06:09:05,991 --> 06:09:12,945
I don't know it's dead why we need to the IP
stuff

2016
06:09:12,945 --> 06:09:14,510
that could be

2017
06:09:22,639 --> 06:09:26,085
I mean I can remember things

2018
06:09:32,143 --> 06:09:38,405
inactive dead Jesus is able

2019
06:09:39,309 --> 06:10:02,143
I want to I'm thinking it might be something
you might be the node then some of that we
have to go back because it could have been
that we did it out of order like I didn't do
the remember we skip this so we skip the
section right here right

2020
06:10:03,219 --> 06:10:18,655
and then we came back and I was like one of
his work and I do that again that order has
two matters we did this first and then we
came back and we turned firewall off and we
had a number of other things we did this
other stuff after the fact and I think I
think that might be the problem

2021
06:10:19,651 --> 06:10:27,091
I I think that might be I know we didn't
want with your mom I was on there and that's
all there

2022
06:10:27,448 --> 06:10:32,661
so yeah and it's a small thing we do that

2023
06:10:34,672 --> 06:10:42,314
yeah I could reset the the cute little bit
here until happens to just try that anybody
disagree

2024
06:10:43,459 --> 06:10:46,581
yeah I see the fun

2025
06:10:46,675 --> 06:10:52,585
like a fun can we always wanted at

2026
06:10:52,948 --> 06:10:55,187
where are the laws written

2027
06:10:55,583 --> 06:11:10,892
on the nodes are not written of our lock
right isn't there the lungs are generated
from something can we can can we do it at
Kristi's yeah what's that I see I don't know
I knew there was something that I didn't
know about crazy so we don't have to stay
down here or we do now

2028
06:11:11,085 --> 06:11:12,990
you'll never know

2029
06:11:18,601 --> 06:11:23,861
orvar lock containers yeah

2030
06:11:31,145 --> 06:11:36,686
shit which is the one we're using right now

2031
06:11:37,777 --> 06:11:44,965
each all the same Calico node

2032
06:11:46,350 --> 06:11:51,975
yeah let's do oh God

2033
06:11:53,506 --> 06:12:00,379
Calico system how are you are you actually
Lucas

2034
06:12:04,531 --> 06:12:12,367
there we go interconnecting today to store
trying to get

2035
06:12:12,367 --> 06:12:18,015
why is it trying to go to 10. Oh that's the
service

2036
06:12:21,093 --> 06:12:26,663
that means it's not getting routed right
yeah

2037
06:12:27,274 --> 06:12:30,945
that means our Bridge Network stuff is
probably failed

2038
06:12:31,504 --> 06:12:37,956
I probably yeah I can't touch this can't
touch this

2039
06:12:39,132 --> 06:12:46,868
I'm guessing that means that are all of the
cheese guy tables riding stuff it didn't
take Jenna mean

2040
06:12:48,634 --> 06:12:51,185
yeah

2041
06:12:57,811 --> 06:12:59,862
that's it

2042
06:13:01,243 --> 06:13:14,296
I'm going to set the info don't even if I
referred your name to to your name to
starting newest version blah chicken
greatest or hit are connected to data store

2043
06:13:15,145 --> 06:13:20,575
retry error gets 443

2044
06:13:22,715 --> 06:13:27,836
dial and got a timeout so

2045
06:13:27,841 --> 06:13:31,509
it could not reach this and we couldn't take
it either

2046
06:13:31,630 --> 06:13:36,026
not to me that means that there is a Creo
stuff didn't get pushed out

2047
06:13:36,734 --> 06:13:44,594
now I thought you could do I thought you
could do the Calico stuff ahead of time I
didn't think you had to have that after the
fact you know what I mean

2048
06:13:44,717 --> 06:13:52,593
I didn't think you had to have the Calico
stuff before you to the other installs right
but apparently you do

2049
06:14:02,016 --> 06:14:04,388
so

2050
06:14:18,797 --> 06:14:24,100
hello he doesn't work with service a piece
right

2051
06:14:25,080 --> 06:14:28,290
it has to be routed in the in the proxy or
something

2052
06:14:28,872 --> 06:14:36,796
I think I think what's happening is to keep
rocks is not working because the chemical
damage that didn't work

2053
06:14:40,806 --> 06:14:48,564
well we know that because the Calico Damon
said it didn't work. So somehow the cow
could imitate wasn't able to push down right

2054
06:14:49,604 --> 06:14:55,562
I mean this is good I like I like that this
is painful because this is good debugging

2055
06:14:58,540 --> 06:15:05,388
so I obviously can't talk to

2056
06:15:06,959 --> 06:15:10,821
I know what the IP rules are I want to say
that

2057
06:15:16,551 --> 06:15:18,772
okay the net filters in

2058
06:15:20,113 --> 06:15:29,443
and did the IP study the Feast of TCP table
stuff gets saved member that so

2059
06:15:31,005 --> 06:15:33,359
that was supposed to be

2060
06:15:35,847 --> 06:15:42,899
mr. Frankie right we did that that's all I
know is this can make it in right

2061
06:15:43,936 --> 06:15:47,247
is this making it and is it the right number

2062
06:15:48,305 --> 06:15:55,909
have a for the said container do you but I
feel like that's okay that stuff is in there
we just checked it and made it in so

2063
06:15:57,697 --> 06:16:05,177
did I not restart systemctl on all the
systems maybe that was it

2064
06:16:10,916 --> 06:16:15,604
I mean I'm pretty sure we changed the values
their yeah

2065
06:16:16,408 --> 06:16:23,655
it did take did it take cctl

2066
06:16:25,612 --> 06:16:33,517
I thought Susie Ellis was out of there we go
applying

2067
06:16:33,660 --> 06:16:36,223
nfsi Be Tails

2068
06:16:38,797 --> 06:16:44,045
wait what it didn't like the radius one are
there it is

2069
06:16:46,914 --> 06:16:48,103
oh

2070
06:16:50,913 --> 06:16:55,648
wait a second it's not a high enough number
you seeing this

2071
06:16:56,728 --> 06:17:02,348
I didn't happen before though that presents
a call if you can lose one

2072
06:17:08,833 --> 06:17:12,147
count all the Sable IPv6

2073
06:17:18,861 --> 06:17:24,696
cuz all the sale if you sexy we haven't
disable selinux

2074
06:17:27,856 --> 06:17:33,785
we didn't do that that's another thing we
didn't do

2075
06:17:36,082 --> 06:17:40,248
I think I need to do it I think every single
thing needs to be done

2076
06:17:41,334 --> 06:17:49,319
I think is I'm going to say it sassy Lenox I
bet that's it I mean it I don't see how it
would

2077
06:17:52,591 --> 06:17:55,267
after five sister to tell

2078
06:18:05,766 --> 06:18:08,358
at me when we have to

2079
06:18:13,510 --> 06:18:19,856
oh it's gone already that's good right

2080
06:18:26,132 --> 06:18:33,192
oh I thought that we had to cursive Echo

2081
06:18:49,543 --> 06:18:54,527
turn on name so same time out

2082
06:18:58,786 --> 06:19:05,928
that's the only way I could think of it we
didn't do other than that we did stuff out
of order you know

2083
06:19:08,549 --> 06:19:14,453
I do I think we did it out of work I think
that's a problem so so yeah

2084
06:19:22,059 --> 06:19:27,907
I think they tell that we have the UNC or
something if you have been seeing her do not

2085
06:19:28,064 --> 06:19:31,738
how is telnet still in still in your that's
like you're stupid

2086
06:19:40,046 --> 06:19:44,537
nope that would be no

2087
06:19:47,314 --> 06:19:51,043
I think we already have we just use it if
all calico last time

2088
06:19:52,611 --> 06:19:57,234
the problem here is we did all the steps or
just did them out of order

2089
06:20:00,814 --> 06:20:07,606
yeah I think that's how we found the problem
last time this is how we found the problem
last time I remember

2090
06:20:15,688 --> 06:20:28,971
is getting routed right

2091
06:20:40,673 --> 06:20:48,160
Juju did you do it's a very well I kind of
want to start over and find it

2092
06:20:49,066 --> 06:20:59,707
because I feel like I feel like we know what
this is I think they're just it's like
something that we dropped in the cracks I
dropped in the cracks

2093
06:21:02,262 --> 06:21:13,480
I want to think that I want to say that some
of the configuration steps failed because we
didn't have the networking working at first
but I thought you could do less than we did
it we got

2094
06:21:14,904 --> 06:21:21,217
probably not get to the state again what do
you mean in order to be able to check it
like this

2095
06:21:24,916 --> 06:21:27,771
it's a weird State don't you think

2096
06:21:27,975 --> 06:21:37,352
where do you find the debugging but I don't
think we're going to get I don't think we're
going to get do you think we can get this
far so I know we can get this far again if
that's

2097
06:21:37,549 --> 06:21:45,303
yeah order troubleshoot it right I see
you're saying yeah so use the opportunity to
like look for the problem

2098
06:21:47,505 --> 06:21:50,400
yeah I mean that's that's diable

2099
06:21:52,997 --> 06:21:55,908
there's something going on with networking

2100
06:22:01,027 --> 06:22:08,428
I mean the only thing I know of this related
to Internet working at all is

2101
06:22:11,303 --> 06:22:13,297
this stuff

2102
06:22:21,727 --> 06:22:27,354
my TPMS repair all day

2103
06:22:30,329 --> 06:22:40,350
I mean we had this this is different to
write to advertise the API so I wonder if
it's still try and use the defaults in that
stuff and that spring up the routing

2104
06:22:40,352 --> 06:22:43,951
I thought we were supposed to get that out
of there

2105
06:23:17,703 --> 06:23:20,517
I mean it looks fine to me

2106
06:23:24,284 --> 06:23:27,188
Le Creuset ship yes

2107
06:23:31,705 --> 06:23:34,508
and then go sit and then it goes to sub

2108
06:23:37,748 --> 06:23:44,792
and then it goes to a zoo going and it's
going to 172 Network

2109
06:23:46,008 --> 06:23:48,703
why is it going to the 172 Network

2110
06:23:52,234 --> 06:23:56,273
this is an external address yeah

2111
06:24:00,779 --> 06:24:08,190
this should not be there yeah

2112
06:24:12,825 --> 06:24:14,769
it's like it's pulling

2113
06:24:23,869 --> 06:24:26,890
there isn't one either is RS

2114
06:24:31,153 --> 06:24:38,353
I'll let you know what they say that to do
that too that was this was the

2115
06:24:39,609 --> 06:24:42,160
so it's trying to do not

2116
06:24:42,542 --> 06:24:47,873
and since we don't have Nat because we
didn't label it on the other interface

2117
06:24:50,249 --> 06:24:54,176
that's weird okay that's

2118
06:24:56,213 --> 06:25:09,733
then okay yeah then added the natted version
was working before I only had 10 dots before
we didn't answer and I P's this time is the
first time we had our own IP I bet you
that's it

2119
06:25:09,805 --> 06:25:12,816
I bet you that's it I bet I bet you

2120
06:25:13,466 --> 06:25:19,050
we need to expressly say we want and adding
on the other router on the other network

2121
06:25:20,041 --> 06:25:24,834
yeah I bet I bet that's it

2122
06:25:27,345 --> 06:25:31,485
I don't know where ever try on this is it

2123
06:25:33,883 --> 06:25:36,996
why is it easy to pee

2124
06:25:44,999 --> 06:25:51,700
has been a long time since I've done that is
Emily there it's Emily listening

2125
06:25:54,501 --> 06:25:55,722
yeah

2126
06:26:02,715 --> 06:26:08,802
that's right ain't that that stuff my riding
in listening so

2127
06:26:09,838 --> 06:26:13,730
I mean we could probably prove it by looking
your logs on the server

2128
06:26:16,731 --> 06:26:23,911
how can you look in the server logs I'm
going to look enter the API server logs

2129
06:26:24,685 --> 06:26:28,202
and I don't know how to look at those weird
look at that

2130
06:26:33,967 --> 06:26:38,131
what's restaurants in Albuquerque

2131
06:26:44,189 --> 06:26:47,925
keep Roxy notes

2132
06:26:48,725 --> 06:26:53,608
for some restart I would not have known to
do that that's a great idea though

2133
06:26:54,187 --> 06:26:57,353
is that a ccic tail thing

2134
06:26:59,190 --> 06:27:13,123
or I can I get with you I just have to
export Q config equals and securities detail

2135
06:27:18,275 --> 06:27:24,597
well yeah cuz if you can't talk to her right
now that was just reading that was just
remove it from here

2136
06:27:26,111 --> 06:27:31,911
alright let's try that advance

2137
06:27:32,827 --> 06:27:45,670
okay so this one is working only because
it's running on this system right oh I see
they're saying maybe because we did all the
restarts and everything that is still stuck
in a crashing but then we need to be okay

2138
06:27:45,672 --> 06:27:48,201
I see I see

2139
06:28:04,255 --> 06:28:11,481
foxy Melissa tripods firstit's going to go
back in the car it's going to go back into
it

2140
06:28:12,926 --> 06:28:19,734
you want you want to reset the proxies as
well huh okay I mean I seem fine

2141
06:28:20,569 --> 06:28:26,740
but it's only the proxy is not happy I want
to see what happens when the sun resorts

2142
06:28:27,814 --> 06:28:32,761
and same problem same old problem

2143
06:28:38,786 --> 06:28:44,346
I mean 222

2144
06:28:50,341 --> 06:28:54,885
well would you look at that there any just
not ready now

2145
06:28:57,452 --> 06:28:59,852
so

2146
06:29:10,926 --> 06:29:14,010
search did not find request sister source

2147
06:29:21,104 --> 06:29:23,581
I don't know we had a crash you back off

2148
06:29:25,953 --> 06:29:29,787
and now we don't even scratch the thing for
a second there

2149
06:29:29,976 --> 06:29:41,254
mostly because it wasn't ready say are you
saying it's going to go into Crossley
because it's not ready yet for sure about
time all right that was okay I think it's
the same as just yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2150
06:29:41,256 --> 06:29:46,071
yeah yeah yeah alright so that's a mess to
miss misleading

2151
06:29:46,437 --> 06:29:57,609
I am restoring the proxies and seems like a
practice or whatever is responsible for the
network interaction is not working why can't
we just redo the the name is set for the
whole thing

2152
06:29:57,610 --> 06:30:05,302
can we just do that it's like not a cool
thing to do but

2153
06:30:06,907 --> 06:30:09,142
are you rolling restart

2154
06:30:13,995 --> 06:30:18,734
I do that because you we will restart it and
it keep going to just kill the replicas okay

2155
06:30:20,451 --> 06:30:27,362
I mean it seems like doing the damage that
by itself would be would be prudent

2156
06:30:29,063 --> 06:30:32,787
sounds like the same and said maybe we could
add it back

2157
06:30:33,737 --> 06:30:39,634
the Red Leaf anymore refreshes everything
but yeah

2158
06:30:51,445 --> 06:30:57,623
if we didn't do them instead it will not
refresh obviously we have to make our own
damn and set

2159
06:30:57,633 --> 06:31:05,027
empathetic the deposit refresh if we just
keep it inside okay I see what you're trying
to do I think I do anyway

2160
06:31:05,789 --> 06:31:09,872
so it's raining men that just came right up

2161
06:31:11,693 --> 06:31:21,503
and create again but it's usually deposit
you have to think this pain seems like they
came right up they just pop right up so

2162
06:31:21,635 --> 06:31:26,768
and then there's a crash that back off is
snuck in after that because it's not running

2163
06:31:27,808 --> 06:31:31,142
yeah there's something going on with a
networking

2164
06:31:34,289 --> 06:31:38,034
I don't expect expect this is going to work
but

2165
06:31:40,586 --> 06:31:50,881
we did not have this from lesson though that
is for sure it's other related to this to
the IPS that we set up where we did
something in the wrong order

2166
06:31:53,108 --> 06:31:59,927
transfer Summit it was working that's how it
was working I swear to God

2167
06:32:01,754 --> 06:32:08,123
because it was holding the Connection open
I'm pretty sure it was working

2168
06:32:08,123 --> 06:32:16,025
makes me want to get an m on their or Nancy
or something 00 the first one out the second

2169
06:32:16,464 --> 06:32:24,249
oh right right okay so you're saying yeah

2170
06:32:24,249 --> 06:32:28,781
I just want to say so this is a success in
my opinion

2171
06:32:28,781 --> 06:32:36,647
take me to just have a connection then we
didn't even connect at all right so

2172
06:32:37,729 --> 06:32:41,443
why why did Senate 96

2173
06:32:41,443 --> 06:32:46,157
that's the service

2174
06:32:50,418 --> 06:32:56,408
this is going to work astray

2175
06:33:01,785 --> 06:33:06,760
that's a crazy person right guy 37643 Wright

2176
06:33:07,285 --> 06:33:15,401
why are we going are we going to record
today if you're a server to make sure that
it's getting a routing properly to the main
server and then go to the other stuff

2177
06:33:15,949 --> 06:33:22,864
what am I no dice is a 4 / 3

2178
06:33:24,519 --> 06:33:25,921
Paradise

2179
06:33:30,086 --> 06:33:32,750
maybe if your Serene be restarted

2180
06:33:33,667 --> 06:33:41,601
I mean it's possible no it wouldn't be
because because if your servers working
because of the know this running on the
system is fine

2181
06:33:42,625 --> 06:33:48,853
I mean the accordionist fathers on their the
Calico pot

2182
06:33:50,274 --> 06:33:55,459
wow that's so shiny and wonderful

2183
06:33:58,723 --> 06:34:08,805
it doesn't look original it's so good it
looks like it was like Factory done you know
what I mean it's like

2184
06:34:09,946 --> 06:34:15,145
it is a compliment but I I can't see it cuz
I have any light

2185
06:34:16,894 --> 06:34:20,236
they don't have any light thank you

2186
06:34:28,676 --> 06:34:33,318
is so pretty is very pretty

2187
06:34:38,921 --> 06:34:46,274
you don't know where you're going oops

2188
06:34:51,697 --> 06:34:57,020
I know they're like they're what are they
doors what's the art

2189
06:34:58,951 --> 06:35:08,209
I want to see squash but it's got this like
metallic stuff in it it's going to call she
just making like little things cuz she
doesn't have a car she could or Studio

2190
06:35:10,037 --> 06:35:16,529
a super pretty though at this point I kind
of want to just reset it

2191
06:35:17,018 --> 06:35:24,650
he'll reboot situation I need the debugging
here is useful but

2192
06:35:25,032 --> 06:35:27,635
I got a douche it

2193
06:35:33,219 --> 06:35:35,246
I think

2194
06:35:39,782 --> 06:35:44,580
went from the let's go back to the airlock
the airlines are saying

2195
06:35:56,776 --> 06:36:01,453
quasius Satan's watercolors

2196
06:36:04,207 --> 06:36:09,591
I mean I I don't see

2197
06:36:14,833 --> 06:36:22,616
I mean I just don't see an easy resolution
for this one and me where it is kind of fun
to figure it out but

2198
06:36:25,713 --> 06:36:28,829
turning onto with Virgin blah

2199
06:36:31,491 --> 06:36:34,534
well now it says it has access

2200
06:36:34,949 --> 06:36:39,569
when you get the same air I think you might
be right I think the problem went away

2201
06:36:45,189 --> 06:36:55,661
so basically the SAT for community service
not working

2202
06:37:02,508 --> 06:37:10,149
you know what I mean I think I think having
those Nat addresses in there is a bad thing

2203
06:37:16,595 --> 06:37:27,727
that really makes me want to get like figure
out how to make a vagrant situation where we
don't have Nat and we just put Bridgeton
there and maybe it would leave off that
extra that extra interface then at the
default

2204
06:37:26,872 --> 06:37:34,743
the default not interface we didn't have
this problem before I when we use the
regular eye peas and wheat the eyepiece
change

2205
06:37:35,090 --> 06:37:42,103
it was a different problem you know so the
external works

2206
06:37:48,094 --> 06:37:56,109
and that's the one that we specified it to
you is right that means that something in
the router is not connecting to it okay if
active router

2207
06:37:57,552 --> 06:38:02,341
this is so we can't we can't get our Calico
to just to report back

2208
06:38:02,552 --> 06:38:07,670
it's not it's not been able to talk over the
network to the API

2209
06:38:08,571 --> 06:38:11,279
and we turn to firewalls off on everything

2210
06:38:14,471 --> 06:38:18,440
am I maybe we proved it because we talk
directly to

2211
06:38:18,723 --> 06:38:23,266
to the the advertise API server address

2212
06:38:23,775 --> 06:38:30,307
every but we cannot talk to that one that's
the actual service but this is the API

2213
06:38:30,925 --> 06:38:35,842
wait but we don't we need to see an idea be
able to talk to it

2214
06:38:39,716 --> 06:38:42,192
I think it's supposed to be one right

2215
06:38:57,740 --> 06:38:59,502
that's one right

2216
06:39:13,616 --> 06:39:17,537
so I want to hear

2217
06:39:21,613 --> 06:39:26,611
we can talk to me if you had of the pods are
supposed to be able to bypass the API or are
they not

2218
06:39:29,910 --> 06:39:36,691
I have nothing to it a Calico lookups cuz
that's I mean how to reboot a node

2219
06:39:40,179 --> 06:39:47,216
yeah I guess they're those are going to be
fine right fuck I forgot they were virtual
so we're not going to lose everything

2220
06:39:49,128 --> 06:39:51,186
yeah I'll try to reboot

2221
06:40:01,651 --> 06:40:18,167
yeah I think that's I keep forgetting is a
virtual machines I've been doing so much
stuff with containers and feels the same
lately left here that I keep forgetting that
we have

2222
06:40:18,474 --> 06:40:25,185
NFL that we had State and reboot something

2223
06:40:25,461 --> 06:40:32,766
it says that we should do not like a long
time ago I mean that would have been is
there an l

2224
06:40:35,657 --> 06:40:38,536
can't connect to a community center

2225
06:40:38,536 --> 06:40:53,692
smsi cats around it's almost like it's like
a chicken in the egg thing so Calico is used
for pod for pain networking right and
benefit if but if the other it but if it
doesn't get setup correctly then it can't
talk to itself and it's kind of like a
chicken in the egg

2226
06:40:53,692 --> 06:40:58,951
make his Calico supposed to be handling the
routing to the 10. Network right

2227
06:40:58,952 --> 06:41:02,256
or is that there's a just4paws it's not for
services

2228
06:41:02,256 --> 06:41:13,108
does it doesn't the cousin Calico take care
of all of the Pod networking including
communication to Services between pods and
services right

2229
06:41:13,109 --> 06:41:25,197
so it's a cni it's like for the whole
fucking thing right or is it just pots
really is it just pods looking cakes for of
the service routing overcrowding from the
pods I went down with that you need to see
and I do right

2230
06:41:25,198 --> 06:41:31,407
let me know I think it would fall within
that scope that's interesting

2231
06:41:31,991 --> 06:41:39,062
then I'm learning a shit ton about
kubernetes though I'll tell you that I tell
you that

2232
06:41:39,063 --> 06:41:41,725
I don't know about y'all but I am

2233
06:41:44,041 --> 06:41:47,814
but there is serious a special in this
regard

2234
06:41:49,442 --> 06:41:54,811
well that doesn't mean to keep rocks in the
afternoon about 2:10. 96 services

2235
06:41:54,813 --> 06:41:59,543
the ceiling of the way it would know about
it right as it have internal knowledge of it

2236
06:42:02,514 --> 06:42:07,124
and keeping text it doesn't have anything to
do with this and I

2237
06:42:08,186 --> 06:42:10,835
keep Roxie cell okay yeah

2238
06:42:11,490 --> 06:42:43,926
yeah okay say I'm trying to identify what
does what like where the rules are if if you
broke it wasn't working none of the cube CDL
stuff would work after our initial install
without Calico nothing there would be no way
to communicate because you keep Roxie
couldn't couldn't check on anything it
couldn't even go down and check out the so
so okay that's super cool to know so the
Baseline the Baseline Cubit to control plane
networking is covered by Q proxy

2239
06:42:48,646 --> 06:42:53,996
Pata Pata give CDL connect directly to the
API so right

2240
06:42:58,545 --> 06:43:12,889
yeah but but yes okay yes keep ccl4 sure is
an API thing but it's reporting on status
that's being generated by talking to the Q
blood when it says it's not ready

2241
06:43:13,780 --> 06:43:18,412
I don't think that means it's never
communicated with it or does it

2242
06:43:19,780 --> 06:43:27,292
I wish you would know about it we haven't
even know about if it hadn't communicated
some point so

2243
06:43:27,804 --> 06:43:38,330
what I'm trying to say is I think that
there's networking that's happening between
keep Roxy in the control plane that's
independent of the networking that's
happening between the pods

2244
06:43:39,721 --> 06:43:46,277
I'm sorry dear ho we're doing it's pretty
it's pretty low-level Community stuff

2245
06:43:47,441 --> 06:43:50,005
check note to now

2246
06:44:13,153 --> 06:44:19,457
oh my God that I don't know how it's running
again ask you the same thing

2247
06:44:20,377 --> 06:44:24,790
I think it's weird is it the one that's on
the system works

2248
06:44:26,408 --> 06:44:34,286
yeah well this was the 124 this is and this
is we're pretty sure this is the one that's
on the host

2249
06:44:34,972 --> 06:44:41,229
we did that we're just checking logs you
can't run logs on it that's how we know it's
fucked up

2250
06:44:41,849 --> 06:44:47,794
you can't you have to go into the system to
get the logs as we were just doing cell

2251
06:44:52,085 --> 06:44:56,044
no is he can't talk.

2252
06:44:56,044 --> 06:45:03,668
So and then and then we went down here and
went straight to the logs

2253
06:45:10,986 --> 06:45:13,142
nice

2254
06:45:17,973 --> 06:45:26,650
describe doesn't give us a neither the best
we can figure out as it can't the way we
were determined this is when we looked at
the log

2255
06:45:26,652 --> 06:45:34,053
which is now going my answer is gone on your
mind and I still have it thank God

2256
06:45:37,279 --> 06:45:44,819
arioso we went straight to the log and that
locks is it can't talk

2257
06:45:45,209 --> 06:45:49,899
no I says I don't know what you're talkin
about

2258
06:45:56,270 --> 06:45:59,629
well I didn't work

2259
06:45:59,629 --> 06:46:07,063
I know you don't need seen I'm working
that's why that's why we do Keep Rocks to
get you that stuff right I mean that's what
we figured but

2260
06:46:07,064 --> 06:46:12,711
we don't have any communication whatsoever
so

2261
06:46:15,316 --> 06:46:22,856
and checking database store I'm trying to
get to the one that's

2262
06:46:28,316 --> 06:46:32,558
there you go this is the are we got

2263
06:46:36,904 --> 06:46:44,434
yeah it it can't talk to the tenant 96
services

2264
06:46:44,434 --> 06:46:50,729
and we look at iptables and and we looked on
the firewall

2265
06:46:53,402 --> 06:46:55,020
as should be

2266
06:47:01,659 --> 06:47:08,281
inactive firewall we were thinking it could
have been for forwarding wasn't said and we
looked at all of that

2267
06:47:10,750 --> 06:47:12,543
like I think I have that cell

2268
06:47:16,641 --> 06:47:26,502
before it's at we tell that it to the 192
thing and got a connection with telling her
to 1096 and don't get anyting

2269
06:47:27,112 --> 06:47:28,619
so

2270
06:47:29,548 --> 06:47:48,747
we tell them to the external API interface
and it works fine if we telling that to the
internal interface it doesn't work I thought
you can you answer this question is routing
to the services covered by proxy or does
that require a cni to be installed

2271
06:47:50,042 --> 06:47:53,571
I would think it would work without that

2272
06:47:56,971 --> 06:48:04,701
okay well I mean the only thing that's
different between this and what we did last
time

2273
06:48:06,253 --> 06:48:09,268
IP for in the colonel yet

2274
06:48:09,640 --> 06:48:24,104
did the only thing that's different between
this and what we did last time is in this
one we have specified the IP addresses and
we we had to do something different we had
to do this the first time I've ever had to
do this

2275
06:48:24,323 --> 06:48:34,030
right we didn't need to do that last time we
going to do that but that's because we have
specific IP addresses that's the first thing
and the second thing

2276
06:48:34,321 --> 06:48:46,167
is we sorted itself out of order and so it's
possible that we missed something but it
it's consistent across both servers

2277
06:48:49,195 --> 06:48:54,773
no we were on the verge no I don't think so

2278
06:48:56,542 --> 06:49:04,246
when delivered I want to say we got this
work without livered no we didn't

2279
06:49:06,091 --> 06:49:13,450
situated we definitely were because we had
it yeah we did it right

2280
06:49:13,491 --> 06:49:15,628
you're absolutely right

2281
06:49:27,978 --> 06:49:34,123
no no we weren't we were on virtualbox we
got it working over some box

2282
06:49:34,123 --> 06:49:38,552
yeah I did I shipped that over

2283
06:49:40,624 --> 06:49:47,307
Spotify communication alcoholism

2284
06:49:47,307 --> 06:49:54,956
so so we've got I mean to go back to the
controller

2285
06:50:05,381 --> 06:50:14,332
yeah so we have that this is working because
it's it's that's a note on control plane and
used to or not

2286
06:50:19,401 --> 06:50:21,429
that's all

2287
06:50:21,429 --> 06:50:29,368
and we can't get logs from thrown away but
we wanted to see if there was if there's
anything we can learn in the process here

2288
06:50:32,849 --> 06:50:40,363
yeah I was super surprised just working met
services in there but for some reason
doesn't work yeah

2289
06:50:45,508 --> 06:50:49,301
no we haven't looked in the sea and I can
forgive yours

2290
06:50:50,496 --> 06:50:53,752
but that is potipot stuff right

2291
06:50:59,125 --> 06:51:01,769
I wants you doing

2292
06:51:07,888 --> 06:51:11,908
is this not working because if I deposit
stuff not working

2293
06:51:15,323 --> 06:51:17,926
yeah just going to say

2294
06:51:20,943 --> 06:51:27,933
the end

2295
06:51:27,687 --> 06:51:31,534
the end it's like it's like the weight of
the pain the pain wrong

2296
06:51:35,184 --> 06:51:38,565
that's fine we're just we're just playing
around the bunch of ideas here

2297
06:51:39,173 --> 06:51:43,722
I'm about ready to start it over because
Reasons I'm just you know

2298
06:51:50,501 --> 06:51:54,467
d i p 792 addresses him

2299
06:51:59,627 --> 06:52:07,188
wait well that's interesting now eth1

2300
06:52:07,624 --> 06:52:15,385
so this is different from before we have
that we have the NAT at 1 and then I kind of
feel like we should take it off

2301
06:52:16,468 --> 06:52:20,544
and we take it off though and then are they
going to say don't work anymore

2302
06:52:20,684 --> 06:52:25,395
which we do need to work maybe we should
disable this interface completely

2303
06:52:27,668 --> 06:52:29,517
every time yeah

2304
06:52:29,975 --> 06:52:35,968
yep and we got it we got it working before
they can use it again

2305
06:52:36,774 --> 06:52:38,584
secretary start

2306
06:52:49,261 --> 06:52:55,668
Q controller manager yep that was started

2307
06:52:59,764 --> 06:53:03,098
I think the issue is because of you th-02

2308
06:53:05,509 --> 06:53:11,817
can you make a minute if you have cirrhosis
I think we already did that

2309
06:53:13,291 --> 06:53:21,020
I agree I think we did started with that did
I use yeah

2310
06:53:22,546 --> 06:53:24,976
pretty sure we did that

2311
06:53:25,136 --> 06:53:31,715
that's how we started for sure we did the
API server thing I put in my notes

2312
06:53:32,605 --> 06:53:37,136
yeah that that is something that's different
no we did not do that before

2313
06:53:38,534 --> 06:53:42,963
now I did the to the 2.2 which is you know

2314
06:53:43,428 --> 06:53:51,413
but I get that wrong if I got that wrong we
would have any we would have any
communication all right

2315
06:53:52,310 --> 06:53:57,375
yeah when I supposed to do that too so

2316
06:53:58,089 --> 06:54:05,817
it says they might have gotten that number
wrong we've been screwed

2317
06:54:06,197 --> 06:54:13,450
so that I so that's the command I asked you
at 3 and 3/4

2318
06:54:14,801 --> 06:54:22,292
they should be three and four to go check
huh yep

2319
06:54:28,742 --> 06:54:31,449
ipps

2320
06:54:37,938 --> 06:54:53,467
they're using ebf back in and old and to all
the colonel has fell so far is it going to
send the order

2321
06:54:53,468 --> 06:55:22,916
the weirdest stuff from kind of willy-nilly
I think that might be it and the addition of
a specific IP network for the API that is
that is it I feel like something is hitting
the default router in Fountain failing
that's what I feel like is happening I don't
know how but I feel like something is going
to to this defaults interface and is not
observing this new thing

2322
06:55:24,366 --> 06:55:31,830
I feel like that's I think that's what's
happening but that's really a sweet hard to
nail down

2323
06:55:31,888 --> 06:55:34,359
so

2324
06:55:34,894 --> 06:55:40,322
we restarted the network and stuff

2325
06:55:41,691 --> 06:55:44,127
yeah

2326
06:55:45,668 --> 06:55:52,107
how to configure which works a Cisco it did
that's why I'm saying so

2327
06:55:52,107 --> 06:56:08,073
yeah I feel like we need to go back through
the steps and follow them in order according
to the thing I did some things like mod Pro
man and adding you to be our net filter and
all that stuff after before we do the
California sell the book but after

2328
06:56:07,395 --> 06:56:09,475
after we do some of the other stuff

2329
06:56:09,903 --> 06:56:19,961
so I wonder if some of those other tools and
they were installed they didn't prepare him
properly because the other pieces weren't
there

2330
06:56:22,081 --> 06:56:28,138
if it's causing issue 3 and he was taking
every time

2331
06:56:28,747 --> 06:56:34,511
yeah we're going to eat we had to force the
eyepiece don't know if you saw that but we
had to force a piece

2332
06:56:36,128 --> 06:56:38,652
we have the first step yes

2333
06:56:41,911 --> 06:56:47,015
the thing okay so here's what we need to
identify the

2334
06:56:47,999 --> 06:56:55,487
one of the Calico nose is working all right
and it's working because it doesn't have any
network problems

2335
06:56:58,027 --> 06:57:18,732
I think it's oozing host and working too and
I feel like that is what's hurting it is
using the default HughesNet working or just
the 10. Whatever not address and so he can't
resolve and then it can't figure doing the
rest can finish doing the rest that's what I
think's happening but I I don't know that
and that's why this one works

2336
06:57:28,048 --> 06:57:32,067
all the interface is really how's it going

2337
06:57:34,923 --> 06:57:44,773
interesting I think we should focus on his
why does the local one work and this one not
work so I'm going to read the logs

2338
06:57:49,104 --> 06:57:53,649
and I believe it's because I'm not working
that's the only explanation

2339
06:57:53,723 --> 06:57:57,148
want me to make sense because his errors
were like I can't see it

2340
06:57:57,397 --> 06:58:02,095
Verizon data plans using auto-text ipv4
addresses I interface and blah

2341
06:58:03,110 --> 06:58:08,006
using Auto detect that ipv4 addresses on the
interface ball

2342
06:58:09,086 --> 06:58:12,900
Auto detected V4 addresses

2343
06:58:14,603 --> 06:58:17,687
Auto detective before addresses

2344
06:58:22,704 --> 06:58:28,418
this is what's going wrong

2345
06:58:28,599 --> 06:58:32,338
it's it's not able to connect

2346
06:58:34,846 --> 06:58:42,185
I think he's trying to use host Network in
which is failing f

2347
06:58:42,185 --> 06:58:47,818
and I got out of patience I think we're
going to have to reset

2348
06:58:49,350 --> 06:58:58,801
what does Randy the reset any any other
ideas you want to run down and get a sense
of before we move on

2349
06:59:02,822 --> 06:59:04,882
I did not

2350
06:59:05,342 --> 06:59:11,727
I did not give it a pod Network cidr people
were saying I didn't need you guys to the
default

2351
06:59:13,254 --> 06:59:15,455
but maybe we do

2352
06:59:15,856 --> 06:59:29,098
I mean maybe we do that we we we
specifically talked about that and we were
like we don't need that because it'll use
the default which is the 10th of 1992 and it
seems to be using that when we went to the

2353
06:59:32,317 --> 06:59:39,024
chemical CDL no tags that's a thing oh my
God

2354
06:59:40,464 --> 06:59:42,615
on the Node

2355
06:59:54,677 --> 07:00:00,290
well well maybe Calvin again install

2356
07:00:16,696 --> 07:00:19,498
can you maybe save Everett

2357
07:00:22,969 --> 07:00:26,053
yeah Jessica Target right

2358
07:00:28,481 --> 07:00:35,430
Franklin songs in

2359
07:00:35,430 --> 07:00:41,473
hey Ian yes install

2360
07:00:48,960 --> 07:00:53,560
hey we're getting slammed again I hope not

2361
07:00:55,975 --> 07:01:01,263
sure that you got it yeah it is interesting
you should I agree

2362
07:01:06,245 --> 07:01:15,326
then this is why we're doing this right so
we can get this baptism by fire kind of
learning going on this is the kind of shit
that that you can make a class about this

2363
07:01:16,704 --> 07:01:28,429
Chanel it's like let's box up on the
different ways and see what we come up with
you know and there's no way to get that
experience other than on this

2364
07:01:29,268 --> 07:01:35,538
I feel like if I if you think if I halt you
think of a halter the agreement will keep
the state

2365
07:01:36,627 --> 07:01:39,204
let's do that let's halt it

2366
07:01:41,609 --> 07:01:48,468
how did you like it yeah this is a son
saying it's

2367
07:01:48,940 --> 07:01:55,143
do you think if I hold it if I hold him if I
shut him down or should I hold him

2368
07:01:57,148 --> 07:02:03,909
I think it's just make her down right they
are destroying our we don't do that

2369
07:02:04,239 --> 07:02:06,543
just don't want to do that

2370
07:02:09,665 --> 07:02:14,989
I don't even know what's possible here I
don't know Bakery upload down

2371
07:02:16,139 --> 07:02:23,319
do you want to suspend the machine or take
it all the way down changing cover

2372
07:02:37,900 --> 07:02:45,306
and saving it and I don't know where I put
it but I can I can get it to you somehow

2373
07:02:45,349 --> 07:02:49,396
I can be big right should we should try it

2374
07:02:59,051 --> 07:03:01,733
is spinning will use more space

2375
07:03:02,096 --> 07:03:08,584
that was after I said I don't care let's do
that I would rather you have like all the
stuff right so

2376
07:03:09,944 --> 07:03:16,654
it's what we have to do this first the first
things first let me that vagrant file

2377
07:03:16,766 --> 07:03:23,738
2 digest temp camp

2378
07:03:28,164 --> 07:03:33,282
bark vagrants we want to go work

2379
07:03:35,702 --> 07:03:41,995
Calico and

2380
07:03:42,911 --> 07:03:46,232
I mean we can just tired I just want a zip
it

2381
07:03:52,095 --> 07:03:54,192
yeah yeah

2382
07:03:58,138 --> 07:04:04,123
oh and all that actually but let's let's
let's let's save this stuff right so

2383
07:04:13,664 --> 07:04:17,857
how to find out if it's vagrant file

2384
07:04:53,760 --> 07:04:59,829
go to bed at 2 so

2385
07:05:00,041 --> 07:05:10,681
I don't have to work hard tomorrow I'm
probably not going to stream for the part of
the work work I have to do I have a ton of
stuff I'll get it done a lot faster for you

2386
07:05:10,681 --> 07:05:14,712
this is still relevant work I'm not saying
it's not but

2387
07:05:14,713 --> 07:05:21,962
I need I really need to get a crazed cluster
up and running tonight really important cuz
I got to be at singing this song

2388
07:05:21,962 --> 07:05:26,340
I did the game they came

2389
07:05:35,793 --> 07:05:37,934
all right so you should have a tag

2390
07:05:48,208 --> 07:05:56,894
there's there's the lab you and I'll try to
I don't even know where to put it where can
you store big ass files

2391
07:05:57,537 --> 07:06:03,390
I don't even know where to put big ass files
anywhere as I got a Dropbox or something

2392
07:06:05,015 --> 07:06:08,423
yes got to see the whole plushie

2393
07:06:09,341 --> 07:06:17,181
but I don't have enough room like precarious
as it is I mean

2394
07:06:27,020 --> 07:06:28,988
more Calico

2395
07:06:34,201 --> 07:06:41,352
I forgot how to do this refusing to write
arcade Fountain Central

2396
07:06:42,034 --> 07:06:44,394
s f

2397
07:06:46,821 --> 07:06:54,146
now I see if CVS has been long time to do
this pork Calico

2398
07:06:54,501 --> 07:06:59,892
Auntie Jeezy CV

2399
07:07:00,594 --> 07:07:03,629
njr ztf4 thank

2400
07:07:19,475 --> 07:07:26,591
compressed data 7K that's got to be a
problem right

2401
07:07:27,451 --> 07:07:29,491
I mean it's going to be a problem

2402
07:07:34,617 --> 07:07:40,526
I haven't been turbos in a long time xvf

2403
07:07:47,564 --> 07:07:48,877
shit

2404
07:07:54,279 --> 07:07:56,644
there's some anniversary box yeah

2405
07:07:59,462 --> 07:08:05,814
yeah I don't think anything in there useful
Butler machines about yourself

2406
07:08:08,308 --> 07:08:15,974
we have to Snapchat for the image right and
the Snapchat all three images ouch

2407
07:08:18,876 --> 07:08:21,392
yeah I don't know how valuable that is

2408
07:08:31,555 --> 07:08:44,120
well it is good news is that this crap is in
the docks or somewhere hey look Papa was
decided to fuck up my desktop again cuz Papa
was

2409
07:08:44,318 --> 07:08:49,443
and not so not happy with this latest
release of opposites such

2410
07:08:54,204 --> 07:08:59,789
I was going to run for manager I guess I
mean box whatever

2411
07:09:04,038 --> 07:09:09,162
I think I'm back now I don't need it and be
fine without it

2412
07:09:12,353 --> 07:09:15,534
now the continue run who me or they

2413
07:09:16,459 --> 07:09:22,948
I'm going to keep up with us because if my
games work that's the only reason I'm
keeping it I don't want to try

2414
07:09:23,394 --> 07:09:33,033
I think I'm going to keep using system 765
us that's going to be tough if you're going
to invest all that time in the rust desktop
environment I think that means yes

2415
07:09:36,550 --> 07:09:43,784
and saving them all that's cool I mean we
could export these

2416
07:09:47,020 --> 07:09:54,839
we can probably just take a snapshot for
nevertheless right and just for fun

2417
07:09:55,081 --> 07:09:57,196
predict another one

2418
07:09:57,945 --> 07:10:03,355
I think I'm going to say let's call it

2419
07:10:03,759 --> 07:10:09,336
calikim or calikim work okay okay

2420
07:10:13,655 --> 07:10:15,876
take Kaliko vark

2421
07:10:26,923 --> 07:10:33,718
calikim work alright so I don't know if I'm
going to delete those though

2422
07:10:43,088 --> 07:10:46,134
I don't know that's a good question

2423
07:10:52,242 --> 07:10:59,605
XSport is currently in safe state when time
will be lost if it's still running

2424
07:11:02,779 --> 07:11:10,539
I don't know man I feel like it's not
working discard Save State

2425
07:11:12,703 --> 07:11:14,184
guess we have to

2426
07:11:18,666 --> 07:11:25,242
insurance is going to save data for a used
power off the machine is that doing proper
shutdown

2427
07:11:31,727 --> 07:11:32,777
Carter

2428
07:11:35,959 --> 07:11:42,494
I wish I could be I would be cool if it kept
estate but it doesn't look like it's going
to I'm going to snapshot

2429
07:11:44,742 --> 07:11:49,433
alright so so there

2430
07:11:52,581 --> 07:11:58,610
the puppet video leftover it I kind of feel
like we need to remove them

2431
07:11:59,668 --> 07:12:07,149
there's a bike is not going to be happy with
me how to make a diamond necklace that if I
go in at a new one

2432
07:12:07,920 --> 07:12:10,222
I say I want a new one right

2433
07:12:17,085 --> 07:12:22,254
all right so you see save this date going to
go for it again

2434
07:12:22,606 --> 07:12:46,715
we know bring it all the way up that
container Tea Works we have not added the
steps for the community set up we do these
by hand so that we can observe them and
probably wants to do it in and just go for
it and disable firewall and then they
created this is the same thing that we had
running before

2435
07:12:46,715 --> 07:12:54,230
and and then we do these lists final steps
by hand so I kind of want to do that let's
go ahead and try it

2436
07:12:55,728 --> 07:13:01,889
I'm trying to find while off try it again

2437
07:13:02,952 --> 07:13:05,753
go for it lower

2438
07:13:07,059 --> 07:13:33,807
I'm going to enable that corny stuff is
going to take a while to run somebody who
had to run this and if this finishes in
their handiwork and it and it should work
and we can start debugging and and stuff and
if you got anything hoki in the middle and
in which it shouldn't be an issue because
this is very controlled statues I think we
have

2439
07:13:33,814 --> 07:13:39,039
stuff that Sarah's not going okay just do it
big current up

2440
07:13:39,039 --> 07:13:45,002
all right I'm going to do this summer to
take a break like watch it do its thing see
you at

2441
07:22:49,380 --> 07:22:55,080
all right let's look at this thing

2442
07:23:01,878 --> 07:23:03,158
are they going to call

2443
07:23:10,909 --> 07:23:12,437
antsy

2444
07:23:18,726 --> 07:23:26,524
I think it's because the pain Network
overlap with subnet and will you call it
what you doing about it

2445
07:23:28,050 --> 07:23:29,970
yeah let's fix that

2446
07:23:35,153 --> 07:23:39,785
I kind of feel like we should fix it right
away well know we should

2447
07:23:41,256 --> 07:23:45,131
we did it fix it so if this happened again
that would confirm it right

2448
07:23:50,032 --> 07:24:05,307
all right so we're on

2449
07:24:11,894 --> 07:24:15,528
he'll we should so

2450
07:24:24,966 --> 07:24:27,082
wait.

2451
07:24:31,924 --> 07:24:38,287
What are the fact that we put that in on our
way

2452
07:24:40,980 --> 07:24:42,705
I didn't have to do it

2453
07:24:49,266 --> 07:24:56,269
there's some other or some other distinction
has it but how do we how do we pass how do
we pass the slash 17 cidr

2454
07:25:01,157 --> 07:25:06,093
yeah you see I mean

2455
07:25:08,962 --> 07:25:16,927
I think that's not that's not the

2456
07:25:17,714 --> 07:25:23,853
remember they wanted to talk about the that
I do that I was at. I thought I was / 17

2457
07:25:24,923 --> 07:25:30,136
yeah the planet were so I think we should
probably still do theshe probably still do
the p a n a c h

2458
07:25:30,372 --> 07:25:33,564
yeah let's do that I'm going to hide out
here

2459
07:25:35,291 --> 07:25:39,347
yeah and it was what was it we did

2460
07:25:51,669 --> 07:25:58,442
yeah that 7 yeah you know what I'm going to
force myself to write every time

2461
07:25:59,265 --> 07:26:04,184
yeah and could we do that. I was 17

2462
07:26:06,436 --> 07:26:13,090
09 2. 168

2463
07:26:14,438 --> 07:26:20,818
128 yeah now we have it at 2

2464
07:26:23,962 --> 07:26:26,538
why what would this is my default

2465
07:26:27,335 --> 07:26:38,687
I always thought you said it was nowhere
except for some of that 24 it's why I took
them all it took me an age when they okay

2466
07:26:39,456 --> 07:26:41,289
yeah I see what's up

2467
07:26:44,285 --> 07:26:55,722
16 ^ okay alright then so we always took a
seven piece of that we have to drop that off
now got it okay so that means we're

2468
07:26:58,496 --> 07:27:05,330
I mean God we could do anything right I kind
of like the 128 one because then we put them
all

2469
07:27:06,518 --> 07:27:16,551
and I hate that what you hate that one I
guess we could do one of it as far as that
Network already taken a half and make sense
2.0 / 17

2470
07:27:18,310 --> 07:27:20,125
it doesn't seem right though

2471
07:27:30,344 --> 07:27:46,664
I'm trying to think about the Midfield so it
would be

2472
07:27:47,938 --> 07:27:53,096
eight so you said the default the default is
16 right

2473
07:27:53,836 --> 07:27:59,311
yeah I was going to say yeah so that's the
default

2474
07:27:59,563 --> 07:28:09,339
and that that overlaps because 16 says that
these two can be used for ever and we've
taken up. To minimally so we just split this
network

2475
07:28:15,993 --> 07:28:19,412
and we're trying to make it higher than that

2476
07:28:23,336 --> 07:28:30,224
I need to see the ones I need to see the son
of mask is so hard of me for me to visualize
I always need to see it

2477
07:28:30,224 --> 07:28:37,384
so that would be but what I'm wondering is
why we're not doing

2478
07:28:39,230 --> 07:28:43,403
to him I'm wondering why we're not doing 16

2479
07:28:49,797 --> 07:28:55,519
because that would be too limiting the
number of pods this is 16 and a half

2480
07:28:55,979 --> 07:28:58,297
this is what in half

2481
07:29:00,557 --> 07:29:04,172
oh that's why I want 2800 I get you

2482
07:30:08,683 --> 07:30:10,885
yeah I I get one as soon though

2483
07:30:12,423 --> 07:30:23,118
it's because it's because the bit is up as
up on here that doesn't match gets up higher
on the side and so it actually has a lot
higher value that's why yeah

2484
07:30:24,129 --> 07:30:30,994
Ore City 851 right yep and

2485
07:30:33,609 --> 07:30:42,754
oh that's right I said that message the ones
are on the lower end right Damascus the ones
and zeros are the other pieces that's what's
up right here right

2486
07:30:42,965 --> 07:30:45,725
I need it

2487
07:30:52,767 --> 07:30:54,663
a tune mean

2488
07:30:55,380 --> 07:31:13,669
yeah I really want to go through that when
we do the networking stuff I need to go
through all of the subnet calculations again
and hash out some of that mess and cutting
chopping subnets out I need to build that we
need to do it all the time I haven't done it
in years haven't done that in 20 years

2489
07:31:14,665 --> 07:31:30,024
at least at least when you're not used to it
all the time and now because I had to do it
I haven't had to do it in in any capacity it
what other is a network it guy for my own
shop or for

2490
07:31:30,105 --> 07:31:40,223
but I might be really need you I didn't even
want to see how you are as I thought he said
it was your only what the fuck is that so
it's like a southern mess with Slash
whatever number after I like oh that's what
they call it okay

2491
07:31:43,786 --> 07:31:49,481
all right so thankfully we we we don't have
to redo any of our

2492
07:31:49,590 --> 07:31:58,007
code I mean are they going to run up is is
is good so that we can do this

2493
07:31:58,416 --> 07:32:05,847
and we should be able to do this from all
three systems

2494
07:32:17,106 --> 07:32:24,176
I start again so no one is to save snow to

2495
07:32:24,440 --> 07:32:26,889
SSH control

2496
07:32:27,962 --> 07:32:36,306
clear what are you doing installations or
anything cuz we did all that already so we
see the cube ATM over here

2497
07:32:36,985 --> 07:32:42,971
Q ATM no serious you dash

2498
07:32:45,696 --> 07:32:53,066
I need to make a quickie fan I'm so weird
your Cube ATM

2499
07:32:53,066 --> 07:32:57,861
and it's and I try to remember this from
scratch

2500
07:32:58,190 --> 07:33:02,417
an API server

2501
07:33:04,710 --> 07:33:11,559
set broadcast Dash address server something

2502
07:33:11,765 --> 07:33:19,711
advertise advertise address

2503
07:33:19,712 --> 07:33:22,131
mine too

2504
07:33:22,131 --> 07:33:27,827
168. One know that you got to that is

2505
07:33:27,827 --> 07:33:35,018
the IP address of of control and then

2506
07:33:35,018 --> 07:33:38,698
going to say in the pa the pod

2507
07:33:41,064 --> 07:33:46,502
Network right CDI Stadium

2508
07:33:46,502 --> 07:33:54,226
and and that is 192.168

2509
07:33:54,935 --> 07:34:01,808
. 12080 or whatever / 17

2510
07:34:01,809 --> 07:34:05,643
that allows it there and let me know out
over that

2511
07:34:05,643 --> 07:34:11,046
I want should be off so I don't really need
to check that but it should be off

2512
07:34:11,046 --> 07:34:18,476
you take a minute seems happy so far view my
checks

2513
07:34:20,840 --> 07:34:27,496
asking for images of the internet's I guess
it's fine

2514
07:34:28,893 --> 07:34:31,413
and

2515
07:34:35,512 --> 07:34:42,118
we are Keen to complain Aztec pods from
directory

2516
07:34:44,853 --> 07:34:50,476
and thenthat looks happy

2517
07:34:50,927 --> 07:34:53,759
alright so let's do a join from here

2518
07:34:55,020 --> 07:35:08,023
that we should be able to join without the
without the Calico stuff going way back we
have to because we're getting a bunch of
Calico seeing I probably have to have keep
Roxy running which is not I don't think it's
running right now

2519
07:35:08,203 --> 07:35:13,200
so we have to do this I think it's safe to
say

2520
07:35:15,208 --> 07:35:16,845
and put it on there

2521
07:35:19,753 --> 07:35:26,583
wait for AccuWeather from Taylor Swift that
looks healthy so far yep that works

2522
07:35:27,819 --> 07:35:35,261
that was happy let's go sell this one a
token

2523
07:35:38,479 --> 07:35:44,773
but this joint down here yeah

2524
07:35:45,190 --> 07:35:55,206
and I got to keep reminding myself the
reason we can do that is because you keep
proxy takes care of all the communication it
warm with you perhaps you would be no
communicating whatsoever with those notes

2525
07:35:55,503 --> 07:36:00,342
and so cute proxy manages all the network
communication

2526
07:36:00,822 --> 07:36:05,423
add some sort of like foundational level
that allows

2527
07:36:06,466 --> 07:36:14,292
I know a lot of cute of communities to
operate and we didn't have that you couldn't
use

2528
07:36:14,738 --> 07:36:31,017
you couldn't deploy Calico as whatever we're
doing we could do it if it wasn't already
some some some pain with urination
everything is already working and so why is
that important to me that's important
because there's multiple

2529
07:36:31,576 --> 07:36:49,136
you know networks involved in kubernetes and
getting my head around what is talking to
what in the promoters of a network
perspective is really great for visualizing
how coronavirus is is is doing its thing
internally

2530
07:36:49,138 --> 07:37:33,429
and and we were we're getting a bag of feel
like I'm getting a better handle on that so
we can have all this communication has all
taking place over the API server and it's
just all you know I makes Services work
that's it right it just makes Services work
and services are 10.98 stuff right and and
then and then pick up until this point until
we install Calico the only way anything
communication the cluster as far as I know
right now is 3 a p i e server by talking
initiating a connection to the external
192168. Yes 6443 thing or over the services
network is which is what keep Roxie runs

2531
07:37:33,433 --> 07:37:40,729
which is on 10.98 right I think and and
after that

2532
07:37:41,822 --> 07:38:26,500
you have when you put Calphalon it's like
that that's when you have to set up a
different network and that's what we do with
our patr Network CID CID R because that says
okay I'll go here you go here is your
network go use this so that additional
Network as is being used by just a pot just
deposit communicate between each other that
includes do you know us internal DNS within
the cluster is a replica set it's a pods
employment which means that is running as
upon which is a finite unit cube rocks is
used to be an owl coffee and Billy really

2533
07:38:26,504 --> 07:38:30,377
wow that's an interesting

2534
07:38:30,552 --> 07:38:38,397
yeah I mean this just really makes me want
to go look at it look internal you know
everything at some point but

2535
07:38:38,477 --> 07:38:41,448
I can't get pods

2536
07:38:41,448 --> 07:38:48,303
08 yeah not that we do all this so I'm
actually getting kind of good at this part

2537
07:38:48,304 --> 07:38:54,175
it was an actual proxy hence the name yeah

2538
07:38:55,477 --> 07:39:00,662
it's all I've been able to write PS Now is
it really

2539
07:39:00,681 --> 07:39:06,838
so so it's you know what that explains why
we had our problems on our internal Network

2540
07:39:07,558 --> 07:39:13,376
yeah yeah

2541
07:39:15,737 --> 07:39:21,277
I tell you what that's when we started
having all kinds of problems in our cluster

2542
07:39:21,848 --> 07:39:27,565
you know it's the statement that you just
said about cute proxy depending on the
underlying

2543
07:39:29,421 --> 07:39:33,670
yeah it's what I'm saying

2544
07:39:34,570 --> 07:39:40,342
if if they switched off at being an actual
proxy to starting to use the underlying
iptables

2545
07:39:40,621 --> 07:39:45,332
that's a fucking disaster if if you're a
structure team fux with iptables

2546
07:39:45,827 --> 07:39:49,977
because they can they can totally fucked up
your kubernetes cluster and not even know it

2547
07:39:51,176 --> 07:40:01,815
and I actually feel like that's exactly what
happened earlier in the year they like two
months of outages they were really really
hard to identify they were related to armpit
shoes

2548
07:40:04,557 --> 07:40:09,403
Custer Siva clusters yeah

2549
07:40:10,719 --> 07:40:17,111
haha that's super interesting pass
completion

2550
07:40:19,752 --> 07:40:27,453
bash completion 08 you see killed Mash no
ATM

2551
07:40:44,861 --> 07:40:50,960
what the hell explore Cube config

2552
07:41:37,909 --> 07:41:42,747
I'll know you would recompile all the rules
if you and cry oh my God

2553
07:41:54,014 --> 07:41:59,760
yeah I thought Colonel that's crazy

2554
07:42:03,455 --> 07:42:06,850
my phone was painful because he likes yes

2555
07:42:10,672 --> 07:42:15,745
ATL hip pain

2556
07:42:16,851 --> 07:42:19,844
best vacuum system

2557
07:42:20,824 --> 07:42:29,772
so there's a Cardenas it's pending cuz we
not Calico we can still talk to everything
though keep Roxy's up and CDs up

2558
07:42:32,649 --> 07:42:43,645
answer that because you are a Calico install
which is RC and I for the pods it's just so
the pods can communicate with each other
they can't currently

2559
07:42:43,700 --> 07:42:51,765
and went to pull right off the internet
without even checking it is a CVS so it's
relatively assured we're going to get the
right thing

2560
07:42:51,929 --> 07:42:58,323
this is straight from the community stocks
and

2561
07:43:00,108 --> 07:43:05,314
we should be seeing stuff happen here

2562
07:43:09,917 --> 07:43:12,957
we should see the pot initializing

2563
07:43:13,776 --> 07:43:18,239
and hopefully it will do the right thing

2564
07:43:19,014 --> 07:43:26,068
it's now running which is good yeah and and
after it runs

2565
07:43:26,405 --> 07:43:33,346
if it if it if it fails after here oh oh
it's working fix everything

2566
07:43:33,346 --> 07:43:39,671
huzzah 2% done thinking Ellet

2567
07:43:40,168 --> 07:43:43,222
is this going to be a flood of YouTube nope

2568
07:43:44,944 --> 07:43:53,160
no I don't do that you can watch my bought
on Twitch but at some point I'll come back
and redo this stuff

2569
07:43:53,949 --> 07:43:59,651
we have a running race cluster and all I had
to do was the join

2570
07:43:59,652 --> 07:44:05,008
two notes while you can yeah it's on Twitch

2571
07:44:05,063 --> 07:44:08,309
it's a look if you guys are afraid about us
recreating

2572
07:44:07,606 --> 07:44:26,102
is recreating the steps don't worry it's all
documented here and you know if you I'm
going to be making videos at some point this
is already on his that all right so this
Saturday we're going to kick off

2573
07:44:26,377 --> 07:44:38,201
the last remaining six weeks is going to be
very informal and we have normally will have
10 weeks to do the containers of grenades
boost but we're going to try it again

2574
07:44:41,149 --> 07:45:03,038
and yeah I mean you know imagine being able
to you know added a bunch of like a people
together right and just hear everything they
have to say I can't wait it rather than a
second brain it would be like it would
literally behind mines is like yours on the
notes of having and be able to just reading
a time if you did that to me is like the
perfect possible thing hey welcome

2575
07:45:03,276 --> 07:45:04,821
so

2576
07:45:05,301 --> 07:45:13,838
so when we got here we have a working
communities that actually works with zero
hitches

2577
07:45:14,441 --> 07:45:20,677
perfect I'm so proud of that can't get pods

2578
07:45:22,898 --> 07:45:25,116
it was loaded too easy

2579
07:45:26,432 --> 07:45:30,909
this is a little bit too easy I don't think
that's a great one

2580
07:45:35,094 --> 07:45:40,556
oh God yeah rain people on specialties

2581
07:45:42,010 --> 07:45:46,129
yeah oh yeah exactly we can make our own
thing

2582
07:45:49,092 --> 07:46:04,692
now it don't unfortunately lvg we can't say
definitively that it was a network overlap I
strongly believe it was it could also have
been I just did shit in the wrong order the
based on the fact that it was related to
networking

2583
07:46:04,742 --> 07:46:23,462
I strongly believe you were right and it was
the overlapping IP addresses because that
was the only thing that was the only thing
that was different from from the last time
we did this the only thing different is the
allocation of IP addresses and I I want to
believe that that was the problem

2584
07:46:23,464 --> 07:46:26,635
so note to self

2585
07:46:26,635 --> 07:46:37,652
you know Thou shalt not overlap your
Hardware machine IP addresses with your pod
container Network

2586
07:46:38,718 --> 07:46:41,185
bad things will happen

2587
07:46:42,074 --> 07:46:49,787
you know that's exactly what happened yes

2588
07:46:49,787 --> 07:46:55,218
yeah it says here we go we got

2589
07:46:55,314 --> 07:47:03,618
I mean we're up we're up I don't know what
to say right now it's times like breaking
shit right so

2590
07:47:03,730 --> 07:47:10,535
I mean he'll wear it like totally up I think
for even port forwarding

2591
07:47:13,807 --> 07:47:16,654
I think we might be port forwarding

2592
07:47:24,108 --> 07:47:30,897
can't get that say all so here's everything
in the cluster of God

2593
07:47:31,275 --> 07:47:39,225
all right so you're going to read that I'm
sorry because of the chat but here's
everything in the coaster

2594
07:47:39,543 --> 07:47:47,178
every single little thing why is calico no
doing it's a good thing again or those old
one

2595
07:47:47,178 --> 07:48:41,746
alright a scare me so we got we got in
Calico which provides our container network
interface that's the the pods can talk to
each other over the specified IP range which
by default as when I too. 168. 0. 0 / 16 I'm
I'm saying this to myself because I know you
know reflective learning hear the cubes
proxy which Brokers communication over
iptables between all of the machines on the
network which are that would be actually no
that's different than the machines
themselves so we just sshd in right when we
have to Stage those the machines are
connected via the 192. 168. Two. Two. Two.
Three. Two nights for theirs theirs is a
static IP said they were assigned

2596
07:48:41,752 --> 07:48:48,595
and they have up to 128 I am 2,000 machines
if you want to cuz we

2597
07:48:47,331 --> 07:49:08,658
she's we want to cuz we split and we split
the the one I don't want 68.0 Network men so
that's why I thought that's what we had to
do a separate pidro pod and then the two
proxies are communicating with Services /
10. 98. 0

2598
07:49:08,894 --> 07:49:11,655
on / 16 right

2599
07:49:11,952 --> 07:49:18,931
Ukraine ssa-44 yeah yeah we could you at
some point

2600
07:49:18,931 --> 07:49:43,596
we were going to do that actually we're
going to put up we're going to put an SSH I
was going to set up cuz I mean if you want
to set up an actual race cluster I really
think you need to setup SSH access remote
control plane to your notes to your note
host machines because because how we going
to get on there and do you know this is c a
r i c t l or whatever you need to do to do
to do bugget tenda 96/16 right

2601
07:49:43,819 --> 07:49:55,965
I got that right 96/16 is what all the
services are on my default i18n 168 / 16 is
the default Network for the pods

2602
07:52:57,777 --> 07:53:04,255
yeah you company I work for has its own
class A address fruition 7

2603
07:53:06,497 --> 07:53:12,271
IP address yes his face face a

2604
07:53:12,843 --> 07:53:15,083
yeah

2605
07:53:17,879 --> 07:53:22,119
listen. 96 is just one of them yeah

2606
07:53:24,482 --> 07:53:28,580
I know it's only one of them that you have
to like get around it so I'm trying to say

2607
07:53:29,754 --> 07:53:36,889
hitting the reason I thought it was because
I it makes sense for us to make the vagrant
machines on the 10. Address

2608
07:53:37,560 --> 07:54:22,687
write up anyone that I put on the 168
Network because yeah that's the same as my
internal but it makes more sense to put them
on a $10 for going to simulate an enterprise
Enterprise the chances of you having an
internal address on the 10. Range is going
to be very high if you were here for a large
Enterprise almost every Enterprise I've ever
seen runs on the 10th on our internally so
if you get what I'm trying to get at is if
you want your vagrant yeah right that's what
I was just getting that so so if you want
your if you want your internal if you want
your vagrant set up to feel Enterprises in
after you can bring over the SSH anything
and there's really no distinction between an
actual Enterprise machine then use a tendon
address

2609
07:54:22,695 --> 07:54:42,743
and if we do that then we don't have to
split the the you know the / 17 CR you are
on the 192 168 because we can just we can
keep everything he's at fault and so that
would even be more intuitive for people just
beginning me I kind of like that we're
writing it out you know just cause but it's
not needed right because it's his fault

2610
07:54:42,747 --> 07:54:52,078
so I think I think I'm going to make that
change right now since we got everything to
work then make sure to save everything cuz
this way works

2611
07:54:52,740 --> 07:54:54,438
yeah

2612
07:54:56,644 --> 07:55:11,168
he's 24 for all your private notes if you're
doing that then how do you how do you run
Community Center as well I have a question
so is the 10. Address rain inside of
kubernetes

2613
07:55:11,427 --> 07:55:17,974
nat it away from everything else it seems
like the answer to that is no

2614
07:55:21,127 --> 07:55:25,843
set up 43 very cute controller

2615
07:55:27,261 --> 07:55:35,254
starseed Terraria 1042 traffic to 43
interesting

2616
07:55:35,398 --> 07:55:39,277
so you actually changed yours right

2617
07:55:39,277 --> 07:55:44,439
Porsche it sounds like you did that right
now

2618
07:55:44,440 --> 07:55:50,076
is it being out of communities doesn't call
for it but it's best practice right

2619
07:55:50,554 --> 07:55:54,477
right so there's there's really

2620
07:55:54,994 --> 07:56:03,290
when people draw like a box around their
kubernetes cluster that's just a line on a
piece of paper

2621
07:56:03,786 --> 07:56:13,345
the only thing that's really keeps your
kubernetes cluster together if you're not
mad at me like that would be IP assignment

2622
07:56:13,351 --> 07:56:19,507
you know and yeah

2623
07:56:19,508 --> 07:56:22,397
GPS says 3 cast

2624
07:56:22,397 --> 07:56:27,572
yeah the secondary PCS Andres thing

2625
07:56:28,219 --> 07:56:32,457
for account well

2626
07:56:34,418 --> 07:56:41,386
secondary onesies hundred. Interesting

2627
07:56:42,156 --> 07:56:48,105
so since it has so so I think so

2628
07:56:48,106 --> 07:56:53,719
I mean we have a few considerations or one
of them is that

2629
07:56:54,452 --> 07:57:03,553
virtualbox already assumes at 10. Not an IP
address as a default in fact we found out it
was 1:50 or something what was it

2630
07:57:03,890 --> 07:57:12,112
I mean I'm trying to get two and a happy
alternative for testing it for starting out
in for beginners that I could use him
something that

2631
07:57:12,112 --> 07:57:16,073
oh wow how's it going out of this building

2632
07:57:18,737 --> 07:57:22,808
so it's a Sim saying if we have like

2633
07:57:27,604 --> 07:57:34,044
little ones are dead they're dead Jim
they're dead

2634
07:57:34,538 --> 07:57:40,615
at work who is the doctor who is the doctor
not

2635
07:57:43,938 --> 07:57:50,582
I said 10. Right why isn't it saying here I
guess I might have to go to hatch

2636
07:58:00,199 --> 07:58:07,329
so right so this is a default virtualbox IP
address right that's a fucking 24

2637
07:58:11,235 --> 07:58:15,037
oh nevermind nevermind that that's just
right here right

2638
07:58:15,466 --> 07:58:19,617
I got it backwards if you got it scared me
to death

2639
07:58:20,379 --> 07:58:30,183
yes I didn't get ready to take you for a day
out of this ability welcome welcome welcome
all your crazy welcome to the crazy

2640
07:58:30,998 --> 07:58:37,640
I know what the fuck are we doing right we
love having people visit

2641
07:58:42,650 --> 07:58:50,470
epso a24 wait a second

2642
07:58:53,864 --> 07:58:59,224
yeah we definitely have it over and overlap
that was the problem we had an overlap

2643
07:59:01,921 --> 07:59:08,886
Note 3 and 4 yeah yeah I think that's what
we'll do and then and then nobody's going to
nobody can touch that

2644
07:59:09,226 --> 07:59:11,056
can't touch this

2645
07:59:12,689 --> 07:59:25,001
we passed the part that we're cadres and we
made sure that the subnets were not
overlapping also weary you know did
everything we had to do a medium in it and a
joint and it was done

2646
07:59:25,112 --> 07:59:49,065
so I don't play around right now it is
unfortunately we're not come we can't say
with 100% of surety that the problem was the
overlapping eyepiece we can't say that
sleepy you no way it could have been that I
did something out of water in it but it did
all the indicators seem to be that was it
because it was never provided and was weird
and stuff so

2647
07:59:49,951 --> 07:59:53,456
I'm getting at here is

2648
07:59:54,148 --> 08:00:33,483
I think what we need to do just because if I
if I'm going to explain this to somebody
else I'm not going to have to tell him about
the other IP stuff right I want to be able
to just assume the default I want to
memorize it a false and I want to know about
the are you are I mean upon us or to see how
you are but I don't necessarily want to have
to live in that level with that level of
paranoia I think if we do 10:00. The only
problem with this if I had any other devices
on my network which I doubt I do everything
on the 10. Now we're carrying $10 is pretty
in a pretty broad but I I like that I think
I think I want to use this from now on you
are one is obviously the router

2649
08:00:33,491 --> 08:00:40,164
usually so we don't want. And and and and
and and

2650
08:00:41,258 --> 08:00:44,141
and I'm going to I'm going to go for them

2651
08:00:45,744 --> 08:00:52,674
if that works we really should not have to
do this year yourself

2652
08:00:56,585 --> 08:01:02,809
and if necessary and I mean

2653
08:01:02,811 --> 08:01:07,272
we should be able to do this only

2654
08:01:08,049 --> 08:01:17,185
and unbeatable it the only reason we're
doing that is because we wanted to know was
real the join to be able to go into the
right if you had

2655
08:01:17,185 --> 08:01:24,639
all right so I'm going to try this get diff

2656
08:01:27,002 --> 08:01:34,404
update advertise address yesterday I thought
I just did it today not do it

2657
08:01:36,504 --> 08:01:42,029
you know what is dropping this because if we
did the old one

2658
08:01:42,029 --> 08:01:48,052
and this is before I just laying here so 10.
0. 0

2659
08:01:48,053 --> 08:01:52,441
it's a lot to Ocean

2660
08:01:53,946 --> 08:02:00,130
get diff yeah we got the

2661
08:02:00,130 --> 08:02:03,598
thank you ready shell is now loaded

2662
08:02:04,257 --> 08:02:08,414
yep I think we're good to go so

2663
08:02:20,655 --> 08:02:21,770
no

2664
08:02:44,579 --> 08:02:57,092
all right and if you think we're dumping
this this might be the end of the day today
I need to bring storage Quest tomorrow at
all day probably early tonight

2665
08:02:58,652 --> 08:03:06,163
I don't know I feel like I should still keep
going with this I need to get to the point
where I'm at a storage classes with the end
of fast and we provisioned

2666
08:03:06,424 --> 08:03:10,875
that I need to do that I need to figure out
how to do that. So I got to get that done
like right away

2667
08:03:13,065 --> 08:03:21,747
nice places to go out faster this morning
but whatever I learned a fuck ton so

2668
08:03:23,420 --> 08:03:30,931
vagrant destroy or do we just see if they
could do a Reload I think we can do a Reload

2669
08:03:31,753 --> 08:03:35,336
I think we have to do I think we have to do
to destroy right

2670
08:03:38,737 --> 08:03:46,244
I don't know can we do a Reload and we'll
have it will pull down anyway message I will
try to restart the service

2671
08:03:52,933 --> 08:04:00,227

08:04:24,110 --> 08:04:26,300

2675
08:04:31,261 --> 08:04:34,545
because of that cuz the IP stuff is not
going to work right

2676
08:04:37,524 --> 08:04:41,214
did they get stored in and it's Annette. Do

I see and then

2693
08:06:57,484 --> 08:07:07,717
I see and then the reload is going to do it
without because it was going to throw out

2733
08:13:04,694 --> 08:13:10,879
Cube admin ATM Dash

2734
08:13:11,363 --> 08:13:17,753
dash if you're a server advertise

2735
08:13:17,873 --> 08:13:23,947
address is 10. 0. 0. 2

2736
08:13:24,768 --> 08:13:31,007

08:13:32,006 --> 08:13:37,580
there we go that's looks good

2738
08:13:45,783 --> 08:13:53,635
SSH into node one Ascension 2

2739
08:13:57,239 --> 08:14:01,698
okie dokie now here comes the magic

2740
08:14:01,855 --> 08:14:08,542
set W sink pains on are you ready are you
ready for the magic

2741
08:14:09,770 --> 08:14:11,625
that's right

2742
08:14:13,865 --> 08:14:20,882
how many CPUs do we have I'm sure you want
to know and proc will tell you we have two
seat fuse on control

2743
08:14:21,033 --> 08:14:30,594
2 horse whenever we have one here and one
here how much memory do we have on them I'm
sure you want to ask 3-8

2744
08:14:30,716 --> 08:14:38,124
yeah I'm going to gig on each she's actually
too big and no swapswap cell turned off

2745
08:14:38,511 --> 08:14:44,176
there is no swap and we are now able to join

2746
08:14:44,610 --> 08:14:49,965
our stuff I forgot my drink man though I got
to get it into ATM

2747
08:14:50,829 --> 08:14:55,145
join god dammit

2748
08:14:58,262 --> 08:15:06,070
I forgot to join game and I am sorry but you
can print it out if you need forgot to get a
new one

2749
08:15:06,070 --> 08:15:09,255
it's actually token something

2750
08:15:12,387 --> 08:15:17,227
comedian token that says join

2751
08:15:17,398 --> 08:15:21,634
create create Prince

2752
08:15:23,761 --> 08:15:28,942
join there we go

2753
08:15:29,755 --> 08:15:33,844
all right now is copy this over here

2754
08:15:40,599 --> 08:15:48,593
and then this one right here going to do a
crossover that's okay

2755
08:15:51,144 --> 08:15:54,604
and then there's a b at the end

2756
08:15:54,607 --> 08:16:00,642
now that should join the join that's on the
control plane should be automatic

2757
08:16:05,178 --> 08:16:07,861
so we should be fine

2758
08:16:08,343 --> 08:16:13,588
watch both our systems joint at the same
time

2759
08:16:17,058 --> 08:16:22,704
actually we canactually we can set up all of
our completion on each 12 kind of

2760
08:16:24,807 --> 08:16:32,320
and we can't and I can't because this is
your friend Adam in file for Q-See field I'm
going to turn my thing off

2761
08:16:37,145 --> 08:16:44,641
so now what now we do I mean

2762
08:16:47,641 --> 08:16:54,466
Q-See tell completion Bash and I need a cube
c t l

2763
08:16:55,916 --> 08:17:02,091
tab tab get notes to episodes the hello

2764
08:17:02,619 --> 08:17:10,083
x 4 Cube config equals at Sakura Nettie's
admin

2765
08:17:10,452 --> 08:17:17,120
and then get knowing there's our notes and
look our notes are ready

2766
08:17:17,760 --> 08:17:30,730
that's fascinating this is somebody was
talking about this last time our nose are
not supposed to be ready you know why
they're ready because there's stuff still in
at CNET. Too even though it's fucked up is
lying to us

2767
08:17:31,316 --> 08:17:38,111
are not answering it to you whatever it is
it's actually lying this is a lie I'm
telling you it's a lie

2768
08:17:38,984 --> 08:17:55,285
it's falsely ready yeah it's not good
somebody was saying that it showed ready and
then they were confused that's because we
still haven't installed the the Pod thing
but it kind of thinks it's there but it's
not so you have to go you have to go do the
Calico install

2769
08:17:56,857 --> 08:17:59,651
and that I have here

2770
08:18:01,949 --> 08:18:09,591
so let's do this on it anywhere that's got
to keep CDL control access

2771
08:18:09,666 --> 08:18:19,986
it does not Envy in Cube system so I don't
even think we need to have you in the right
context I think we have to set the namespace
contacts I think it just works

2772
08:18:20,717 --> 08:18:24,734
mostly because I think it's cute sea tale by
the fault was probably look at that

2773
08:18:25,936 --> 08:18:32,758
Adidas pants gets pods

2774
08:18:41,662 --> 08:18:49,359
I mean that they're still stuck reading the
containers I just wish they all veggie do
you think

2775
08:18:53,520 --> 08:18:58,011
so before they weren't in that state they
were in sort of a different state

2776
08:18:58,166 --> 08:19:04,569
yeah that's that's It's Curious it's very
curious

2777
08:19:10,095 --> 08:19:16,430
36 of those already. A62 knows already but
it's not

2778
08:19:16,793 --> 08:19:26,716
I mean that I'm this entire thing just for
discovering that kind of disagreement from
reality is worth it just that one little
thing

2779
08:19:27,734 --> 08:19:35,146
so and an hour to do

2780
08:19:35,370 --> 08:19:41,959
watch GigaParts can you system

2781
08:19:42,215 --> 08:19:49,764
fuck we did it only for communities

2782
08:19:51,073 --> 08:19:53,276
alrighty

2783
08:20:02,072 --> 08:20:05,734
running running running

2784
08:20:10,581 --> 08:20:15,263
I don't know this is taking longer than
usual

2785
08:20:17,214 --> 08:20:23,233
I want that we fuck up what did I look up

2786
08:20:23,752 --> 08:20:31,686
when it for you to give you a better I
wonder if it says some configuration stuff
in there somewhere

2787
08:20:36,793 --> 08:20:43,096
is because a Calico Q controllers aren't the
neither

2788
08:20:43,097 --> 08:20:47,348
I want to see what's happening

2789
08:20:58,661 --> 08:20:59,662
oh

2790
08:21:10,577 --> 08:21:12,954
how do they all have the same IP address

2791
08:21:19,849 --> 08:21:21,877
it doesn't make any sense

2792
08:21:26,443 --> 08:21:33,329
you know what it we dropped it I dropped the
p i t r i mean apart and server cidr I think
he needs it

2793
08:21:37,306 --> 08:21:42,803
Neff doesn't how to select interface cuz we
didn't tell it

2794
08:21:43,985 --> 08:21:49,507
so note to self you cannot drop

2795
08:21:52,200 --> 08:22:04,455
accent like that we're going to do a reset
again tonight so I'm going after all the
reset this is again repetition repetition
reputation repetition of a Play hack the box
I break my systems

2796
08:22:06,485 --> 08:22:08,771
edit Damon said Calico node

2797
08:22:09,226 --> 08:22:17,339
you want to fix it you and you're a Fix-It I
first of all I want to make sure that I get
this line right

2798
08:22:17,720 --> 08:22:23,986
right must I must I screwed up next time so
it's

2799
08:22:24,748 --> 08:22:31,969
server or network network cidr

2800
08:22:33,246 --> 08:22:40,214
10. No we're supposed to be 192 why didn't
you pick up the default

2801
08:22:43,827 --> 08:22:47,185
someone tell me why I didn't use the default
like I supposed to

2802
08:22:47,934 --> 08:22:53,262
I'm kind of pissed in the whole time I was I
was sold

2803
08:22:53,812 --> 08:22:59,245
the hopefully that was really going to
simplify that right we renew 192.168

2804
08:22:59,245 --> 08:23:04,859
add 0. 0 / 16 which is the default

2805
08:23:05,000 --> 08:23:07,765
but it didn't use the default

2806
08:23:08,432 --> 08:23:18,405
so the reason they keep putting a series
that they're like a Yoshi and I might
actually need this thing I apparently Calico
needs it so

2807
08:23:19,410 --> 08:23:26,787
even though that's the default it's a Calico
kind of miss you alrighty well

2808
08:23:28,152 --> 08:23:34,231
that's just on every single one right I
guess Cube

2809
08:23:34,653 --> 08:23:38,287
God damn it I have to do all that shit again

2810
08:23:38,306 --> 08:23:42,890
Patrol don't need this I don't need this

2811
08:23:43,166 --> 08:23:50,620
cigarettes Sea-Doo

2812
08:23:51,442 --> 08:23:53,792
I just said again

2813
08:23:58,491 --> 08:24:05,269
I didn't mean repetition Maybe repetition is
good

2814
08:24:23,982 --> 08:24:26,374
alright so

2815
08:24:27,969 --> 08:24:33,939
okay get ice and keep system

2816
08:24:34,658 --> 08:24:39,430
forgot and think it worked

2817
08:24:40,198 --> 08:24:44,426
oh I'm stupid I'm stupid

2818
08:24:48,019 --> 08:24:55,243
8. This is what I want to get memorize to so

2819
08:24:56,259 --> 08:25:01,427
config set contacts

2820
08:25:12,723 --> 08:25:15,847
no queue system

2821
08:25:20,775 --> 08:25:27,040
alright so okay edit

2822
08:25:27,040 --> 08:25:35,012
Damon said Calico good thing I know VI

2823
08:25:35,536 --> 08:25:43,032
and I didn't stick with and I didn't force
myself to learn emacs and I'm not learning
commission U of M shit

2824
08:25:43,554 --> 08:25:48,654
I just have to put that in there and go to
EnV

2825
08:25:51,938 --> 08:25:53,351
God damn

2826
08:26:00,315 --> 08:26:06,946
so it's the damage that you you study the
Calico damn is it actually I'm impressed

2827
08:26:07,541 --> 08:26:09,431
I'm impressed

2828
08:26:15,589 --> 08:26:18,642
he's do I got a text or nothing. Equals

2829
08:26:22,552 --> 08:26:25,997
we can't do the full $24 cuz we used all of
it

2830
08:26:29,410 --> 08:26:35,972
I think you're confusing your your stuff I
don't think we can do that

2831
08:26:40,226 --> 08:26:47,073
are we supposed to put the 1927 there when I
say 168 stuff right

2832
08:26:47,997 --> 08:26:52,620
that we reserve the 10.0 addresses for all
the hardware or is this the hardware thing

2833
08:26:54,623 --> 08:26:58,590
so tell him to use the interface that has
the network

2834
08:27:02,930 --> 08:27:06,297
she said her face was has a network meaning
of that

2835
08:27:10,699 --> 08:27:17,427
so it'll detected it and then it'll put the
other stuff in there interesting okay

2836
08:27:17,922 --> 08:27:24,359
I know I would have known this one IP Auto
detection

2837
08:27:25,055 --> 08:27:27,320
the Calico thing huh

2838
08:27:39,354 --> 08:27:41,927
I got a detection method

2839
08:27:45,800 --> 08:27:47,610
value

2840
08:27:51,594 --> 08:27:56,220
as a weird Hero 6 at you soon officials I
was going to say so

2841
08:27:56,545 --> 08:28:10,465
it must have been a messed pick the
interface was going to run on but then it
has two is still has to set the 192
addresses or that's that's that's that's a
different thing it's going for something by
default that's totally different right so

2842
08:28:10,466 --> 08:28:15,028
all right I hear you I just seems very odd

2843
08:28:23,004 --> 08:28:29,738
is that this was a mistake I was not valid
Fountain Valley

2844
08:28:33,074 --> 08:28:36,161
you know why because the fucking

2845
08:28:39,424 --> 08:28:43,184
as afraid of that I was afraid of that

2846
08:28:49,190 --> 08:28:51,674
fucking tabs

2847
08:29:12,461 --> 08:29:19,801
oh my God it actually looks for the IP
ranges and then figure out what interface
based on the numbers

2848
08:29:20,549 --> 08:29:23,841
shit that's horrible

2849
08:29:24,120 --> 08:29:31,857
so are you telling me that is setting the
saying the same thing the Pod network cidr
is not going to fix this is it

2850
08:29:31,909 --> 08:29:39,899
is that going to fix it nope so I'm going to
have to do something like this

2851
08:29:42,846 --> 08:29:47,118
well I get the first two I try to not think
about

2852
08:29:56,121 --> 08:29:58,839
let me have to delete those are they

2853
08:30:05,083 --> 08:30:10,869
fuck you fuck you and your non Alias is this
is why I hate aliases

2854
08:30:14,219 --> 08:30:20,276
hair braiding well that nose all that nose
running we ever sell the OneNote this
morning

2855
08:30:22,241 --> 08:30:26,307
if I did it right if you need to restart
something

2856
08:30:28,927 --> 08:30:35,023
that is really fucked up I Calico thing I
need to read all the docks for Calico

2857
08:30:40,765 --> 08:30:44,389
this is the control plane

2858
08:30:46,711 --> 08:30:48,958
are they supposed to do it on the other one

2859
08:30:59,657 --> 08:31:01,168
one second ago

2860
08:31:06,637 --> 08:31:12,316
if you didn't take yeah.

2861
08:31:16,686 --> 08:31:18,824
IAH developer how are you

2862
08:31:27,657 --> 08:31:35,647
and I know I would have thought it would
have changed her wait we have to wait for
the refresh your old do you think I have to
force the delete or the rolling restart on
the pods

2863
08:31:36,331 --> 08:31:42,729
I'm kind of thinking I might need to what do
you think

2864
08:31:45,631 --> 08:31:50,978
I think you need to really restart the pods
Brazilian

2865
08:31:57,941 --> 08:31:59,620
k

2866
08:32:05,411 --> 08:32:07,329
here we go again

2867
08:32:21,508 --> 08:32:23,071
and Evan

2868
08:32:28,844 --> 08:32:35,443
oh it's pretty good it's been educational if
nothing else where to go to

2869
08:32:38,817 --> 08:32:46,516
or is it for a log Calico

2870
08:32:49,217 --> 08:32:55,762
cni containers

2871
08:33:04,954 --> 08:33:06,751
oh shit

2872
08:33:15,456 --> 08:33:21,722
Calico node

2873
08:33:28,278 --> 08:33:30,274
that was fast

2874
08:33:38,879 --> 08:33:45,890
migration Alyssa Calico FM complete I know I
found directory

2875
08:33:46,350 --> 08:33:52,212
that's what you might do stuff this little
stuff since

2876
08:34:01,068 --> 08:34:05,285
yeah sfm stock

2877
08:34:08,588 --> 08:34:17,035
Cube system Calico whatever yeah I'm just
getting to the thing down

2878
08:34:19,090 --> 08:34:25,963
Les Calico node Calico node

2879
08:34:35,570 --> 08:34:38,086
I don't have to hear

2880
08:34:42,882 --> 08:34:48,215
Xenia star status and when I get that one

2881
08:35:03,334 --> 08:35:07,835
Hey look can't talk to 1096

2882
08:35:09,142 --> 08:35:12,918
700 problems again same time is it for

2883
08:35:14,287 --> 08:35:20,426
I want to thank that Calico actually cares
about the pods Services supposed acacian

2884
08:35:20,881 --> 08:35:26,040
this isn't a thing to do with it I know it
is like but it's not work related right

2885
08:35:34,346 --> 08:35:35,621
interesting

2886
08:35:41,053 --> 08:35:47,707
if I can't talk to the services is it
because we put everything else on the 10.
Network and now we have a conflict I think
that's it

2887
08:35:48,906 --> 08:35:55,715
we do I think we have a I think we have a

2888
08:35:57,168 --> 08:36:02,230
I also I also think it will look this is 10.
0. 96 right

2889
08:36:03,051 --> 08:36:11,255
so if those networks are physically
connected isn't isn't setting our 10. No.
No. No. 24/24 is that an overlap

2890
08:36:12,163 --> 08:36:15,250
hey I got it going been exhausting

2891
08:36:16,550 --> 08:36:22,646
I sent it 96 and we did tell her okay you
got me you got me on that one okay

2892
08:36:22,964 --> 08:36:33,223
Highway 24 all right that's fine yeah it's
2424 is just the last week right that's
Tuesday 5 to 5:20.

2893
08:36:34,560 --> 08:36:40,016
All right I'll make sense so that's not it I
think it is I think it is the CID our stuff

2894
08:36:40,096 --> 08:36:47,679
there's when I throw this away

2895
08:36:49,049 --> 08:36:54,938
I got a whole thing with Labs I just decided
to have a repo and if you're right about
that

2896
08:36:56,322 --> 08:37:02,798
excited at the marathon. This is a new thing
I'm going to try to recommend

2897
08:37:03,313 --> 08:37:05,854
yeah goodnight Brioni

2898
08:37:07,227 --> 08:37:12,131
can reset again and remove myself or I can
just destroy and try it all over again

2899
08:37:12,132 --> 08:37:15,885
yeah no problem I just wanted to let you
know that

2900
08:37:21,384 --> 08:37:26,937
is consolidating these and

2901
08:37:28,646 --> 08:37:32,370
I did a thing on important Repose you should
have

2902
08:37:34,456 --> 08:37:39,672
yeah I mean the other way to do it I just
don't know how we're going to do a clean
install

2903
08:37:41,524 --> 08:37:49,541
at the thing I need to think about what
you're doing this is it is if if we didn't
have the ability to reset it like how would
you fix it if you couldn't do that

2904
08:37:49,541 --> 08:37:52,422
right now and you probably be

2905
08:37:52,422 --> 08:38:04,583
you can you can reset and then remove the
Seeing Eye stuff and then go if I couldn't
just blow out the machine which you normally
couldn't do so it's good point

2906
08:38:05,789 --> 08:38:19,162
I want to say agua for you guys I got the
whole idea of like crazy in Temple for lab
and stuff I think we need to move away from
that just have a sandwich single a visit a
place to dump all your notes everything and
then I think your

2907
08:38:19,164 --> 08:38:26,150
I think we need to figure out another way to
write I mean a whole thing of it here

2908
08:38:26,151 --> 08:38:32,346
I don't know if you can see here I mean
since August here I just want to show

2909
08:38:32,346 --> 08:38:36,305
so we need to do

2910
08:38:37,097 --> 08:38:46,706
I think I think when we make a registry were
going to make projects experiments exercises
and tests and bottom line is

2911
08:38:46,706 --> 08:38:53,992
we're going to need to refer to a project or
something like that so that's how we can do
that

2912
08:38:56,119 --> 08:39:01,639
I think the thing works going to write up is
going to be more like the challenges that we
ended up doing

2913
08:39:01,640 --> 08:39:07,885
I think riding the exercise / challenge down
and or the specification for project

2914
08:39:07,886 --> 08:39:15,364
I do those are the things those ideas for
things to do and the badge right so badges
projects

2915
08:39:15,364 --> 08:39:36,588
and exercises such challenges those are the
things that we should that we should create
repositories of and people can go there and
then go find other people's research on a
based on their unique identifiers sooner so
that's I thought about that a lot this
morning when I woke up right so that's um

2916
08:39:36,591 --> 08:39:38,971
let's do this let's dolet's do

2917
08:39:43,260 --> 08:39:46,009
I do how you do

2918
08:39:49,029 --> 08:39:55,839
brexit and just know we need reset
everything right so

2919
08:40:07,444 --> 08:40:14,653
all right and reset

2920
08:40:24,945 --> 08:40:27,316
managing directors of our live

2921
08:40:35,555 --> 08:40:41,039
then what is taking too long

2922
08:40:50,988 --> 08:40:56,917
it doesn't look good this does not look good

2923
08:41:07,276 --> 08:41:11,635
I try to see where is the average elevation
in Enterprise appointment

2924
08:41:15,224 --> 08:41:17,392
even though you going to pay for it

2925
08:41:19,942 --> 08:41:24,202
entrance if you cosplay especially in
machine learning close to where GPS all that
matters

2926
08:41:25,823 --> 08:41:32,455
with me even being able to tweak your here
in points machines this deal is a big deal

2927
08:41:34,046 --> 08:41:38,539
and I just was a physical machine imagine

2928
08:41:47,726 --> 08:41:54,000
mr. Gyros I wonder if we have to know what
if we did

2929
08:41:54,335 --> 08:42:02,037
I'm going to remove everything in seeing eye
right I can get this wrong

2930
08:42:12,966 --> 08:42:20,351
is an entity was it and then it where is it
it's Nets

2931
08:42:22,123 --> 08:42:28,118
far where is it at Dottie

2932
08:42:29,004 --> 08:42:31,196
I was seeing I right

2933
08:42:47,645 --> 08:42:51,822
202 doo doo doo doo

2934
08:42:51,932 --> 08:42:59,627
do do to do to do to to well sir

2935
08:43:00,035 --> 08:43:04,827
I'd rather restarting reload Desiree start
right

2936
08:43:06,546 --> 08:43:08,573
he currently doing

2937
08:43:19,617 --> 08:43:26,051
do what you do do do do do do do I feel

2938
08:43:26,297 --> 08:43:29,085
positive that this is going to work

2939
08:43:42,721 --> 08:43:45,343
I'd rather go to bed what time is it

2940
08:43:51,164 --> 08:43:54,638
hey what my disk drive is making all kinds
of noise

2941
08:44:01,778 --> 08:44:08,225
I want to give me a 32 core threadripper
light Minister Valdez

2942
08:44:08,562 --> 08:44:14,266
I was apologizing cuz this last released he
did from his laptop and he doesn't normally
work from a laptop

2943
08:44:22,230 --> 08:44:23,569
emo

2944
08:44:44,125 --> 08:44:47,718
I mean set up an independent Calico for sure

2945
08:44:49,702 --> 08:45:03,799
I want to see if you have a Calico and do a
deep dive NFS okay so that three main
batteries sets that kubernetes uses that I
need to really get down and dirty with

2946
08:45:03,978 --> 08:45:13,158
is calico for the cni container D or Creo
for the the runtime of your face

2947
08:45:14,254 --> 08:45:15,566
and

2948
08:45:16,435 --> 08:45:23,828
NFS for the storage glass and so we have to
figure out what the preferred storage
classes for an FS

2949
08:45:24,429 --> 08:45:26,808
Anderson is another one we need

2950
08:45:27,558 --> 08:45:46,415
an Ingress I really saw it in your S8 I need
a saw it in your ass and then I needed Salt
and NAD middle of me those are the batteries
that people add to kubernetes because
they're not included I really should
understand this to you as well my fucking
hate is to you

2951
08:45:46,864 --> 08:45:52,819
but have the minister at so we got to know
it Sam

2952
08:45:53,944 --> 08:45:55,797
so are we got

2953
08:45:59,681 --> 08:46:07,084
all right so as to save control c u r s u s

2954
08:46:11,536 --> 08:46:15,707
I don't want to listen to store Scotch just
manually create feces

2955
08:46:15,991 --> 08:46:19,804
so what you going to tell me that there's
another one no that's better or something

2956
08:46:21,700 --> 08:46:28,167
advertise do you want do you want to do this
I don't think we need to do that but it

2957
08:46:30,330 --> 08:46:32,124
what's wrong with that is

2958
08:46:43,920 --> 08:46:50,382
wait what's it going down to Calico stuff

2959
08:46:54,814 --> 08:46:56,944
I think we are right

2960
08:47:18,180 --> 08:47:21,459
cuz I want to change the IVs in at 1

2961
08:47:22,936 --> 08:47:26,276
we had to change IP to Newton at 1

2962
08:47:35,593 --> 08:47:37,591
wait a second

2963
08:47:41,288 --> 08:47:49,021
I thought we would get all the season two
faults I wanted to use the eyepiece of

2964
08:47:52,434 --> 08:47:56,992
yeah but we had a subnet mask that was weird

2965
08:47:59,107 --> 08:48:01,221
so

2966
08:48:03,860 --> 08:48:07,727
it was a spot that when I pee I was trying
to use the defaults

2967
08:48:09,458 --> 08:48:13,209
and so I'm I'm just curious why

2968
08:48:15,487 --> 08:48:18,114
wait

2969
08:48:23,460 --> 08:48:33,230
that I mean the Calico thing I want to
believe that the thing that we're struggling
right now that I'm struggling with is

2970
08:48:33,230 --> 08:48:38,198
is primarily because we didn't set up the

2971
08:48:38,702 --> 08:48:43,300
I didn't set the Pod to pod Network cidr

2972
08:48:43,301 --> 08:48:49,531
because that that's the that was a part of
it I think

2973
08:48:51,620 --> 08:48:57,179
so let's just work another one

2974
08:49:02,507 --> 08:49:04,936
x 4 Cube think

2975
08:49:16,926 --> 08:49:18,496
sending okay

2976
08:49:20,719 --> 08:49:27,854
they're pending or not ready the way they're
supposed to be like that's what we want
right before they were waiting on container
so this is already different

2977
08:49:30,178 --> 08:49:35,799
and the notes themselves yes

2978
08:49:42,855 --> 08:49:50,319
and they're not ready okay so this is
already better right

2979
08:49:51,312 --> 08:49:56,669
so when we haven't had any other changes
whatsoever so far so good

2980
08:49:58,586 --> 08:50:07,053
yeah I know getting a nervous so now we need
to run our cute if you apply it Calico on
here

2981
08:50:07,863 --> 08:50:13,573
I still don't think we need that we're going
to separate that I don't want to I do not
want to do the wrong thing here

2982
08:50:40,335 --> 08:50:42,948
running container creating

2983
08:50:51,055 --> 08:50:54,434
Brandon I didn't join it

2984
08:50:55,514 --> 08:50:59,446
today I did in front of me

2985
08:51:01,098 --> 08:51:04,480
has point on the carrots, taking forever to
download

2986
08:51:11,174 --> 08:51:16,895
or not and I can't download it cuz of that
face

2987
08:51:21,376 --> 08:51:28,984
yeah I like that maybe iptables gets messed
up no

2988
08:51:37,875 --> 08:51:49,142
and I two options we can continue to kind of
work around this and when we can try to
resend you a comedian with the PID with a
beat with a pot server Network

2989
08:51:49,816 --> 08:51:54,235
cuz I could still this is still okay right

2990
08:51:55,901 --> 08:51:58,969
this is still going to be okay

2991
08:51:59,775 --> 08:52:06,415
is it not I wonder if there's like some 10.
Overlap I know we don't know supposed to be

2992
08:52:14,490 --> 08:52:17,378
you know very well

2993
08:52:20,210 --> 08:52:30,930
I wonder if there's some peace baby tables
files that have like regular kids favorite
like writes this stuff they sell that they
weren't loves to write this shit

2994
08:52:30,930 --> 08:52:32,640
so

2995
08:52:37,421 --> 08:52:41,890
that looks like it we got closer but not
quite all the way there

2996
08:52:51,109 --> 08:52:57,487
is Emily network-related whatever it is it's
not work related yeah

2997
08:53:26,427 --> 08:53:28,593
since I'm out

2998
08:53:39,163 --> 08:53:40,700
no access

2999
08:54:09,807 --> 08:54:11,241
but are you

3000
08:54:17,828 --> 08:54:22,963
rise LOL I don't know

3001
08:54:50,954 --> 08:54:58,667
as exactly the same thing whoa

3002
08:55:00,849 --> 08:55:05,485
my quarters are cool I wish I could do it
it's hard work do him like hard work

3003
08:55:08,075 --> 08:55:12,820
do you watch Mikey on which he does at New
York

3004
08:55:13,702 --> 08:55:16,082
is a streamer and i r l

3005
08:55:19,778 --> 08:55:29,214
it's not because there's an overlap in the
subnets again is it because we have a 10.
Going on and have it turned on 96th and
maybe I got to subnet

3006
08:55:30,639 --> 08:55:31,858
wrong

3007
08:55:37,961 --> 08:55:44,648
I think I kind of think I did get to
something wrong because it's / 24 should it
be / 16

3008
08:55:45,938 --> 08:55:51,358
I think it's supposed to be / 16 yeah

3009
08:55:52,128 --> 08:55:58,296
I think we do have it wrong I think I think
it's exactly the same problem we had before

3010
08:55:59,989 --> 08:56:05,975
I saw 16 not not in the one that

3011
08:56:08,066 --> 08:56:11,226
we have a / 24 somewhere I can't remember
where

3012
08:56:15,313 --> 08:56:18,858
are you talking about you're talking about
the

3013
08:56:20,578 --> 08:56:23,643
the server the service is right

3014
08:56:30,179 --> 08:56:31,422
yeah

3015
08:56:53,794 --> 08:56:57,551
I don't and that is rent was your own one
day over that for sure

3016
08:57:00,710 --> 08:57:03,990
02 and is 0

3017
08:57:07,786 --> 08:57:09,132
yeah

3018
08:57:14,973 --> 08:57:32,761
I got my number is wrong with our way to be
/ 1/8 is the one that uses all three outfits
right and I am dyslexic elimin8 it is 8 the
one that uses all 3 of debts the last three
octaves are the 24 that's why I'm using my
285 70 mess so

3019
08:57:35,146 --> 08:57:43,600
always the last okay I got it wrong in so 88
is when these is the first aid and that
would make sense because you know

3020
08:57:43,840 --> 08:57:50,448
all right so that okay

3021
08:57:51,141 --> 08:58:01,615
well then then I'm in the only other thing
that we can try besides complete restall is
to do the Q ATM using the the PID thing

3022
08:58:01,762 --> 08:58:10,336
I mean using the letter Y

3023
08:58:20,715 --> 08:58:28,453
how can you tell well then why why is it
trying to talk to

3024
08:58:30,333 --> 08:58:32,070
Nintendo network

3025
08:58:37,178 --> 08:58:46,519
the only thing I can say is at this point
the only difference between the two has been
that argument that's been the only thing

3026
08:58:47,940 --> 08:59:06,992
it could be the decision of fault but for
some reason it must trigger something that
doesn't mean differently I don't know what
that that's the only thing that's been
different other than the range other than
the range that we just take check the range

3027
08:59:07,440 --> 08:59:15,495
I knew it would be interesting to check it
back on the way okay that and we haven't
done a full clear out of everything right

3028
08:59:22,492 --> 08:59:33,177
oh

3029
09:00:11,099 --> 09:00:13,093
shit nothing there

3030
09:00:30,721 --> 09:00:32,700
because this is not right

3031
09:00:45,104 --> 09:00:53,856
there's still a number of variables here so
one of them is that we haven't totally reset
that thanks

3032
09:01:16,503 --> 09:01:17,923
that's weird

3033
09:01:30,176 --> 09:01:32,129
what you think it changed

3034
09:01:34,730 --> 09:01:39,532
interesting yeah I mean if there's many many
possibilities I would not know any of them

3035
09:01:40,647 --> 09:01:45,188
I mean I do remember this destruction
staying pretty had waited to write those in
there

3036
09:01:46,170 --> 09:01:49,171
it kept saying is you're seeing I need it

3037
09:01:51,186 --> 09:01:55,016
let's try can we try this couch right or
reset

3038
09:01:55,525 --> 09:02:01,485
again I'm going to reset going to clear out
to see the Chucky

3039
09:02:01,716 --> 09:02:05,680
and then we're going to

3040
09:02:05,998 --> 09:02:11,876
we'll try the comedian with the with the
possible range

3041
09:02:12,032 --> 09:02:21,777
and if that doesn't do it then it's it's
it's back to resetting the whole thing go
back and let me know what works and making
more incremental changes

3042
09:02:22,796 --> 09:02:25,569
everything from scratch my same time yeah

3043
09:02:30,239 --> 09:02:36,537
yeah let's do that and this case that that's
that's fine right cuz we might be missing
something

3044
09:02:38,004 --> 09:02:44,761
yeah I like but I don't know if I went in
this case I think it was a bit I mean if it
works then

3045
09:02:44,762 --> 09:02:47,728
we can still help isolate the problems right

3046
09:02:47,798 --> 09:02:58,019
it doesn't work that well that's actually
really important right so if it doesn't work
then we absolutely know that is either
changing this this number to get somehow
conflicting or

3047
09:02:56,791 --> 09:03:11,486
or we need this in whatever version right
now this is the only two options because we
got it to work that way those are the only
two things have changed and I mean I feel
like we have to kind of go back and isolate
with changed so

3048
09:03:13,224 --> 09:03:19,980
so yeah same thing long time but I don't
care

3049
09:03:20,878 --> 09:03:24,900
I want to I want to an absolute clean redo

3050
09:03:38,486 --> 09:03:45,728
is that one time at work we actually deleted
that vagrant file as well even if it's like
really really clean slate

3051
09:03:46,367 --> 09:03:54,711
and I want to buy it could be the timing and
could be the timing of one thing coming
through before something else does I had
that problem with makeup before

3052
09:03:54,880 --> 09:04:00,455
in a provisioning is like one thing would
not be finished in since it was not
synchronous in this route

3053
09:04:00,521 --> 09:04:06,375
it was now no way to know what thing was it
was going to finish first

3054
09:04:08,709 --> 09:04:13,493
I I know that's what I'm saying the real
Otis has the recreate Which Wich

3055
09:04:14,771 --> 09:04:24,320
unlike you I'm still really interested in
figuring out how to do this with and anyway
because

3056
09:04:24,497 --> 09:04:28,500
you always have that option and pulling the
plug on the machine

3057
09:04:29,262 --> 09:04:34,110
you know you have the fucking chase that
shit down I would be a pain in the ass

3058
09:04:34,793 --> 09:04:43,945
Professor summer with so little experience
like me I mean right now anyway I mean I
could do it I'm good at finding problems
usually but but this

3059
09:04:46,717 --> 09:04:48,979
I kind of want to know what it is

3060
09:04:49,070 --> 09:04:55,287
I had the feeling the moral of the story is
just always put pod server IPs and you are
on everything

3061
09:04:55,581 --> 09:04:59,824
men nll make your day go better

3062
09:05:00,201 --> 09:05:11,950
I don't want that to be true but I just feel
like that's what it is because that's what
they keep screaming about it and then
stalled Ox I really hope we don't have to do
a Calico configuration specifically

3063
09:05:12,624 --> 09:05:16,730
wait we left that old cow configuration in
there too

3064
09:05:19,081 --> 09:05:29,727
oh no we didn't know it was snowing at
nevermind no I didn't know it was in that
was in the resource we had to do directly
and communities in the coronavirus at
someone away

3065
09:05:30,723 --> 09:05:36,416
we did not do that the second time though
maybe that was what was missing

3066
09:05:36,475 --> 09:05:43,713
remember that when we added the environment
variables Calico we didn't do that the
second time

3067
09:05:47,004 --> 09:05:52,386
remember when we did it like we did live
update on the on the couch with the
Federation

3068
09:05:52,386 --> 09:06:00,220
the name is a configuration we added that
and then to try right before this one yeah

3069
09:06:01,966 --> 09:06:06,963
could be how do you say

3070
09:06:09,519 --> 09:06:16,002
what time is it me and my nine hour streams

3071
09:06:18,475 --> 09:06:21,683
not a single fish in sight

3072
09:06:24,325 --> 09:06:31,972
we're going to get through this town is
going to be like really fast though I want
to get that down so I can do it in like
really quick quickly

3073
09:06:37,433 --> 09:06:47,491
so many moving pieces in this whole thing
though I mean this is this is why I like
traditional admits they see this shit and
they run there was one run screaming and I
fuck that I want nothing to do with it

3074
09:06:49,301 --> 09:06:55,122
usually he's at and does business partner
work interesting

3075
09:06:56,529 --> 09:07:02,516
you know you could have been just a minute
reset

3076
09:07:02,520 --> 09:07:07,287
we'll know soon enough because if that

3077
09:07:07,287 --> 09:07:16,920
I mean the one thing is we write about this
is we don't have to do all these steps Again
by hand and I always have to tell myself
that in the old days

3078
09:07:16,920 --> 09:07:30,895
resetting a system like this it's also makes
me like shutter at the idea of even that
booting again because you have to change
your images Annette Boudreaux and you could
never change the static image that would be
so bad

3079
09:07:30,896 --> 09:07:36,133
so you want to have an ansible thing that
runs after you refuse to do an option

3080
09:07:39,391 --> 09:07:46,003
a lot of this stuff is really sold me on
virtualization all over again even if you
take a performance penalty

3081
09:07:46,632 --> 09:07:53,094
hey I just cannot imagine the amount of time
lost doing all of this if we didn't have her
Tools location

3082
09:07:53,893 --> 09:08:01,032
it would be weeks our days at least

3083
09:08:09,138 --> 09:08:16,485
machine booted and ready vagrant shell

3084
09:08:25,636 --> 09:08:30,227
what are people doing today on Twitch I
doing something fun

3085
09:09:01,058 --> 09:09:06,210
who she talking about Jewel Jewel in Julian

3086
09:09:21,536 --> 09:09:24,651
I don't know if I want to go look at that
it's terrifying

3087
09:09:49,725 --> 09:09:56,495
yeah oh no a president is saying bad things
in what Universe do you think we live in

3088
09:10:00,853 --> 09:10:03,299
I mean I was hoping you would be better but

3089
09:10:07,711 --> 09:10:12,429
you're more than good old days and
presidents didn't say shit that was horrible

3090
09:10:12,996 --> 09:10:19,161
I just did shit that was horrible and close
doors and close to parts

3091
09:10:20,839 --> 09:10:23,264
once upon a time remember that

3092
09:10:30,211 --> 09:10:36,933
yeah all right so where do I go

3093
09:10:37,394 --> 09:10:41,633
with installation I could be true

3094
09:10:48,128 --> 09:10:54,323
comedian and it let me do it without it

3095
09:10:56,513 --> 09:11:04,337
API server advertise address

3096
09:11:04,564 --> 09:11:07,553
and I see what I see right at 2

3097
09:11:12,493 --> 09:11:14,033
right

3098
09:11:38,704 --> 09:11:40,125
Sia

3099
09:12:10,973 --> 09:12:17,927
do do do do do do do do do to do to do do do
do

3100
09:12:17,000 --> 09:12:19,188
do do do do

3101
09:12:30,707 --> 09:12:36,531
I feel happy I got time for an hour

3102
09:12:37,998 --> 09:12:40,688
how goes it

3103
09:12:44,446 --> 09:12:48,529
we shall now ask connect to Note 1

3104
09:12:50,367 --> 09:12:54,748
Minister work last time so I don't have any
doubt this can work this time

3105
09:12:55,006 --> 09:12:58,525
it was just it's the Calico stuff is not
working

3106
09:13:04,434 --> 09:13:10,486
have to be root of course god dammit

3107
09:13:14,895 --> 09:13:19,525
to do do do do do

3108
09:13:19,748 --> 09:13:27,115
tutu tutu tutu tutu dance on the Christmas
Merry Christmas I wanted it to be longer

3109
09:13:27,992 --> 09:13:32,769
I really did longer Christmas sex time

3110
09:13:34,559 --> 09:13:37,979
longer Christmas song or Christmas

3111
09:13:42,345 --> 09:13:45,973
a boy well that went well

3112
09:14:05,601 --> 09:14:08,905
not ready as we would expect

3113
09:14:10,238 --> 09:14:14,839
and pending as we also would expect

3114
09:14:18,604 --> 09:14:23,957
and now for the Moment of Truth we shall do

3115
09:14:25,230 --> 09:14:30,719
the apply with nothing more

3116
09:14:31,758 --> 09:14:35,112
nothing more than this humble apply

3117
09:14:35,496 --> 09:14:41,491
to get our wonderful Calico which I'm sure
is going to work without a problem

3118
09:14:42,038 --> 09:14:43,786
I have faith

3119
09:14:48,879 --> 09:14:53,956
see if I can just tell it's already working
can you just see it it's in an estate

3120
09:14:54,591 --> 09:14:59,704
it's all Happy Paws initialized here we go

3121
09:15:01,105 --> 09:15:07,268
containers are creating up this or that
stuff last time one of them came up

3122
09:15:10,505 --> 09:15:15,542
but not the one there

3123
09:15:16,468 --> 09:15:23,824
no dice no dice that is so lame

3124
09:15:27,713 --> 09:15:29,523
that is so lame

3125
09:15:31,334 --> 09:15:36,747
slimme1 came up pretty quick pretty quick

3126
09:15:39,171 --> 09:15:41,294
it's okay

3127
09:15:41,552 --> 09:15:50,325
from scratch it means Wiki ready accident
strictly speaking it's not from scratch
right because it's because we've used him

3128
09:15:55,083 --> 09:15:58,674
yeah let's do this let's go look at the long
again

3129
09:15:59,447 --> 09:16:07,494
I'm getting better at this it's a good
practice so I do not have a mon this time at
all

3130
09:16:07,542 --> 09:16:13,665
calico containers Calico

3131
09:16:16,011 --> 09:16:21,837
yeah I mean it's exactly the same I wish it
was in here I'll wait

3132
09:16:23,340 --> 09:16:25,745
potatoes Calico

3133
09:16:35,041 --> 09:16:42,790
2 222

3134
09:16:56,372 --> 09:17:00,613
what the ellipse

3135
09:17:14,887 --> 09:17:17,261
are you come out

3136
09:17:17,802 --> 09:17:23,128
and then we kiss you when I reset this this
one

3137
09:17:25,996 --> 09:17:31,207
I need to know if you can do this so much
ride anyway yes

3138
09:17:33,985 --> 09:17:37,175
and I'm going to cube ATM reset this one

3139
09:17:41,409 --> 09:17:47,743
yes and then I'm going to use this version

3140
09:17:58,351 --> 09:17:59,662
so happens

3141
09:18:06,208 --> 09:18:13,326
yeah we didn't delete it I'm trying it
without it first and then after that we'll
read it until I get the stuff in the stuff
in

3142
09:18:13,655 --> 09:18:18,920
Addison ice last night buddy if it doesn't
work out then next

3143
09:18:19,501 --> 09:18:22,583
didn't we do this

3144
09:18:25,888 --> 09:18:29,635
if it doesn't work I have you really fucking
baffled

3145
09:18:33,264 --> 09:18:40,037
the only thing difference between this and
the last one is the IP range that's it

3146
09:18:40,349 --> 09:18:43,248
and then I did we just get lucky

3147
09:18:50,928 --> 09:18:58,283
so yeah we definitely do

3148
09:19:05,858 --> 09:19:22,818
CareCredit okay and we know that these are
fucked up because you didn't clean out we
didn't clean out and see a nice last night.
But but

3149
09:19:23,218 --> 09:19:38,496
are less on track and then we'll do it that
way we'll do it the official we've gotten
this over before with that being kind of
hosted just because Brianna said that they
had the same problem so be able to know
about that promise super important

3150
09:19:40,848 --> 09:19:43,423
give me some be so great if it worked

3151
09:19:44,624 --> 09:19:52,137
running house fast shit that was fast
probably cuz it already has it download it
oh my God

3152
09:19:55,088 --> 09:20:00,067
oh my God oh my God

3153
09:20:01,414 --> 09:20:03,378
Leo

3154
09:20:04,796 --> 09:20:18,978
so the moral of the story is Val shalt
include pots service here you are in 1.2 3
and to be fair to LPG videos not using the
same versions kubernetes as I am

3155
09:20:18,979 --> 09:20:25,607
so and you know this is consistent with what
the documentation told us to do to

3156
09:20:25,607 --> 09:20:36,294
so the takeaway of this little going to
settle is now shall always put the pier it
is it is weird

3157
09:20:37,395 --> 09:20:40,195
eppinette if I fix it so

3158
09:20:43,487 --> 09:20:50,154
yeah I'm glad it's working I don't know so
well

3159
09:20:51,118 --> 09:21:01,364
and how how much different is this then is
the slash 17 that we had before right you
think I'm an official have the numbers in
them to see how you are in a Mil yeah let's
go check

3160
09:21:01,367 --> 09:21:06,968
let's go check that for sure so antsy

3161
09:21:07,567 --> 09:21:14,090
Freddy's grab that shower cidr

3162
09:21:14,090 --> 09:21:16,985
there you go holyshit

3163
09:21:17,813 --> 09:21:26,159
that is weird I'll be seeing you see that
you what that means that means that
something changed

3164
09:21:26,841 --> 09:21:34,420
that it's it wasn't writing that before so
even though it was the fault it wasn't
writing it

3165
09:21:38,367 --> 09:21:44,549
did you order your slicker nice like Alexa

3166
09:21:45,789 --> 09:21:50,521
so them

3167
09:21:52,388 --> 09:21:56,036
the really cool thing about this is is it
hey or appendix how you doing

3168
09:21:56,420 --> 09:22:01,312
is we actually know specifically

3169
09:22:03,254 --> 09:22:07,355
that you have it I'm going to put that in
his this is like so important

3170
09:22:10,180 --> 09:22:18,814
I'm going to let it out cuz I don't feel
like riding a big long you know Treatise on
it right now I think we already did
something related to this

3171
09:22:19,754 --> 09:22:26,201
and I give you probably doing wrong or
commiseration Resource Commission keeping it
came and yeah yeah

3172
09:22:30,229 --> 09:22:36,979
it could be a 123 bug I used to text cuz I'm
lame yeah

3173
09:22:54,144 --> 09:22:59,147
answer seidr

3174
09:23:03,145 --> 09:23:10,216
tell me five it's going to really want to
know about that yeah that's fucking weird

3175
09:23:12,136 --> 09:23:18,549
that's fucking weird is that the actual
default

3176
09:23:21,373 --> 09:23:27,456
yeah this isn't this is away 16

3177
09:23:29,112 --> 09:23:35,223
going stuff from the galang I think I think
from the golang project

3178
09:23:36,131 --> 09:23:42,060
I had three it can be resold on Amazon now
you can bet you about off Amazon

3179
09:23:42,695 --> 09:23:46,284
yeah yeah that's right I think that's what
about it

3180
09:23:46,521 --> 09:23:52,727
I can't remember honestly I don't remember
my trash in there somewhere

3181
09:23:57,533 --> 09:24:03,282
yeah I know so so there we go

3182
09:24:45,123 --> 09:24:53,724
yeah it was a horse Worcester but we
definitely got it we definitely got it so I
I don't know why this point

3183
09:24:53,724 --> 09:24:56,864
I want to take you cause it I think

3184
09:24:56,864 --> 09:25:04,489
no I no way I would never have known if it
if you have it is over I would never have
known to do that

3185
09:25:04,562 --> 09:25:07,588
at one another do any of this stuff so

3186
09:25:22,490 --> 09:25:29,734
even though the duchess parts or czr us
seems

3187
09:25:34,857 --> 09:25:38,049
I have a feeling it's a bug in Calico

3188
09:26:27,803 --> 09:26:34,228
I do, go back to the log and see how it
connected don't you like how did it connect

3189
09:26:36,277 --> 09:26:43,991
when do note to write with this dude on one
and I kind of want to see how it did connect

3190
09:26:47,855 --> 09:27:02,026
yeah we didn't do that extra configuration
thing either maybe they updated Calico from
4 to 3 I don't know if I'm glad right I
would rather add a city yard then didn't
have to add yet another additional
configuration for Calico

3191
09:27:10,404 --> 09:27:16,242
is in the docks seeing your art doesn't have
a default really

3192
09:27:16,718 --> 09:27:20,281
isn't going to get that right there is no
default

3193
09:27:21,003 --> 09:27:25,479
well you have a doctor that refers to that
it's not just on the main page

3194
09:27:28,367 --> 09:27:31,618
is there a resource for that

3195
09:27:32,004 --> 09:27:38,746
that's true I really want to knock that
resource and get that right so

3196
09:27:38,918 --> 09:27:43,831
God dammit is it really

3197
09:27:52,097 --> 09:27:57,971
wow count to go read it

3198
09:27:58,428 --> 09:28:05,410
right now so I can understand cuz I have to
answer any questions on the test about this
so stuff like that

3199
09:28:11,291 --> 09:28:15,586
execute the following phases we know about
this

3200
09:28:16,429 --> 09:28:25,083
options API is a bad idea

3201
09:28:57,290 --> 09:28:59,324
and you guys are

3202
09:29:41,309 --> 09:29:45,677
what is going to be the address

3203
09:29:46,071 --> 09:29:53,692
and you and you have added a second

3204
09:29:53,776 --> 09:30:00,227
h.h. on interface for the

3205
09:30:00,228 --> 09:30:10,701
private Network to get stuff to talk to each
other I kind of feel like we need to do

3206
09:30:14,105 --> 09:30:24,997
free to play around with what what if we got
the default network interface to do the
right thing like if we if we were to use
vagrant and to set it up as a as Bridget
instead of Matt

3207
09:30:24,998 --> 09:30:31,063
it would put it it would put it on the same
network as the rest of our stuff on her own
internal IP network

3208
09:30:31,064 --> 09:30:37,808
but I feel like that's also dangerous
because now it's going to be by chatting
with other stuff on my internal Network here

3209
09:30:37,809 --> 09:30:45,258
you can't interesting okay imma try that

3210
09:30:45,258 --> 09:30:51,501
oh shit they don't need to be not

3211
09:30:52,752 --> 09:30:58,997
a vagrant needs to be. I could have swore I
saw I could have swore I saw switch for that

3212
09:31:01,655 --> 09:31:09,186
Napier server addresses in the IP addresses
that the who advertises listen

3213
09:31:22,255 --> 09:31:29,674
this will be external and listening on six

3214
09:31:30,808 --> 09:31:34,530
sex 443

3215
09:31:36,030 --> 09:31:50,506
if I'm never going to face what we use but
this is a huge from my work my finger
anywhere and you have added a second
interface with the phone I just to talk to
each other without adding this your

3216
09:31:53,132 --> 09:32:02,579
set up will default to an interface that
isn't connected to anything

3217
09:32:11,558 --> 09:32:17,305
it's ready or what get rid of ignorant. Are
the natting

3218
09:32:18,678 --> 09:32:20,024
yeah

3219
09:32:24,801 --> 09:32:31,180
I mean I understand why they're doing it you
know it's safer to do its way safer to do
that

3220
09:32:32,076 --> 09:32:37,479
I would probably do the opposite that didn't
really kill myself cuz I'm definitely not
good to

3221
09:32:38,038 --> 09:32:40,678
draw that shit on the Food Network

3222
09:32:41,476 --> 09:32:46,250
this actually relates to what I'm going to
teach you the Boost because

3223
09:32:48,636 --> 09:32:55,665
and the booths were definitely going to get
you know

3224
09:32:56,116 --> 09:33:02,075
we're having a talk about work some machines
are going to say while should you brush your
not right and

3225
09:33:02,590 --> 09:33:06,577
unless you have a really really good reason
you should probably use now

3226
09:33:07,301 --> 09:33:15,705
and even want to know the difference is a
well one of them is like the computers
inside your computer the other ones like the
computer is next to your computer even
though it's all inside a computer tech
nothing

3227
09:33:15,992 --> 09:33:18,526
so

3228
09:33:21,673 --> 09:33:38,660
even if I'd say I cannot pass over share
your seems like people like people will
spend like 5 hours trying to trying to be
the hockey box game you know hacking it I
consider this hacking this gives me every
bit of satisfaction as playing at the box
for 9 hours straight

3229
09:33:38,662 --> 09:33:44,791
it's the same exact thing it's the same how
can I hack this to do what it's supposed to
do

3230
09:33:45,963 --> 09:33:52,848
are going a bit better it doesn't you know
these workarounds interesting because it
doesn't have them right

3231
09:33:52,919 --> 09:34:01,298
yeah I I I know I you know I delivered we
did it live you did live

3232
09:34:03,675 --> 09:34:06,588
that might have been a reason who knows

3233
09:35:25,050 --> 09:35:27,457
Orson how are you

3234
09:35:33,556 --> 09:35:37,637
yeah bigger bigger is Fox up in her face is
really bad and we found out

3235
09:35:36,607 --> 09:35:42,351
we found out out yeah bigger and doesn't say
a word instead of Mac address at all

3236
09:35:42,576 --> 09:35:49,747
and then I know it was using the same IP
address for every interface

3237
09:35:49,998 --> 09:35:56,080
every every machine because since were
nodding and then

3238
09:35:59,293 --> 09:36:06,734
no beyond that I don't know all I know is
adding Pawn server cidr fix it

3239
09:36:06,883 --> 09:36:09,258
how many things but that fix it

3240
09:36:11,042 --> 09:36:21,258
it still does rotational it something it's
something that you can see her being his
fault that's why I keep getting I would
really like to know what the modify eth0 to
do the right thing and it made me think of
it as the only interface

3241
09:36:21,976 --> 09:36:24,715
I feel like I feel like we're

3242
09:36:25,388 --> 09:36:34,689
I feel like we're kind of out of bounds a
little bit by using an additional interface
instead of using the default eth0 interface
but but vagrant needs it

3243
09:36:35,960 --> 09:36:46,629
yeah you need to redo 20 cm face that's
what's up because any of the standard
instructions for installation

3244
09:36:47,061 --> 09:36:50,710
are any of the standard installation
instructions

3245
09:36:50,710 --> 09:36:57,757
you know depend on using the default
interface and when you put it back on and
they're really fixing them

3246
09:36:59,642 --> 09:37:05,623
all right it's not a Calico bug usual

3247
09:37:07,639 --> 09:37:12,514
problem with that when

3248
09:37:18,723 --> 09:37:21,274
it seems the problem

3249
09:37:21,546 --> 09:37:30,079
is related to vagrants requirements for eth0

3250
09:37:31,046 --> 09:37:33,281
as the

3251
09:37:34,404 --> 09:37:42,006
management interface for itself therefore

3252
09:37:42,586 --> 09:37:49,644
requiring the creation of e t h 2

3253
09:37:50,912 --> 09:37:57,167
with a private Network

3254
09:37:57,363 --> 09:38:01,174
regrets other active

3255
09:38:01,755 --> 09:38:08,608
this change to the default Air Forces

3256
09:38:09,084 --> 09:38:16,840
certain things to be explicitly defined

3257
09:38:17,386 --> 09:38:22,815
or it's like you see seals qtm

3258
09:38:24,522 --> 09:38:30,756
or and seems to get confused

3259
09:38:30,792 --> 09:38:33,358
xnxubd

3260
09:38:43,798 --> 09:38:45,663
yeah

3261
09:38:51,004 --> 09:38:57,065
yeah well thank you for validating our
solution that we just spent an hour coming
to

3262
09:38:58,671 --> 09:39:20,794
I couldn't hear that you had that problem
you had the same fix it is a really good to
hear it I mean it I mean it I mean it I'm
not you know I'm not that there's no sarcasm
at all because we we we we we weren't even
sure that of this results until it happened
and they were like well it doesn't make any
sense because the error messages are saying
that it can't get the 10. 96

3263
09:39:20,798 --> 09:39:26,929
and we like what the fuck it's like network
is not working at all in this thing and

3264
09:39:26,929 --> 09:39:33,757
and it didn't make any sense cuz he needed a
piece of use default file Network

3265
09:39:34,089 --> 09:40:02,811
and I don't think we have it I don't think
there is a default on that works out what
you're saying I really want to read that I
think it I think I want to take a moment to
understand which networks have defaults and
which ones don't and how many networks are
we talkin about here you know what I mean
and because we're actually talking about a
third network away or an extra now we're
going to turn my big horn Big Red's you know
the master control Network on the 10.
Network that's not it so we have yet another
Network to deal with

3266
09:40:03,951 --> 09:40:09,086
so you know I'm saying on Summer

3267
09:40:09,373 --> 09:40:12,788
oh right now work thank you

3268
09:40:17,326 --> 09:40:18,804
MaryI married a s

3269
09:40:33,528 --> 09:40:35,205
oh yeah I do it again

3270
09:40:44,795 --> 09:40:52,034
yeah I don't want that locked in my brain
yeah

3271
09:41:10,275 --> 09:41:11,849
alright so

3272
09:41:13,240 --> 09:41:25,040
an unusual problem Calico can raise the play
the look of a reverse camera situation with
Kevin and wrinkly it seems the problem is
way too vigorous requirement for the 80s
your office management or face

3273
09:41:29,047 --> 09:41:34,554
Brian creation an additional

3274
09:41:38,084 --> 09:41:41,041
ath1

3275
09:41:44,470 --> 09:41:50,331
with the private records record this change
the default forces certain things to be
explicit

3276
09:41:53,999 --> 09:41:56,951
explicit arguments

3277
09:42:02,750 --> 09:42:07,125
certain optional arguments

3278
09:42:09,314 --> 09:42:11,949
CV required I guess

3279
09:42:13,644 --> 09:42:21,325
down the fall route interface which makes
regular kind of whack yeah that's a great
way of putting it

3280
09:42:24,239 --> 09:42:31,972
to put it in the words of Porsche nest

3281
09:42:36,427 --> 09:42:41,316
Calico on stew be in the default

3282
09:42:42,762 --> 09:42:45,085
route interface

3283
09:42:45,490 --> 09:42:51,252
which makes vagrants kind of black

3284
09:42:53,719 --> 09:42:56,039
also thanks to

3285
09:42:59,906 --> 09:43:06,276
a g g i n for and then hours

3286
09:43:06,306 --> 09:43:08,879
how can you debug ETSU

3287
09:43:18,389 --> 09:43:21,392
it did that was so weird

3288
09:43:26,478 --> 09:43:29,766
configure it yeah

3289
09:43:33,449 --> 09:43:35,470
give me a minute

3290
09:43:41,320 --> 09:43:48,736
exact address of the official Robert says
it's listening on its default will be
external on the Samsung 43

3291
09:43:51,197 --> 09:43:58,501
and test with tell tell Nance

3292
09:44:04,588 --> 09:44:21,309
and I said that I liked it because it's on
there installing the phone network in recent
years but this is a huge problem working
with fragrant you just might be tonight and
have added a second case one of the private
networks get stuck each other for CV father

3293
09:44:31,637 --> 09:44:33,042
yeah

3294
09:44:33,714 --> 09:44:41,599
I could not believe that donut was was on
redhead by default then that was weird

3295
09:44:42,061 --> 09:44:43,789
I know

3296
09:44:59,855 --> 09:45:03,366
it's a VIP mod why I don't know

3297
09:45:13,711 --> 09:45:17,433
I said I want it open this for second want
to read something here

3298
09:45:46,625 --> 09:45:47,749
in

3299
09:45:56,789 --> 09:46:02,174
again we go so the default network interface
will be used if not

3300
09:46:03,216 --> 09:46:10,118
the default is 6430 answer the phone as well

3301
09:46:12,311 --> 09:46:16,949
EXO cert directory as a default

3302
09:46:22,641 --> 09:46:24,105
3 string

3303
09:46:29,738 --> 09:46:37,103
I hear you. So the service is a default
figuring Catching Fire Guard

3304
09:46:38,962 --> 09:46:40,279
so

3305
09:46:58,477 --> 09:47:04,091
so i s role-playing will automatically I can
send yours everything

3306
09:47:04,468 --> 09:47:12,422
Social Services have a stat services or
default address Network 1096 that's good to
know

3307
09:47:13,486 --> 09:47:20,381
the appears that bigger has a default IP
network of 10.0.2

3308
09:47:20,754 --> 09:47:35,446
Venezuela to that seems to be the default
subnet for vagrant if you don't provide
anything else so far everything we've made
has been intended 02 if you have

3309
09:47:36,345 --> 09:47:43,383
there is apparently as you said no default
for the Pod cidr Network

3310
09:47:43,585 --> 09:47:45,980
the pond the pond

3311
09:47:47,130 --> 09:47:53,087
pod Network cidr

3312
09:47:56,859 --> 09:47:59,909
Cardenas did not work until I put it on
there

3313
09:48:03,149 --> 09:48:07,298
it would appear Cornelius is it a fault

3314
09:48:11,352 --> 09:48:16,359
I figured you'd be for not using convenient
to pick Prince yes

3315
09:48:19,204 --> 09:48:22,174
The Raconteurs images

3316
09:48:24,436 --> 09:48:27,461
every fear that was that's all

3317
09:48:30,078 --> 09:48:38,065
networking crd string Pat to the network
director that contains a files named

3318
09:48:39,409 --> 09:48:44,688
this is why I came to find range of IP
addresses for the Pod Network

3319
09:48:45,618 --> 09:48:50,944
it said the control plan will automatically
Alta terriers for every node

3320
09:48:54,658 --> 09:49:01,660
use alternative range for service Eyed Peas
okay so so this is not does not have enough
salt

3321
09:49:01,661 --> 09:49:32,782
which it was a really leaves me wondering
whenever I see I understand why you were
doing that environment change LBG now I
understand completely you were saying that
he was sick was picking it up off the
interface and it did the configuration
changes you were doing for the Calico cat
think we're related to changing the IP the
IP of the interface for Calico to pick up
and you were telling it to pick up the
interface still have to pick up the other
interfaces 1000 Network and by doing so then
it would like resolve its own. And part
number to a Dr stuff

3322
09:49:32,785 --> 09:49:40,427
I see why you were doing that now because
you are trying yeah you you are trying to
get it to

3323
09:49:41,081 --> 09:49:48,686
to infer the IP range based on what it
detected

3324
09:49:50,162 --> 09:50:04,497
for the interface was on because like like
my promotions think that because it went to
the default because it looked at the default
eth0 its other 10.0 tattoo and probably try
to just to do rounding on that

3325
09:50:05,242 --> 09:50:13,422
whatever reason we couldn't confirm rules in
the routes or anything and I got that wrong

3326
09:50:14,606 --> 09:50:15,950
so

3327
09:50:16,476 --> 09:50:26,259
is Alexa Calvin out of curiosity house
working absolutely all right so so that
that's working

3328
09:50:28,859 --> 09:50:32,079
and if I feel like this is this is good
enough for now

3329
09:50:44,229 --> 09:50:45,472
okay

3330
09:50:59,204 --> 09:51:02,694
I got it wrong well let me the first time

3331
09:51:02,877 --> 09:51:17,292
I mean I don't really need to know when
calicos doing other than how it works what
works in the day but I I am very curious to
see how to check the no doubt I thought we
did check it out already I only know two one
is working

3332
09:51:19,169 --> 09:51:25,252
as long as you can route those addresses
that's that's why we were so confused

3333
09:51:26,558 --> 09:51:34,052
I mean at least we were both confused since
I didn't read it that way and it's like

3334
09:51:34,804 --> 09:51:41,325
and when in doubt at it just to be sure it's
a safe was going to save you such a big
hassle if it doesn't work

3335
09:51:42,293 --> 09:51:44,751
kind of shit now working yeah

3336
09:51:46,218 --> 09:51:54,768
yep and they have pretty shit networking I
mean that's pretty sure I meet them open
bugs on the on the Mac problems

3337
09:51:54,954 --> 09:52:08,184
and if it if it turns to be much more
substantial than that I want to look for an
alternate that I don't know I don't I don't
I don't know what else is out there making a
whole bunch of Packer things and build your
own network

3338
09:52:08,522 --> 09:52:16,102
just making sure I calls the d-box manager
or something I don't know what they'll turn
it is you know

3339
09:52:16,945 --> 09:52:24,395
ansible terraform a telephone with the
telephone with it with a virtual watch
driver and then I'm open to that possibility

3340
09:52:25,491 --> 09:52:28,302
add peas and can I sell a Coon Rapids

3341
09:52:34,961 --> 09:52:36,765
so

3342
09:52:40,938 --> 09:52:43,822
Laura log containers

3343
09:52:58,022 --> 09:52:59,924
Plus

3344
09:53:09,452 --> 09:53:11,255
222

3345
09:53:15,897 --> 09:53:21,397
unless my talking about

3346
09:53:26,742 --> 09:53:31,549
Hungry Howie's there's nothing here

3347
09:53:35,900 --> 09:53:43,253
shit more Calico

3348
09:53:44,297 --> 09:53:51,909
no we want we want on what

3349
09:53:52,086 --> 09:53:59,123
I'm Brandon we need Cube system

3350
09:53:59,123 --> 09:54:04,853
node and then we need to Calico no log

3351
09:54:04,853 --> 09:54:11,015
what's her name

3352
09:54:14,333 --> 09:54:18,835
so I don't know if that I don't know if that
helped actually

3353
09:54:19,656 --> 09:54:27,236
start checking it every store connection
verified is for Freddy are getting resource

3354
09:54:29,486 --> 09:54:31,397
it's like Beautypedia

3355
09:54:32,039 --> 09:54:38,335
EZ Auto detected ipv4 address on Ethan
engineering 110. That was not there before

3356
09:54:39,491 --> 09:54:45,590
that I don't remember that line being that
way I remember they're seeing something else
there

3357
09:54:47,182 --> 09:54:53,940
I know that TV for change will check for
conflicts interesting

3358
09:54:56,087 --> 09:55:00,595
yeah it didn't get to this part it was like
I'm going to do a thing and then it failed

3359
09:55:00,874 --> 09:55:13,731
so and it's because this using Auto detected
address whatever Calico does to Auto detect
doesn't fly well with vagrants or at least
the way we were using Baker

3360
09:55:20,015 --> 09:55:25,021
okay so

3361
09:55:27,434 --> 09:55:33,573
no degree for changed check for conflicts

3362
09:55:37,332 --> 09:55:41,792
I didn't really do it did it no change

3363
09:55:44,170 --> 09:55:48,841
I guess I don't understand this line it's
like it change the IP

3364
09:55:54,216 --> 09:56:02,672
so this means the Pod was an IP before and
it changed it and it's like okay we're going
to do I automatically look for other
conflicts

3365
09:56:05,588 --> 09:56:12,385
but because of tools I had that rap DVD Mmm
Yeah Yeah I can see that usually being from

3366
09:56:12,888 --> 09:56:35,926
and I guess this is I'm just trying to hash
out you know beginner stuff it's been
extremely educational I mean God damn I've
learned so much and it's not the kind of
thing you can do unless you like try this
shit at home like you ATM if you don't even
have the beginning of understanding what
could possibly go wrong if you're just if
you just going off Theory and books and
doing some Vino

3367
09:56:35,928 --> 09:56:48,903
so I'm super happy for you even though it's
delayed my my storage stuff I'm going to
really kick ass tomorrow at work to make up
for the research I've been doing but I
consider this is extremely valuable research

3368
09:56:49,361 --> 09:56:51,182
so

3369
09:56:53,260 --> 09:57:01,557
at the front of no i p d i p I think that's
I would that's why I was confused because it
says it's changed it like there was nothing
before

3370
09:57:01,558 --> 09:57:18,289
so does that mean it was just picking up the
IP the default ethernet interface I imagine
that's what it was and that would explain
that would explain why I couldn't route
because it's that's that had lockdown Nat
management interface that varies

3371
09:57:18,291 --> 09:57:26,556
so it's been a good reminder of how
networking works and secondary interface is
excetera

3372
09:57:29,975 --> 09:57:35,714
so no no as number configured on no resource
Isabel value

3373
09:57:35,714 --> 09:57:39,261
give a damn configmap okay that's good

3374
09:57:39,925 --> 09:57:47,066
found this in the comedian could pick me up
this number right here came from

3375
09:57:47,066 --> 09:57:49,388
the cidr thing

3376
09:57:50,522 --> 09:57:56,928
that came from the Pod network cidr setting
that's exactly what it was set to

3377
09:57:56,929 --> 09:57:59,360
makes me wonder if

3378
09:57:59,360 --> 09:58:06,727
it got stuck on the step before but it
didn't print out these other statement these
other errors because I got so hung up over
there

3379
09:58:06,728 --> 09:58:13,495
I'll know it when is it going to be able to
be able to get it working at all wasn't
working so I could have even gotten a config
me up

3380
09:58:14,551 --> 09:58:21,955
f yeah

3381
09:58:23,176 --> 09:58:26,853
I think it was really weird about this is

3382
09:58:26,854 --> 09:58:33,145
after it happened it seems to have hosed up
other areas of networking on the system

3383
09:58:36,262 --> 09:58:41,738
we were okay so this is important

3384
09:58:41,851 --> 09:58:48,675
after we ran after we ran the Calico apply

3385
09:58:48,675 --> 09:58:53,470
we could no longer get logs and shit from
the infant

3386
09:58:54,114 --> 09:59:01,901
in fact we had to SSH into the nodeload and
read the logs outside of communities to get
to it

3387
09:59:03,109 --> 09:59:09,173
that suggests to me that the Calico apply
fucked up and networking of the cube proxies
well

3388
09:59:10,163 --> 09:59:12,958
and at least a return around

3389
09:59:15,687 --> 09:59:36,989
I mean because this before that I mean by
this is super important I want to make sure
I can remember this because before we apply
the Calico sea and I we were able to get
information and go back and forth and talk
to logs and everything we all the things you
can only do that or not populated we can do
it we can do just fine but then after Calico
came along

3390
09:59:37,560 --> 09:59:40,786
the basic you proxy not working wasn't
working anymore

3391
09:59:41,916 --> 09:59:47,846
I that I can't overstate how serious that is
if if that were to happen

3392
09:59:49,307 --> 09:59:50,600
yeah

3393
09:59:51,079 --> 09:59:57,314
if that were to happen in a production
environment that would be a streamly
critical outage

3394
10:00:00,912 --> 10:00:02,836
must be on the phone trap

3395
10:00:05,006 --> 10:00:10,978
so what happened is we install Calico Calico
said hey default route I'm a kick you out

3396
10:00:11,742 --> 10:00:40,804
and too pricey or whatever was using the
default route and yes it is said no I'm done
we're done here and Calico took it over
which is super bad and you're saying it's a
bigger bug because Victor has the fault this
is extremely unlikely to encounter in a
while because no computers very few
computers in the while they're going to have
different ethernet interface is for a
community's I mean most knows that one is
there a interface and that's it I mean they
might have more of those are not being used

3397
10:00:41,310 --> 10:00:46,116
that you teach one with off to these are you
have some saying yeah

3398
10:00:51,530 --> 10:00:55,080
LKQ proxy work before Calico setup properly

3399
10:00:56,063 --> 10:01:37,200
he told me I don't know what I'm trying to
say is I was like I don't even know what
your proxy I'm too new to know what I'm
telling you is it normal commands like
getting logs on them on the employee worked
I can do before I do the Calico fly I could
do keep CDL logs on the Pod and I could get
information even answer and after I did the
cow why didn't the cube shelf life for the
Calico H-E-B Source I could no longer get
Logs with the same exact amount and the only
way we can get logs is the SSH into the
known outside of communities

3400
10:01:39,514 --> 10:02:04,356
I'm just telling you the effect I'm telling
you the end-user affect I'm just saying it's
a big deal because if you if you can't
communicate with your nose because whatever
happened whatever reason doubt this dream is
just tanks my idea and then I know a lot of
us it has already my my exuberance about
about Metal base security token of thanks

3401
10:02:05,766 --> 10:02:10,658
you think I'd find differently make sure
they didn't find him

3402
10:02:12,750 --> 10:02:43,296
right I don't know what my plans are I'll go
back and read about plainedge and all that
so I'm just telling you the effect the
effect is it the command work before and
then afterward it stopped working and I'm
sure it's Network related and there's
different Communications we have a person we
went we went through that quite a bit we
went through will how How can any
communication happen whatsoever if there's
no see and I and obviously you can and it's
a different network and it says in its use
in Coop Roxy is probably got a different
name

3403
10:02:44,682 --> 10:02:47,892
are the bottom part of world is data plan

3404
10:02:47,892 --> 10:03:10,245
all right well that makes sense so the
control pain again to make your point out
the fact that installing Calico which is
supposed to be reduced in scope of severity
and risk to the date of plane having it fuck
up control plane Communications with the Pod
with an Ode to me that's a big fucking deal

3405
10:03:11,588 --> 10:03:20,474
I mean that's a big fucking deal for a free
Calico to like blow up the control plane
Communications

3406
10:03:20,475 --> 10:03:22,361
yeah I did

3407
10:03:22,365 --> 10:03:37,660
it did it stop the logs from working are you
saying that getting logs out the off the end
point is through community so you know that
you'll log command is it date of plane
operation is busy shoveling whatever

3408
10:03:37,860 --> 10:03:40,114
resources inresource doesn't exist pot yeah

3409
10:03:41,534 --> 10:04:02,023
or whatever I don't understand where you are
coming and so yeah everything is good at
work but looking up my video tell you we
were redoing standard things that are that
were fine and as at least intrigued with
regard to the logs command

3410
10:04:02,150 --> 10:04:23,803
write that specific command whatever
protocol use I don't care whatever for a
cayuse it did not work and it just see sore
and so we had to SSH into the reason I keep
harping on this is because I have been
really like froby caretti's on metal and
said Arrow antenna tell us about us up and
now I'm like fucking terrified of it

3411
10:04:23,907 --> 10:04:38,129
how the hell are you going to debug a
problem if you only have mtls access to the
thing and has to go over the API and then
and then you try to do a Calico installing
something like that until it goes her in her
brain nice

3412
10:04:38,481 --> 10:04:45,036
I don't even know if Sarah has its own sea
and I probably does I mean it doesn't make
any sense right

3413
10:04:45,573 --> 10:04:52,396
Jim you can't win Wednesday night at work
and you only have one tonight provider for a
cluster right

3414
10:04:52,526 --> 10:04:59,462
I get that right yeah

3415
10:05:06,427 --> 10:05:09,146
Heroes vs.

3416
10:05:10,288 --> 10:05:14,880
The logs function stopped working it's not
overly stressed

3417
10:05:15,045 --> 10:05:21,904
and I would be unable to rectify the
situation if I didn't have SSH access

3418
10:05:24,268 --> 10:05:34,721
it was Angelica would all have been whatever
that stopped me from communicating through
kubernetes with my endpoint for a specific
command that was the problem and that is a
big deal

3419
10:05:37,632 --> 10:05:42,708
Attalla says configure being for you see
when I mean that's that's that's that's that
I did right

3420
10:05:43,769 --> 10:05:50,481
okay so does that mean I don't know I
understand I don't understand enough

3421
10:05:53,619 --> 10:05:59,302
is Uranus see you then

3422
10:05:59,944 --> 10:06:02,880
just a totally is

3423
10:06:02,880 --> 10:06:09,206
let me know when you get your lungs as it
keeps each old man from the from the control
plane how is that not

3424
10:06:11,003 --> 10:06:55,735
but whatever it would take about one command
the fact that something that supposed to
work stopped working and the only way to get
it to work was to bypass all of Freddy's
that is not good that's not good and it sent
me it might have been a trivial thing I
might have been logged with the fact that
even existed raise his suspicions for me
anyway about other applications that might
promise the world and then have some quirky
thing that keeps pizza for you we we we
talked about this before I was saying if
it's somebody was saying that that they
don't trust the idea of of of non SSH access
to their nodes to the post so I should say
the most machines and and I I feel like

3425
10:06:55,740 --> 10:07:02,866
and I got today one and a zero install was
incorrect oh you weren't here for it so your
opinion doesn't matter

3426
10:07:02,945 --> 10:07:45,791
he chatted working we appreciate your
confirmation and what actually happened and
so we'll see we'll leave it at that is
completely unrelated to the problem we had
to because you don't know who you were here
I can't even kiss you to allow us to travel
to apps that are going through the essential
as well yeah I was thinking about the issue
that I have and you know having problem with
you or is that a an advertised things didn't
do what I was supposed to do and I don't
give a shit if it was vagrants fault the
fact is the reality is is that

3427
10:07:45,794 --> 10:08:18,081
one of the core commands for for diagnosing
your in points stopped working and all the
time not on the case but I can people I work
with a lot of times we say did they what
they would like doing like prematurely SSH
into the endpoints and start doing shit on
there as a cessation try to diagnose sings
Looking Through the catalogs and you know
and running a doctor or and or you know
whatever one is much I don't know what does

3428
10:08:16,666 --> 10:09:04,615
the the city i s e d i c t h and they're
doing it a lot and I was like oh yeah you
can do that and Cody has a chain and I think
that's a lot of like extra Administration
and security to have to keep lockdown you
know why can't we have this like black box
or the note and the machine combination and
that leaves me that makes me begging the
question what happens when is he and I is
provided by Sarah Oh and and you can't you
put Calico van everything else do you can
you have your own tonight so I take away
this is really just one thing I need to
understand the scope is he and I and how how
you can possibly have a difference in a
provider if at all

3429
10:09:05,314 --> 10:09:09,932
I have one simple question do you only have
one seeing a provider for cluster

3430
10:09:11,130 --> 10:09:19,032
is that is that true or not so

3431
10:09:19,984 --> 10:09:33,866
enemy X know and I appreciate your
experience yeah and everybody appreciates
mostly force it the number one thing I do
appreciate is that you confirm the findings
that we just had

3432
10:09:33,866 --> 10:10:01,479
so you've completely confirm that we were
there we were experiencing the problem that
you've also had so that is invaluable to me
I really appreciate that but yeah it's a
separate communication that communication
stops working you know this is what happened
I did it to see Jalen fly

3433
10:10:02,103 --> 10:10:06,820
on anyting anyting and the network stop
working on the known

3434
10:10:07,902 --> 10:10:10,153
Winter Garden communities

3435
10:10:11,223 --> 10:10:22,130
that that is what happened at you can blame
it on vagrants you can blame it on the
network configuration but the fact that you
can do that

3436
10:10:22,456 --> 10:10:32,868
that that is what concerns me is the fact
that you are even capable of fucking up
communication with your end point by simply
applying

3437
10:10:32,915 --> 10:10:37,926
you know in this case when I I think it's a
damn it said

3438
10:10:38,951 --> 10:10:45,881
and I think that's a big deal it never works

3439
10:10:47,631 --> 10:10:53,838
are you saying that logs would not have
worked at all cuz I'm pretty sure we did it

3440
10:10:54,450 --> 10:11:02,365
wherever those some of those instead of
psyllium Calico if I have another one that's
watching them to do

3441
10:11:03,155 --> 10:11:05,038
so

3442
10:11:16,858 --> 10:11:24,246
yes the lungs working that could help
financially did yeah

3443
10:11:24,810 --> 10:11:31,587
but that was the other thing too is that one
of the one of the nodes

3444
10:11:33,325 --> 10:11:42,156
when we applied the Calico thing one of them
worked one of the pods came online and that
was the one on the control plane that didn't
have to do any routing

3445
10:11:44,153 --> 10:11:50,867
datum plane because Calico is not
operational right okay

3446
10:11:51,429 --> 10:12:08,184
all right what is very possible it's very
possible that we did not try to log command
before Calico is installed on I could have
swore we did lvg to remember that's
something you were three creating I could
have swore we did

3447
10:12:08,185 --> 10:12:15,363
I just know that I can totally be great by
the way I know the exact steps to make a
break again just remove that argument

3448
10:12:15,428 --> 10:12:23,537
I want to think that we did the logs against
the then today to playing stuff and it
didn't work

3449
10:12:25,980 --> 10:12:33,563
that what you're saying it could very well
be and that would then we would all be in
agreement

3450
10:12:33,564 --> 10:12:44,485
this is a ride and yeah that was that was
that was not there I could have swore and
I'm questioning it now I could have swore we
did a logs query

3451
10:12:45,036 --> 10:12:49,530
I could have swore me to send the deposit
even exist

3452
10:12:50,395 --> 10:12:57,933
that was after we never tried it before
then. Did we I mean that's probably what it
is

3453
10:12:56,687 --> 10:13:03,176
that's probably what was his one day he'll
listen to you why don't you listen to me a
little bit huh

3454
10:13:05,497 --> 10:13:14,211
he really fond of telling other people to do
so you know yeah

3455
10:13:14,870 --> 10:13:40,373
yeah I think that's probably it now this is
nothing you told me is anything that she
knew the one flaw and everything that I said
here is being unsure about whether I ran the
logs against the pot that was remote but I
swear to God we did I swear to God we did
and that would that would break it to
confirm yeah I kind of want to I kind of
want to because

3456
10:13:41,233 --> 10:13:43,188
you know what that would be

3457
10:13:45,357 --> 10:14:09,382
I mean it makes an expiration date and plan
is appreciated I mean that we figured it was
something different there is anything
communication what you're saying is it logs
the logs communicating from pods have to use
the potty and I had was I don't have any
fucking at work at all and it and it and
that communication is a part of the datum
plane as opposed to standing in my in my
particular case

3458
10:14:09,646 --> 10:14:16,869
yeah well if it's possible and I would love
to be wrong and I guess we all definitely
test

3459
10:14:16,869 --> 10:14:24,203
what businesses are part of a bigger
question which I have and there's two big
questions one of them is how would I put
Sarah when points in here

3460
10:14:24,228 --> 10:14:36,677
number one if I'm managing my own cluster
right at managing my own cost and I want to
add something to tell us in points and
they're all in all things like Mama bus will
take care of all for you then obviously
they're providing their own see and I

3461
10:14:36,678 --> 10:14:54,404
if they're providing their own C&I what
about when I try to play I'm going to have
to create some tanks art alterations in or
did not deploy to Dad because it already
hasn't or is it going to answer any of you
and me to do the joint is going to show up
and it's going to try to do it is going to
say I'm sorry I don't need your fucking
seeing eye I got my own

3462
10:14:54,406 --> 10:15:11,461
in which case you know how are you managing
to seeing eye. Sit around and tell us their
needs or this new generation of of bare
metal and metal communities in points

3463
10:15:13,574 --> 10:15:23,182
and so the only way to talk to it at all is
through a m Tillis

3464
10:15:23,353 --> 10:15:29,779
grpc over mpls it has its own API and

3465
10:15:29,779 --> 10:15:31,861
you can mix and match

3466
10:15:31,861 --> 10:16:03,539
it it has its it has 100% has its own his
has its own API and you cannot SSH to the
thing and there there they're touting it is
and it's it's pretty pretty I don't know if
it's something is going to take off the
reason I'm interested in is I don't want to
have to run systems Administration test and
also Cooper days Administration underlying
hosts Network for all your nose you have two
large

3467
10:16:03,541 --> 10:16:11,983
collections of it architecture to support
you have all of the underlying systems whole
systems

3468
10:16:12,199 --> 10:16:27,673
and it's what I'm trying to say right now
you have all the underlying health systems
and then you have all of their kubernetes
systems on top of that and there's a number
of efforts including a cluster ctctel which
just went one Pinole in July

3469
10:16:27,674 --> 10:16:33,814
that are trying to to bridge this Gap

3470
10:16:33,814 --> 10:17:22,799
and I'm super intrigued by it I'm intrigued
by it but I'm also nervous and the people
have presented this to so far they're like
no way you're not taking away message access
to my house and like yeah but if you could
do it in a secure way so that there's
security was the number one concern to
Defcon about clusters and they're getting
hacked because people are breaking other
container engines and breaking out of
communities and they're gaining access to
the systems is happening all over the place
right now so as whether or not they're
always is is the answer I don't know but the
fact that they are attempting to address the
issue by saying even if you break out of
this you get read-only access to the file
system and nothing else that's the attempt
and whether they do it or not I don't know
they don't have you if you support and stuff
like that but I find it really fascinating

3471
10:17:22,803 --> 10:17:38,183
because if this works the future could be
the future could be coronavirus on metal and
which means that you're managing your entire
infrastructure to accommodate use instead of
having to basically two sets of
infrastructure that are intermesh you know
at the hip

3472
10:17:36,723 --> 10:18:37,242
you know at the hip you're you're you're
supporting your your Baseline host of us
whether or not you realize it or not some
for you and you're supporting all of your
camera Deez Nuts on top of that and so you
see you see it was torture people starting
to ask a question it would it be cool if we
could just manage all of the thing from one
interface and it might be fine in the sky
before definitely thinking about this I mean
is that cost $52 absolutely based on this is
it's based on this mean you know you only
have one thing to update right now like
right now the problem is is that we had this
time it's like people have to ask us to
cordon off note so that they can do system
upgrades I can upgrade the version of red
hat or something right so I have to take
down or kubernetes does and they got me can
you know you know shuffle all the the
container work off to something else and
then those things have to be cordoned off
and then naked they get their system
upgrades and we bring back up to software
I'm on there you know I'm saying and it
sometime

3473
10:18:37,385 --> 10:19:07,951
the opposite problem sometimes we need to
use an extra NVIDIA drivers me like that for
something any job than a machine-learning
job and so we have to tell a structure
people hey can you add this bit of of of
Hardware this bit of driver which doesn't
fall within the purview to create his people
so now they're putting drivers on his stuff
and we also have to take him down and we
have to coordinate that the coordination
between the infrastructure Engineering Group
and the communities Administration group is
is where the pain point is

3474
10:19:07,954 --> 10:19:13,543
what's that ya is Equestria man in the
customary system

3475
10:19:14,085 --> 10:20:09,057
yeah the guy is is pretty good it's got big
problems for just casually looking at it the
other day I went to bed I don't want to get
into it right now but but let's start with
the fact that you have to have a booty
bootstrap cluster yet they install Mini
Cooper for him use the thing doesn't work
unless you already have a cluster to do the
management see if they have an extra closer
you have to have a cluster and just to do
the management of the other Hardware cluster
because it's all the written for kubernetes
itself which is kind of cool it's like
eating your own dog for kind of thing but
it's multiple layers of complexity that that
I don't know I am not sold but yeah that's
it is what it is so you know this is a
really cool thing to do but you know what
another option would be thanks for that

3476
10:20:09,063 --> 10:20:11,891
I'm fine I would be any different either
right

3477
10:20:12,881 --> 10:20:55,420
so so yeah so I think that those are things
that that would eventually somebody
experiment and one likes it so much so they
talk to me and they got a premature to put
my name on there I'm not and I should have
put me on there I'm not in that I'm not an
expert on this shit all I happen to talk to
them like one day and then they threw me in
here and I'm like okay fine and then they
put me in here even though I wish they would
take me out but whatever it seems to me like
they're doing the right things though
they're doing what I want so I don't I don't
want

3478
10:20:55,424 --> 10:21:42,787
I don't want to fuck around with my
infrastructure and my crew bonetti's I want
both I want my peanut butter and my
chocolate together I'd I don't want to fuck
around it I I want to see you today and it
might be you know Pie in the Sky a dream and
I think you'll all agree on that mean if
your if your behind cluster cluster CTL then
you can probably there's a lot of there's a
lot of thoughts on the the idea of managing
Hardware through kubernetes and that's all I
just want to see where that goes there's a
couple of different takes on it as one you
know completely ephemeral read-only access
to know only through the API know what does
Ajax this is that one and was that I was
just find that measurement cluster is
necessary

3479
10:21:43,311 --> 10:22:18,178
and the only reason a management class it
would be necessary as if you would grab the
keishin as a couple days application. Which
I would have done I would have done that but
that's what they decided to do there's a
certain time when you can put Grey's aside
and you can say you know what we don't have
to make everything a kubernetes application
we can make it a standalone single
executable that's that's bloated and has
everything in the world in it and I would
rather they have a good day would have dress
that the reason that you have to do it is
because there's so many different types of
hardware and shit in apis everything you
have to talk to you and you can't put
everything into a

3480
10:22:16,754 --> 10:23:04,294
put everything into a single executable
because there's so many layers and seems and
all the same reasons that could bring it is
just a bunch of apis at the end of the day
that's what they end up doing yeah how do
you manage and clusters exactly an end that
well. You know that's what coronavirus is
designed to do is designed as you a lots of
going to manage lots of different things
through lots of abstraction a lots of ppis
and you know at some point yeah sure I feel
like I feel like people reached too quickly
for that though I think that they should
stop the bad think about it you know they
did it right I don't know that they would
have made that they necessarily had to make
a kubernetes application to manage a turban
in his application that's running on
communities on Hardware that's managed as
hosting communities

3481
10:23:05,116 --> 10:23:42,548
it's just a certain level of complexity
that's there is people think it's necessary
and call me naive for saying so I don't
think it's necessary every time and I hope
you will agree with me and I just told me
her and say there are people that agree that
this doesn't happen to know that one exists
and if that weren't true so anyway I just I
wish that they had known that was there when
we start of some Alternatives that's my
first procedure coasters you feel and I
think it's been thinking about it I also
think it's extremely fascinating what
they're doing over here with this little
black box kind of thing over his dinner as
well

3482
10:23:42,563 --> 10:24:20,929
was model happy to Cheryl I think it's
important I'm not really interested but if
you wanted to talk about it you know to me
it feels like a solution that's coming from
an over engineered background and it and I
don't like that I don't I don't like over
engineered Solutions I barely like you're
ready and there's a ton of shit about the
raise that I think it's just way over the
top of the necessary and and I think so
going to get you a black check mark today in
the world but you know it's I try to call it
like I see it. Is it going Aaron welcome

3483
10:24:22,155 --> 10:25:02,616
so yep mystical I mean forcing all we need
to do is we need to have we need to have you
I know if you'd be willing to talk on on
Discord we should have you and Tony 5 we can
get 20 for the talk go through that because
I think that what that's not immediately
relevant to anything that we're doing right
now to get a job or anything but in the next
five years this is going to be a big deal
because it's going to save companies tons of
money giving management was garbage yeah it
absolutely is it still is I know I
completely agree and if you're talking about
just general config management

3484
10:25:02,620 --> 10:25:16,709
nobody is as fix that nobody is fix it yeah
it's still it's still a problem and it's not
just that there's like other kick management
out that it sucks to I don't know I don't
know I don't I don't know that

3485
10:25:16,711 --> 10:25:23,576
Community Solutions I'll have to say I don't
know I don't know I haven't followed it that
that closely I

3486
10:25:23,577 --> 10:25:49,871
I don't know I think one of the solutions is
to remove options personally and to have
opinions and communities is like really
hates having opinions as soon as coronavirus
has an opinion is like oh fuck no see and I
also fuck knows you know let's doctor fucked
is so now we're going to do you know we're
going to have a delay or no traction cuz we
can't have an opinion here

3487
10:25:49,873 --> 10:25:53,004
is it Mexico's if you're interested to come
in

3488
10:25:53,004 --> 10:26:00,013
actually white pages are they going to
search the web page I know what you're
talking about when I click view page source

3489
10:26:00,257 --> 10:26:14,646
action code like if you were to enter this
command line absolutely from the web page
actually are who is the server but yes

3490
10:26:15,757 --> 10:26:25,607
was that I'm going to talk about Nick so
something out yeah that mean he'll do it
says this does remove options yeah it does I
mean

3491
10:26:25,609 --> 10:26:32,548
it's like a big the car to the emerald and
dynamic Yeah by different companies wanted
me to see and I yeah

3492
10:26:32,549 --> 10:26:57,910
cap has become the standard is very few do
not agree so you know I I would really love
some of you Heavy Hitters to talk about that
and just sit back and eating popcorn and
because I am just a newbie here right I am
just a newbie what video this video

3493
10:26:57,054 --> 10:27:03,535
video this video no nothing we talk about
here will ever be on YouTube unless it's on
Saturday

3494
10:27:04,321 --> 10:27:11,149
going to catch the ball over here in time
and come stop by you have 60 days to watch
the vod's if you want to come back and watch
him

3495
10:27:11,958 --> 10:27:46,829
this is not this is not an organized thing
by the way and it had all cash as well this
is not a sin than organizing I will
eventually summarize you know all the
mistakes I've made in a way that hopefully
will be helpful for beginners there's nobody
answering I know I think if I would agree
with you on that as well I think you would
agree for sure if those are all good things
I I don't want to spend too much energy on
the communities on metal of conversation but
I think that is the future personally

3496
10:27:47,553 --> 10:27:54,883
yeah ain't loyal calicos not making a dime
off of it mindshare yeah

3497
10:27:55,323 --> 10:28:39,293
I need to be really interesting I don't know
if I would probably have more information
and I don't I don't know at all I don't have
any any bead on the game that's going on in
the car. Space I know what I need to know to
do my job and then this is Neo that I try to
identify the leaders using landscape or
whatever but so I know what to learn a I
know what does I know it is Gabby can owes
canoes on middle Sodus are oh I think that I
think that that space is shaping up in an
interesting way and that's all I have to say
about that I would love to see metal burned
in kubernetes at some point

3498
10:28:39,297 --> 10:28:42,240
I mean what about from our communities

3499
10:28:43,762 --> 10:28:51,687
I know it's like you think it's crazy but
the k3s stuff people are starting to think
that way so

3500
10:28:51,723 --> 10:29:06,623
you know when you can get it anyway it's a
really fun exciting thing to think about it
has no relevance to your job today it's mine
but but the idea of being able to

3501
10:29:06,679 --> 10:29:25,315
be able to totally encapsulate away
everything you know about the hardware and
then and then just managed just the one the
one in point as opposed to to you have to
manage to in points if you don't use this
and that's why it kept me is For The
Straight Guy

3502
10:29:25,329 --> 10:29:35,825
so it's great I'm really glad that you have
been has been in that for so long has been
really fun to hear what you have to say
about that when I get into it

3503
10:29:35,826 --> 10:29:51,467
running has coronavirus which they acquire
to be there in less. For the company's
platform yes they did and included at the
time I remember Rancho s was a kind of
involved to let you in and a fork

3504
10:29:51,469 --> 10:30:18,370
so I guess we had so much fun it cheaper on
computer to the master and second chorus is
Dad after they got ahold of a programmer and
I was like holy shit and they said yes and I
wasn't going to let you know it's not as
well with the Linux kernel but all the stuff
around the edges is all is all is all go and
I was like why did they do that and Russ
orsi or something like that I don't know
they didn't go

3505
10:30:18,990 --> 10:30:24,917
yeah they got rid of everybody ain't got rid
of it yeah

3506
10:30:24,917 --> 10:30:42,905
a very much thanks Jennifer but that's why I
don't like right at there's a lot of reasons
I don't like her that but you can't deny
that red has to go to the go to distro for
Enterprise even if openshift isn't that
definitely is

3507
10:30:44,071 --> 10:31:13,120
so that's why I'm focusing on in the
beginning by the way there's any beginners
out there still listening we're going to
we're going to do the MRI with a p t 12 so
you can get used to the APT package manager
and then when we get to the in for surgery
stuff going to be doing we're going to be
doing would be red hat because that's my
hands down the Enterprise leader for that
stuff and then if somebody wants to go
forward and get right at certified whatever

3508
10:31:13,455 --> 10:31:37,989
I I think I I I I I I don't have a handle on
it I hope that's true but having gone
through the pain points of just trying to
set up Ubuntu servers vs. Enterprise servers
that I just did just in my short little
thing here and it was much easier to set up
the redhead stuff

3509
10:31:37,063 --> 10:31:40,708
and that's all I have to say

3510
10:31:41,975 --> 10:31:51,231
do I get from Red Hat yeah yeah I know
redhead look redhead is a really good at
making you think you have to have it

3511
10:31:51,601 --> 10:31:56,429
but aren't you want them or do you want you
do you want to just do that is famous for
making desktop Linux

3512
10:32:00,453 --> 10:32:08,025
what do you put on there Debian what were
you going to go what you going to do besides
redhead Susan

3513
10:32:08,481 --> 10:32:12,910
Susan is good then we're very aware supports
whatever you want

3514
10:32:15,917 --> 10:32:17,284
WhatsApp

3515
10:32:18,503 --> 10:32:24,160
I don't know I'm kind of interested in Alma
is going to control that shit forever

3516
10:32:26,299 --> 10:32:33,622
like yeah it's expensive for sure it is

3517
10:32:35,312 --> 10:32:42,533
sindicato absolutely 450 weihnachtsmann
Drake

3518
10:32:43,566 --> 10:32:56,039
I don't know we went with a pretty good
debate about that discussion the other day
about what the best but it was the best
Enterprise Linux distro and their strong
opinions on that all around

3519
10:32:58,139 --> 10:33:09,806
what I want to know is can you get it can
you put Elmo s can you put can you put Alma
8 in your Enterprise in production and not
and get away with not paying somebody for
rent at support

3520
10:33:11,356 --> 10:33:21,156
you have to let me know that you got that
enterprises love the support contract that's
what they love and the banks might not like
it but some of mine up don't like paying the
money but they pay Microsoft for crazy

3521
10:33:21,670 --> 10:33:29,242
or clinics you know what you'd be surprised
yeah

3522
10:33:29,279 --> 10:33:32,840
I know there's no there's no winner ass
always everybody's different

3523
10:33:33,215 --> 10:34:07,626
but I think the The Lion's Share of the
district Market if we can measure it this is
really we talked about this before just in
general on this channel about people's
warped ideas about distro is based on
YouTube and twitch and rented versus the
reality was actually deploy to the number of
this was it have been deployed if you can
watch the store too for an hour and year and
he'll never ever tell you a breakdown of the
distributions as as as as it could be
counted within the Enterprise because it had
the fucking numbers nobody does

3524
10:34:07,628 --> 10:34:33,612
and so it's it's downright irresponsible to
say oh arches the best sister for this in
this in this or or dipping is better because
of X and Y and meanwhile millions of systems
millions and millions of systems of rain the
most important software and applications in
our world are running on these dishes that
nobody sees because they're behind a
secretive Walled Garden and nobody has any
idea

3525
10:34:33,614 --> 10:34:59,368
and if you want to get anything close to an
idea you got to subscribe for $50,000 to
Gardner Medical Group who goes through and
interviews all these companies and pays a
high price dollar to get some indication of
what those companies are doing what's the
time they lie about it and they come out and
tell you they charge anyway it's a total
rocket as a total wreck if you want to know
the truth if you want to know the truth of
what distros are being picked by the most
people

3526
10:34:59,370 --> 10:35:07,038
at the sitio level in a huge Enterprise or a
multinational corporation you cannot find
that information you can't get it

3527
10:35:07,767 --> 10:35:10,397
he needs to Colonel Kira nerys

3528
10:35:10,397 --> 10:35:21,050
well I agree with that except for I can I
can say oh I don't know three different
outer just last month that happened because
people think that way

3529
10:35:21,140 --> 10:35:28,557
it's no you have to think about this is the
problem this why you think I want it I want
to see them merch

3530
10:35:28,558 --> 10:36:03,776
I want to see the merger because the outages
we've had every single outage has been
related to kubernetes combining in a bad way
with an operating system and Legacy iptables
shit that is fucked up our Network and is
nothing to do with me this is nothing to do
with me I'm just telling you the reality the
reality is that the underlying host OS
matters and a particularly if you've done
anything special with with networking or in
a monitoring and stuff like that

3531
10:36:03,886 --> 10:36:15,233
yeah I would like I would love for the
colonel Kira nerys to be the way to go the
problem is it's never going to happen that
way

3532
10:36:15,233 --> 10:36:18,175
and if I don't I wish you would I would do
that so that's why I think

3533
10:36:16,745 --> 10:37:02,339
that's what is why I think Cyril's is on the
right track this something important as soon
as as soon as we can buy Hardware that's
already been provision for kubernetes you
just flash the firmware whenever you get the
latest and you're worried about the security
and it's all it is is accurate is no to the
end and it's completely and totally locked
down and nobody talks to it except for the
vendors and you know and that's going to
Viola gplv3 and all kinds of shit I want
that if I was buying if I was buying a big
lots of big Iron I would want that because
it would be cheaper to maintain it would be
so much easier to configure and if there's a
problem you know you have one one point of
contact to deal with when if there's a
problem

3534
10:37:03,280 --> 10:37:23,278
so the problem is doing that is like it's
it's making tons and tons of Highly
opinionated decisions about what's going to
be on a thing right now one of our biggest
challenge is keeping up with the video
fucking drivers we are a huge fucking
machine learning cluster huge and our
biggest challenge one of the biggest
challenge is keeping up with NVIDIA drivers

3535
10:37:23,861 --> 10:37:31,521
now you can do that for kubernetes I'm sure
professional essay cluster and cluster API
you know

3536
10:37:31,815 --> 10:37:39,173
and it's a pain in the ass it's a pain in
the ass getting your driver here in

3537
10:37:41,180 --> 10:37:44,023
yeah mix have to be a speaker

3538
10:37:46,014 --> 10:37:52,361
but if you can shoot a few guys that would
be up I think that's where it's going but
that's not where Legacy Hardware is

3539
10:37:52,363 --> 10:37:57,708
and nobody has a BF a BF ebpf for anything
close to it deployed in production right now

3540
10:37:58,237 --> 10:38:17,019
bacon image I think that's what you should
do just make an image into it the problem is
you sous-vide bacon images and you have a
you know they do make an image by the way
they they have one in the oven Sybil like
tweak it after that now they have Chef trips
I forgot we're still in Chef our
infrastructure citizenship

3541
10:38:17,200 --> 10:38:22,182
which is another reason it's not so bad that
learning Ruby there's so many people still
using that shit

3542
10:38:23,384 --> 10:38:28,274
let me know what the value is Oh you mean
you're going to have it here it is

3543
10:38:29,606 --> 10:38:36,674
it's in my. House as am I. Might imagine
she's in there

3544
10:38:36,792 --> 10:38:39,835
inkifi eat

3545
10:38:44,380 --> 10:38:49,142
so yeah I would die for you to drop

3546
10:38:50,462 --> 10:38:54,478
what's that yeah

3547
10:38:55,391 --> 10:38:59,781
are they going to say Paul is image-based

3548
10:38:59,781 --> 10:39:08,645
yeah well I think that's that's where it's
going I think it is going towards images do
do you know if they got any of video
supporting here

3549
10:39:08,647 --> 10:39:13,354
a proportionate have you done any no teacher
discovery

3550
10:39:13,354 --> 10:39:24,498
he probably I don't know if you have or not
and I know it's it's only barely out of beta
it's pretty cool it's pretty cool you
probably have but if you haven't I'm just
curious

3551
10:39:24,498 --> 10:39:34,845
knowing Peter discovering a Jeep your future
discovery which is a beta it lets it let you
create a finiti rules for an increase sexual
tables that are based on CPU and something
up

3552
10:39:38,148 --> 10:39:44,732
Kevin doesn't need a discovery every
applications due

3553
10:39:46,169 --> 10:39:57,165
navigation developers wanted to cuz they
want to make sure they're running out of
each 100 Review 100 whatever the fuck they
want to be able to make sure that themselves
and they don't need it

3554
10:39:57,166 --> 10:40:04,156
I know all right well it's a different
question then we'll save it for later

3555
10:40:04,397 --> 10:40:33,102
and dr. Kirby images of pain is the drivers
in it for the Knicks visit or yes they have
they have they have their own Uber Hub by
towards stuff which is our stuff is all the
stuff is completely incompatible with the
Jupiter images I've been I've been dying for
them to get that because as well I kind of
went to bed now this is interesting

3556
10:40:33,105 --> 10:40:40,443
I've got a detection method senior IB 600
text message

3557
10:40:40,443 --> 10:40:48,409
this is one of our kind of surprised if you
register to terminal valid IP addresses to
choose from I'm going to need that

3558
10:40:49,163 --> 10:40:54,225
that was that was a good today to leave in
the dust

3559
10:40:54,225 --> 10:41:01,442
I'm sure I have all the savedvagrant destroy
so I don't blow my computer away

3560
10:41:09,168 --> 10:41:12,139
yes-siree-bob

3561
10:41:18,802 --> 10:41:20,857
commit skates

3562
10:41:25,545 --> 10:41:30,232
do do do pod Network cidr

3563
10:41:37,092 --> 10:41:41,590
there we go status

3564
10:41:45,137 --> 10:41:49,535
I can push with fish

3565
10:41:53,172 --> 10:41:57,035
And that's going to get a tag

3566
10:41:58,156 --> 10:42:04,242
golden I'm going to keep moving the golden
tag around anybody who actually

3567
10:42:04,961 --> 10:42:06,945
wants to

3568
10:42:07,751 --> 10:42:25,341
and I forgot I combined it with me
everything I mixed all my labs together now
so any of my foibles and and failures are in
The Labyrinth home so if you want to run a
vagrant from scratch

3569
10:42:25,626 --> 10:42:32,239
and get a working caretti's cluster by

3570
10:42:33,846 --> 10:42:57,097
with an f s support you can run this and we
haven't got CRCT I'll look and take her to
bed and then you just run in it here and you
run your joint in your dad for California
done I'll probably actually add those to the
steps and tomorrow I'm going to be adding a
storage interface Source plus I don't have
the storage place right now

3571
10:42:57,099 --> 10:43:04,179
so what kind of an fs-50 amount so I can
race components ATM what you did

3572
10:43:05,864 --> 10:43:11,881
and yeah control plane curious

3573
10:43:13,837 --> 10:43:18,687
okay then I could say if I hadn't seen the
filet

3574
10:43:20,350 --> 10:43:25,374
boy Calico see you and I

3575
10:43:27,388 --> 10:43:33,946
so they had ever hearing it pods warning

3576
10:43:34,747 --> 10:43:39,930
this step requires some careful

3577
10:43:41,518 --> 10:43:47,162
some care when working with vagrants

3578
10:43:47,162 --> 10:43:59,208
which has horrible networking and takes over
the defaults eth0 interface

3579
10:44:00,072 --> 10:44:04,950
all right and show me the worker nodes

3580
10:44:06,430 --> 10:44:13,424
why didn't you do this initialize kubernetes

3581
10:44:18,486 --> 10:44:21,023
it says control plane

3582
10:44:23,379 --> 10:44:26,813
plane with comedian

3583
10:44:30,243 --> 10:44:37,113
join the worker noses next Alpha Calico cni

3584
10:44:37,607 --> 10:44:48,210
Curtis tours class manifests and I will be
done with this so I can actually go back to
the text what I want to test so I can be
working on this

3585
10:44:48,503 --> 10:44:52,462
and I don't know if I'm going to do it
tonight or not what time is it

3586
10:44:52,927 --> 10:45:00,670
what time is it I probably stepped down God
damn it already

3587
10:45:01,930 --> 10:45:05,784
shut all right well I got to go to bed

3588
10:45:08,534 --> 10:45:15,595
we need to do stars class before I go does
anybody here have any links About Storage
classes that you would suggest

3589
10:45:38,180 --> 10:45:42,573
oh and lots of different things

3590
10:45:43,699 --> 10:45:51,132
it's so yeah what would y'all

3591
10:45:52,430 --> 10:46:00,392
think about that do what your buddies

3592
10:46:03,899 --> 10:46:10,522
reschensee and we talked about if you're not
even any filters you should you should be
good to go

3593
10:46:12,306 --> 10:46:18,405
is there anybody's this is Marquis it's over
here is

3594
10:46:18,822 --> 10:46:24,609
I I don't I don't how do you spell transfer
everything

3595
10:46:25,639 --> 10:46:31,059
yeah you should be using filters in that van
bench it at all

3596
10:46:32,363 --> 10:46:34,511
at 7 history mode

3597
10:46:37,158 --> 10:47:05,363
here is something you're supposed to rain in
Festus, Romans yes I heard that too it's not
a defense though when I'm trying to find his
son in a storage cost for my room and I
don't have that it so that's why I'm going
to start tomorrow I don't know what I'm
going to start but I'm going to start really
early I'm really need to get that done I've
got a ton of shit to get done for work and
the stuff is is not holding me back but
everything we've done has been essential has
been really really essential but I need to
start

3598
