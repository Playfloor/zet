1
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,820
I guess you can take some calls Listen
People

2
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:50,399
I might have any guests on the schedule
today I'm just going to go ahead and work on
some of my Organization for the the Boost
content while you guys while y'all are here

3
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:04,583
Sia 222

4
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,867
Burn Notice

5
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:38,560
I just made everything back to 12 cuz I'm
attending a 10 to sleep in on Saturday and
Sunday

6
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:41,791
cuz I said so I said till 7 a.m. today

7
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:52,870
can't help it so can I just do

8
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:31,077
when you look at it

9
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:39,291
I need to revisit what how we store data

10
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,857
I need to figure out how to store data

11
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:24,544
how to store data directly for for a
knowledge note

12
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,857
so we want to provide properties they start
your data properties for

13
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:38,139
something when it started hi Jerry I'm doing
pretty well

14
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,328
never know you should

15
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:54,814
there's an eighth there's not a 6 there's an
AMA are you talk about your Amy

16
00:06:55,651 --> 00:07:01,140
I have a 6 a.m. a nice

17
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,230
aa've cement can have an email as well

18
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:44,051
the kind of stuck onI'm stuck on this idea
about how we're going to stay

19
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:51,926
skills to a specific we're going to have
Labs or not

20
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:12,883
and what difference between the lab what the
difference between a lab and that a project
is an exercise

21
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,791
and how do we how do we capture those

22
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:32,294
how's it going so sorry I have a thing
already

23
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,093
have these language challenges

24
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:59,341
yeah I built that our language agnostic and

25
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:07,644
what's going on with Cher let me have so
when we

26
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,446
we have a language challenge

27
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,518
what where can I project in the lab yeah

28
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:23,932
yeah

29
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:32,044
I mean there's there's multiple definitions
allow that's kind of problems to a lab is
also

30
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:44,084
here is a bunch of things you can do to test
it out like here do the lab like through the
chem lab for this particular project in the
lab right they call it a lab because

31
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:52,495
because it's in Loudon but it is confusing
right is it technically they're their
projects right

32
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,493
so

33
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,197
so yeah

34
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:18,315
so that makes me wonder about that actually
it makes me wonder if we should just call it
a project be done

35
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,453
exit polling mini projects

36
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:30,988
they are projects a project is like hey
here's a project right go to these things

37
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,660
what's the difference between a challenge
and a project would you say

38
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:45,838
when he hears hears our words that were
talking about here we have

39
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,536
I got two terms MD

40
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:03,432
so we have all these words that we use a lot
and I kind of want to get a handle on what
they are

41
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:11,195
so we have project we have live

42
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,964
we have yeah

43
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:24,606
less is more yes Avon

44
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:30,233
yeah I can't have a hard time moving on

45
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:36,154
because this is going to be codified in
thousands of things

46
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:46,189
I have an exercise we have a project we have
a task

47
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:55,628
and you're allowed right

48
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:58,382
cell

49
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:08,573
I think an exercise is a repeatable

50
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:17,212
set of tasks seriously defy

51
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:24,324
proficiencyright

52
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:34,818
and a task is an execution of a skill

53
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,403
and a skill

54
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:48,012
play I like actions right

55
00:12:53,676 --> 00:13:00,361
and I still a set of actions

56
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:11,143
organized to produce

57
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:18,344
specific result nice place for this equate
to my functions.

58
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:41,979
Ayo

59
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:58,000
say if we compare

60
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:07,927
I really just really humans here

61
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:25,187
in fact several tracked correlations in
terminology

62
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:31,996
can be made Tweenies

63
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:35,967
terms and programme

64
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:53,188
so you could say up your burger is it going
to recur

65
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,572
so I can say an action is a statement

66
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,151
and I mean

67
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,712
askill okay

68
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:43,595
I think I got a lot of this photo to

69
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,872
cereal

70
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:07,610
I should hate you both

71
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,409
where do you have a skill

72
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:20,366
a skill is akin to a procedure not a
function

73
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:41,028
so a task is

74
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,961
a procedure called with arguments

75
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,706
exercise

76
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:21,472
I think it's a troll probably

77
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,139
exercise

78
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:37,075
Etsy hell to exercise what is exercise is

79
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:49,757
that's kind of a attest ribbon stuff right

80
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:09,344
can we find that matches at repeatable
combination

81
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,431
all skills

82
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,526
and exercise is the

83
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:31,938
pacification of

84
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:38,456
several

85
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:50,252
a group of tasks designed to solidify

86
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:59,126
learning true repetition

87
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,388
don't do that

88
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:14,229
I still see his memory of how to do a
certain set of tasks well

89
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:22,292
description would be a specific set of
actions to produce a result

90
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,404
yep well that's what a skill is

91
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:40,603
memory of how to do a certain set of tasks
well

92
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:48,771
yep still as still as the coating is the
coding

93
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:54,551
to do a thing a task and a task is doing the
thing

94
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:55,390
yeah if you if you if you go while I pursue
a covid

95
00:20:56,817 --> 00:21:01,225
so the reason that

96
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:06,972
I finally concluded that it's killing a
tasker at the same level of scope

97
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:15,096
is because they both can be broken down and
both can be broken down into actions into
other

98
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:10,784
Skillet yeah yeah it's still as still as the
implementation of

99
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,596
strictly speaking a skill is does not tell
you how to do it

100
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:29,636
this is important so the skill would be

101
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:36,852
set up an NFS server right

102
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:46,573
it doesn't tell you how to set up an FS
server it just says you need to set up an FS
server and that's an operation

103
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,436
a task

104
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:25,461
play FNAF SL

105
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:39,874
so since he's so procedures or Apparition
with framers so we're missing is the method

106
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,101
and this is a word that actually directly
translates

107
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:22,388
so you can have those say Lucy you have
roundhouse kick right now so you have a Kik

108
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:37,272
you can roundhouse kick you can front kick
there's a million ways to say you have walk
so walking toward of the ability but let's
say let's say walking was a mug let's say
walking was

109
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:42,884
a skill if walking is a skill

110
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,708
then the name of the scale would be walk and
maybe you know

111
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:59,712
the method of walking could be any number of
things and a task would be walk to the store

112
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:19,360
and then you would employ you would use your
walk skill it's actually a billy but you do
use a walk skill following the method that
you had implemented to do walk and then you
would go there and you did so there's so
that's yeah I'm getting it I'm getting out
of that we're getting it this

113
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:35,496
I have a stable That's My Method what do you
mean by that will that's my method of doing
whatever right

114
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:22,366
other skills so the

115
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,879
so the skill is akin to an operation it's
it's the top little thing

116
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:39,810
and an action is just doing something it's
not necessarily a skill but it is strictly
speaking if you could call it a skill as
well like

117
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:45,781
never take a bite from a fork that's a skill

118
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:59,894
and believe it or not those are skills that
are covered in like you know accessibility
called courses up like that they actually
consider those skills training like me no
motor skills are literally called motor
skills so

119
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:23,060
you know and those skills are composed of
actions like to take a bath with a fork in
me and you know that it's like lift up your
hand touched before to pick up the fork of
the field to Fork into the food and you move
it your all of those little tiny actions to
combine together to create a skill like you
know eat some seafood with a fork

120
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:30,072
and that's a skill so it has an instruction
set right

121
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:34,246
I think I think that's really what it is

122
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:48,671
give me the other questions everybody I'm
here for a May time as well so

123
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:32,791
exercise is kind of like a unit test yeah
that was the first thing that came to mind

124
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,103
that was the first thing that came to mind
was like a it's kind of like a unit test

125
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:56,246
type inquiring research in critical thinking
of those are all skills there's a there's a
critical thinking is a tough one though
there's a nebulous line between a skill and
an ability

126
00:28:56,247 --> 00:29:22,343
and I have a really really hard time
distinguishing the to some of them are
really easy to distinguish those some
abilities are innate like your ability to
see you can't learn to see right that's not
something you can learn so and blue I mean
abilities are required for work then a
little left of the 300 lb right that's an
ability that you can obtain

127
00:29:22,522 --> 00:29:40,173
and that's not necessarily a skeleton
ability that you can you can obtain there
are certain buildings you cannot obtain
though it's like I will never be a fighter
pilot there's no way because the occupation
of fighter pilot demands the ability to See
20/20 without correction

128
00:29:40,175 --> 00:30:01,315
and users wasting for your practice surgery
and stuff like that but that bilities are
not things that you can easily change and
that would be a professional Sportsman right
so that's I really think it's important that
we distinguish between abilities and skills
there are some abilities so if something is
sometimes there's an ability that borders on

129
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:05,570
ask you don't like typing me a lot about her
20 words a minute

130
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:21,298
right is that a skill or is it an ability
you know what you don't have hands it's you
know dinner that's part of its inability you
can't you can't learn a skill if you don't
have the base of Billy so

131
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,765
you know using a keyboard for example that
would be an ability that's not a skill

132
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:49,932
you know I mean it so I know I'm getting
financing about this but this is the time to
be pedantic because we're producing a model
on which all of our other stuff is going to
be built and I want to get it right I'm
going to get right I've been I've been
stressing over this for years more of that
decade actually it's kind of nice to come
back to it

133
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:56,000
because if we cuz we we we want to fix

134
00:30:56,792 --> 00:31:02,251
the ability for people to track their skills
and and

135
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:25,592
and and look up skills are required to
perform Church certain occupations which is
at the end of the day and occupation is just
a collection of skills knowledge and
abilities and that's that's the
specification of occupation it is what you
need to do for occupation and you should be
able to drill down and and look up labs for
all that stuff

136
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:36,449
I wish you nothing but knowledge here
ability

137
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:53,848
one or more actions that require

138
00:31:54,888 --> 00:32:00,391
innate or

139
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:08,126
difficult to learn natural ability

140
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:15,609
seeing lifting 100 lb

141
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,401
walking

142
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:51,321
I think you need a Milanese to be listed
here just this is just a brainstorming
session right here

143
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:55,634
right I just bring some recession

144
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:04,698
I'm glad we did this comparison to software
that because of skill really isn't a skill
as it is the outer shell

145
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:08,966
and the method is the nitty gritty

146
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,278
and the task is a single execution of that
so

147
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:52,682
critical thinking is definitely important
absolutely

148
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:05,152
a scale really is DM specification

149
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:15,587
a predictable result

150
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:22,053
I'm giving a certain set of parameters can
include other skills

151
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:29,788
I definitely know that's what this is

152
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:51,658
Miss skill is the interface and the method
is the implementation of the interface and
just like in software development interfaces
are verbs

153
00:34:52,850 --> 00:35:00,671
right I am thinking independently one of my
life with you

154
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:46,997
which is now in a very tiny one that in the
90s really

155
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:55,177
so the scale is the specification
predictable result

156
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,444
with requirements

157
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:20,239
play the measurable requirements

158
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:32,430
when provided with

159
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:41,964
specific parameters I'm going to say this
testable

160
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:52,954
it's a testable specification of a
predictable result with me with measurable
outcomes on Friday with specific parameters
without specifying how the result is to be
obtained

161
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,372
that's that is that Nails it that's exactly
what his skill is that's what his skill is

162
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:06,152
no details for the implementation
implementation is

163
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:19,038
our choice the reason is so important is
because as we specified skills we go through
labs and stuff they're going to be many ways
to fulfill that skill

164
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,861
and

165
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:35,087
my way is going to be different in your way
and you're going to make a write-up of how
you did it and how you accomplished it and
your way might be more efficient than my way
both of them get to the end right and

166
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:40,866
so to put their desires in a Wiki yes

167
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:45,992
absolutely and that that's you're basically
having them specify that

168
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:57,016
is the teaching is it just like you show me
telling what we need to learn to write like
you'd be with him giving a little task
feedback positive enforcement till I get to

169
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:59,222
as a means by mentor

170
00:37:59,915 --> 00:38:06,798
he should be better is kind of expected of
you to know everything to be able to love
yourself yeah

171
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,466
yeah it is

172
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:36,962
well okay so did you fare there's actually
want to just when I've been making to the to
the to the Moose this year this is something
I've learned over the years particular since
these last two years as I start streaming
you started it with so many different people
is the beginner boost is going to be well I
put it this way

173
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:40,641
I call it phases

174
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:45,139
yeah you can call out hodgepodge

175
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:51,350
I mean you can call it bullshit whenever but

176
00:38:54,075 --> 00:38:58,349
phases are stages and call it stages that
looks like last

177
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:08,487
so alright so

178
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:15,754
I really think that there are three

179
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:20,608
stages to learning there's preparation where
you need lots of hand-holding

180
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:42,715
yeah I see you on the stage exactly we
talked about that there's preparation and
that's where you have an intense amount of
hand-holding because people aren't used to
it and then you have programming which is
sort of a separate thing and then you have
projects is the main one in professional so

181
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:45,807
and I said I mean by that so I can few

182
00:39:46,424 --> 00:40:02,584
projects you can do with others you can do
by yourself at the bottom line is you when
you first start out when you started helping
some people think of your mentoring you need
you need to kind of be there for them or you
need to let them up more and

183
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:07,403
that's that's what I'm going to try to do
with the universe

184
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:16,251
there's a there's one bit of tweaking I had
to do every year it's I've had to do more
and more hand-holding

185
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:22,829
proper planning and preparation prevents
piss-poor performance so so

186
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:32,166
and the problem with this is if you do if
you continue to hold their hand to the level
it when they first beginning they will never
learn to learn

187
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:42,727
so I might approach on that 27-piece my
Approach on this is that you should kind of
step back and

188
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:49,884
at some point you can stroll them do their
thing and that's where projects come in
right

189
00:40:50,845 --> 00:41:06,396
so so yeah a boost to me is is handling and
we're going to hand hold your help your hand
hold your hand for the basic stuff and get
to get you excited about it and then
hopefully you pick it up and go off on your
own

190
00:41:06,612 --> 00:41:18,057
is it one of the things that I struggle with
forever is teaching people how to learn I
think it's he will say hey go to college and
learn how to learn do you want you going to
college in the people who've already learned
how to learn to survive the rest dropout

191
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:34,065
and that's the problem and people have been
people you know say oh hey if you made it
through college you learn how to learn and
even if it was a liberal arts degree you're
going to be a great employee because you
went to college it's really unfair because

192
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:49,961
a lot of those people who didn't make it
through college never learned how to learn
or they did learn how to learn their work it
was an innate thing that's what Ken Robinson
says and it was beat out of them now so I
can Robinson's this and I never recovered it
which is a fucking tragedy actually is so

193
00:41:50,513 --> 00:42:12,797
might I haven't figured out how to do this
other than to be available for people and to
elect them be free to explore and discover
their own method of learning at the problem
with you cannot you cannot write a book or
create a method that teaches people how to
learn you can't do it

194
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:19,416
because every single person learns
differently there are certain things in
common obviously

195
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:24,740
every single person learns differently and
I'm going to psych Ken Robinson on that
again

196
00:42:25,483 --> 00:42:43,545
I'm going to say I can Robinson Ken Robinson
talks about you know that was her face so
you can graduate Art Academy she was failing
out of our school classes they put her in a
kinetic school dance school where people
moved around while they were doing their
math or whatever and she just took off
because the they let the learning
environment was adapted to the person

197
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,072
have to be in business yam so

198
00:42:51,368 --> 00:43:20,385
and this is something I've struggled with
forever I think the natural it feels very
loose and disorganized when people came to
school sick because they come in and yes we
have you know lessons and stuff like that
and products that we work on together and
stuff but a lot of the people that are in
the in the room are not classroom Learners
and so some of the more I would stand back
and just say hey there's a project we're
working on this working at together we're
here to help you when they would do that

199
00:43:21,038 --> 00:43:26,256
learning new stuff while yeah I kind of
think that's the reason we're alive first
lie

200
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:30,679
I think the reasons is this goal of life is
learning.

201
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:38,191
So it's easy for me to get religious sleeve
you know it feels spell softball about it

202
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:45,209
getting old score old holder nothing like
that

203
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:53,352
yeah right after dye yeah well that's life

204
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:59,461
I mean that's what nature is about prazosin

205
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,513
yeah

206
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:13,407
yeah it's so

207
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:25,769
but the hardest part really honestly the
hardest part is creating a system for
everybody to learn when every single person
is different I think trying to create a
single diet for All Humans

208
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:45,703
there's certain things that will kill some
people and that that and I'll make other
people very healthy just every single person
is different and we have to treat people as
individuals and organizing content in such a
with such you know reality is very hard it's
very very hard

209
00:44:45,705 --> 00:45:02,316
and the best you can do is share things
that'll work for you and create a community
where people can discover other people who
have similar situations and follow on the
health parallel you know you have diabetics
and I made a community where is FODMAP
issues you know how

210
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:19,100
did you know on their intestinal tract works
if only somebody else become my support
group for you to go and switching you find
people that are obsessed with the terminal
if you like you don't learn command lines
and skills so I think the best way to go
forward is to create opportunities for
people through community

211
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:29,638
and then they can do the learning on their
own but the question originally was Will
what it what if you just get left on that in
the you know is teaching

212
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:40,207
showing and telling what they need to learn
learn to write or you like be with him give
him a little task feedback positive
enforcement till he gets it

213
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:48,202
buy mint Oreo it's also important to know
that I meant or is not a personal trainer

214
00:45:49,933 --> 00:46:17,495
afraid you can do it that's that's not my
definition of mentor every single Mentor
however is different in every personality is
different than theirs drill sergeant Mentor
going to fucking yell in your face and spit
at you and then there's there's mention
they're going to give you a name an okay
let's try that you know they're going to
give you a hug after everything and there's
different types of mentors and personalities
and that's and learning styles and that's
why I think mentorship is so important

215
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:39,502
because you're going to you're going to
connect with another human who happens to
have the skills that you need and you're
going to learn from them and that's that's
mentorship that's what it is and trying to
say that all Mentor should be like this or
that is stupid because that's not how all
people are

216
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:48,506
and social aspect

217
00:46:49,568 --> 00:47:36,642
like I'll do it so I got into the world and
trying to do it and there are some drop out
since you seen a little life it mean if your
hair but yeah that's what measuring is he
has are generally there to encourage you and
motivate you and help you answer your little
little problems ain't the first time people
hear about Metro they usually think of it
like a businessman torbett business mentors
are big right senior Executive Vice
Presidents and stuff like that and they
usually have a mentor somebody who's really
experienced and they're also in business and
they they go to him to give them their SOB
stories and and lean on them and they give
him the courage minutes and stuff like that
it's not like Yoda right then but there's
other measures that are more of a Toyota you
know Master roll

218
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:43,298
I try my best to teach him stuff what's that

219
00:47:45,411 --> 00:48:26,639
now he has his own team yeah there you go
that's how it works is that humans have been
doing it since the dawn of time just before
we had the school's is before we had schools
this is how humans learn they were naturally
built to learn this way and to share our
learning with others you watch it says I saw
a documentary on something about the
swimming about the distinction between the
Animal Kingdom in humans and it made some
pretty strong comparisons before making a
distinction about about different species
and one of the things they show that just
blew me away was the primates teaching other
primates how to open coconuts and stuff like
that

220
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:48,070
and how do they do it they do it primates
teach each other and then they drew the
distinction that the reason that the
primates haven't exceeded our level of
intelligence is because of one thing the
ability to pass on generational knowledge
and record it so as soon as humans figured
out how to capture knowledge and writing

221
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,967
we fucking blew up we blew up

222
00:48:52,967 --> 00:49:04,962
we blew up and we took over every other
thing level of intelligence because now it
was exponential now the learning from one
generation could pass on to the next
generation without them being there to show
them how to do it

223
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:42,258
and as soon as we invented writing as soon
as Humanity invented writing weed we just
took over we took over everything else but
before that and still today the learning
that happens is a very direct thing I give
you yours I just remember the scene it had
to primates I don't know what type of monkey
they were they were they were literally
showing each other how to do it there like
okay I'm going to do it now and then they
would stop and then the other one would take
it up birds do this to there's a there's a
particular bird

224
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:48,774
the particular bird that has to learn how to
sing to win over the girls

225
00:49:49,271 --> 00:50:41,669
and it will have a mentor singer hang out
with him and then we'll also get a posse of
like a backup singers is the craziest there
is so much fun there's this this is if you
ever get a chance to look it up it's so
hilarious it's hilarious there's like a girl
bird and she's sitting there and the guy
bird comes up and he's like trying to court
her right and he'll have the Guyver the yeah
the guy version will have like a backup
singers that are there to help him and the
backup singers aren't there to get the girl
they're there to back him up so he's singing
and then the backup singers are helping him
saying but the backup singers are learning
how to sing it So eventually they're going
to be going to be the lead singers and their
own thing and so the Virgin is so fucking
occurred cute it's just for the music but
that Sound Nature passes on knowledge

226
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:47,423
Nature has been mentoring since nature
existed

227
00:50:50,271 --> 00:51:10,524
this is how knowledge is passed on between
animals in the animal kingdom as well as
human indifference the only difference is
that we teach kids to ask your kid I was
like watching Jessica or whatever the
Russian yesterday and I are watching how the
Russians articulate the words they're not
thinking about what they're saying

228
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:35,000
they're just saying it because they have
been mimicking the people are around a fact
about Linguistics in the best way to get to
learn Linguistics is to immerse yourself why
because then you get to mimic everything
you're around all the people that you're
around your mimicking them and mimicking and
repetition is the way to learn that's the
that's the real way to learn that's how
humans I've been learning at our species any
species that passes on know and that's how
they do it

229
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:51,329
they don't have some fancy asks you how do
you write a constitution that you know it's
it's through its through mentorship and
mimicking an apprenticeship and and help me
that's how learning happens it always happen
it's the most natural way to do learning

230
00:51:51,518 --> 00:51:59,755
through experimentation and through
mimicking and and being with somebody who
knows or something that knows

231
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:02,201
and so

232
00:52:02,478 --> 00:52:12,544
the thing is great about that is it you can
always adapted to your needs monkey see
monkey do absolutely we laughing about this
but is totally true

233
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:25,836
when when you can basically throughout the
entire fucking formal academic institutions
of of the world and you can say actually all
you really need to do is do with the monkey
zoo

234
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:41,549
go tell go tell that to your theoretically
pedantic bombastic piece of shit overly
verbose professors in college go tell them
that you know what I can replace you with a
monkey

235
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:47,232
who actually knows how to do something
that's valuable that's going to get me some
food to eat

236
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:52,295
that's like the biggest insult ever

237
00:52:52,296 --> 00:53:04,924
if anything the whole academic fuck up is is
the extreme end of what has made us Superior
to all the other species

238
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:11,461
Astoria it's made it so Superior to all the
other species is because

239
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:17,048
if you think about it what what was the
thing that first separated us

240
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:20,305
yeah

241
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:30,136
what was the thing that four separate is
from the other species as well according to
that one documentary the one thing was the
written word and generational learning

242
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:43,745
in terms of knowledge as to did the
knowledge and theory is I think that right
so I would go I would go so far as to say
that the written word was the invention of
theory

243
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:47,463
as soon as we started to be able to write
about things

244
00:53:47,521 --> 00:54:12,079
the writing was no longer do this then do
this then do this it wasn't recipes for how
to do something like you would like it would
create if you were with the person or thing
it became hey and here's maybe why you're
doing this right and communicate yeah and so
I would say that writing was the beginning
of the end of Education because

245
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:22,385
it was also necessary obviously but the
extreme end of the ability to write is what
you get when you pay $80 for

246
00:54:21,396 --> 00:54:43,406
for an academic text that you're forced to
buy by an academic who thinks that that's
the only way you should ever be and you
should pursue you should pursue just
academic learning theory as for the rest of
your life and that is the end goal and gives
a shit about her going to make money why
don't you go work at the restaurant while
you're you know studying these really
esoteric crazy ass things that are in this
$80 book that I forced you to buy

247
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:58,990
so it's like the opposite extreme is the
opposite of screaming obviously the solution
is somewhere in the middle you have to have
a certain amount of of reading and theory
and stuff like that combined with the
practical application of those things
against me

248
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:09,491
I'm reading writing is an extension World
communication but it is voice in your head
telling story absolutely and that's actually
how I like the right actually

249
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:18,183
US 22 is what are the most popular books
when when you when you need to learn
something fast

250
00:55:18,627 --> 00:55:24,203
and it's a little dated and now but what was
the most popular technical book craze

251
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:27,067
what was it you guys remember

252
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:34,949
and heinous

253
00:55:37,406 --> 00:55:45,339
and aren't xxs in 24 hours and here's
another series you guys remember this the
dummies series

254
00:55:46,182 --> 00:55:55,237
remember the dummies series like Karate For
Dummies and and you know recipes for dummies
and pearl for dummies and

255
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:00,218
when was the dummies book why were the
dummies books so wildly successful

256
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:10,772
I'll tell you why Cliff Notes yeah XXX for
dummies and Cliff tells the reason they're
wildly successful is because they're
practical

257
00:56:12,474 --> 00:56:16,017
they're totally practical

258
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:34,066
his books are popular because why is this
somebody was just saying that you see
writing is an extension of oral
communication will there you go there's the
proof in the pudding how many people go to
the Barnes & Noble bookstore wherever their
books or is and ask for an eighty-dollar
text book on data structures and algorithms

259
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:38,736
are there some good there's a definitely
good content about how many people go there
and get that

260
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:45,679
this is a good a good distinction to the
book I wrote data structures in C

261
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:57,041
throws out all that theory shit doesn't have
it in it and it's as much than her book and
it has just a practical application of data
structures and algorithms much better book
it feels to me more

262
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,334
and the Java for dummies

263
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:08,058
are is your processor absolutely yeah if you
if you if you read the dummies books what
are they

264
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:15,348
the most popular book series for O'Reilly in
the most popular book series among all those
other ones it's the recipe books

265
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:29,260
it's the recipe books and then do this and
then do this books and what are those this
is actually getting back to our turn the
terminology stuff because the books that
tell you how to do a thing

266
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:37,910
and a nice clear way are the most popular
because they give you skill they give you a
power they don't do your eyes about why it's
valuable

267
00:57:38,197 --> 00:57:45,498
yeah they've changed a lot I know O'Reilly's
going downhill I'm not going to lie I agree

268
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:56,817
text message I got through college on Cliff
Notes I had a Russian major

269
00:57:57,442 --> 00:58:32,559
did they assigned us the volume of
retreating in Russian that they assign is
our senior year there was no fucking way and
the professors knew we couldn't read it they
knew we couldn't really they signed it
anyway because it was on the given her
credit a she made him look good it was like
it was like a dirty little secret that
nobody was going to ever read a thousands
and thousands of pages that they gave us no
one was going to be able to read it and no
one talked about it and they make sure
people got to use anyway but you know it was
all kinds of you know ways to survive that
had nothing to do with it

270
00:58:32,562 --> 00:59:02,129
and it was just it was disastrous I know we
would have a conversation about it and then
they would did that the professor to make
sure to tell us about the stuff we were
going to talk about they say okay we're
going to talk about this so that we can read
at least that so the class was not a
complete waste so we can read that lease
that part most of the people by the time
they were seniors and Russian part part
cookie the fucking read Russian they still
can read it there's t-shirts in Russian and
they couldn't read you know Russia in and
then when you know because I need a ride or
whatever it is War and Peace

271
00:59:01,028 --> 00:59:09,209
Warren peace because Anya I can remember
what you mean yeah. It was just it was
terrifying so

272
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:16,465
YouTube is educational. Yeah I think yeah
yeah

273
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:28,934
yeah I got no see no educational content on
YouTube definitely taking a text to cut up a
notch and lots of space Khan Academy right

274
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:36,686
I really just like button has been
tremendous how can I sell people been
complaining about that but I don't know why

275
01:00:16,643 --> 01:00:17,901
what's up

276
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:28,886
I've seen several Bosch books bash things
lately

277
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:41,030
and I can't approve any of them so far other
than the bash main page

278
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:49,552
it does look pretty good though and the
primary expense is missing a ton of stuff

279
01:00:55,378 --> 01:01:01,526
yeah the single brackets and that would make
me throw it out the fucking window
immediately

280
01:01:01,977 --> 01:01:07,062
I would never use this it's missing really
basic stuff

281
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:21,013
is it just makes me so I got to do about
book I have to do bad content and we're
going to go to the bathroom and now so
people can see why this is so bad if you
ever use single brackets and Bash you are
feeling

282
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:33,736
I'm sorry I'm going to say it you can hate
me for saying so it's true single single
brackets and Bash well-supported are fucking
unnecessarily dangerous if you don't know
why go learn why

283
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:48,582
I know it's not in Bosch but yeah that's an

284
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:54,470
it's one of the most misunderstood things in
all of shell scripting

285
01:01:55,456 --> 01:01:58,242
that Chelsea is pretty good

286
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:17,519
yeah if you do single brackets they're
totally bad do the research and understand
the difference I'm not going to tell you why
but the short answer is the single brackets
Dukes could do expansion that the gloves
start mansion and double brackets do not
which is why double brackets can contain
regular expression matches without any
quoting

287
01:02:18,993 --> 01:02:27,978
strictly speaking you don't need to do a lot
of quoting in double brackets you still need
to when you have a variable that you're
going to be matching

288
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:39,416
and by the way if you can get away with it
if you're doing if you drink numeric
comparison you shouldn't be doing double
brackets either you should be doing double
parentheses because it forces everything
into an American text

289
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:42,820
and that's even safer

290
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:58,414
how many when's the last time you saw
anybody actually use double parentheses I do
bass change last time but it's not a bad
stream if you want to learn bass just go to
the main page and do what it says

291
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:07,686
I try to be mean that's just that's just
Nobody Does it

292
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:14,545
nobody doesn't there's tons of like really
unsafe reduction coaches great if your
hacker oh my God

293
01:04:29,562 --> 01:04:31,098
Coronavirus

294
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:43,055
show us in Discord why what's going on
something bad happening

295
01:04:45,652 --> 01:04:52,041
I know this is been a lot more commenting
lately or am I missing

296
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:06,620
you want to ask a question of the stage or
on the stage and I can't see you you're such
a raise your hand

297
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:16,475
oh you going to Henry sorry yes please
invite to speak

298
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:24,645
sorry I missed you hi there

299
01:05:25,851 --> 01:05:33,577
is my voice yeah that sounds really great to
me probably for everybody else but sounds
great

300
01:05:36,952 --> 01:05:42,961
yeah you're fine it's it's on my side I have
I have to adjust volume to seven you're good

301
01:05:51,885 --> 01:06:01,001
what kind of certificate authorities would
you select

302
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:11,744
Handel soul in the hole. Oh I think that's a
great question and I don't have an answer

303
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:23,506
yeah yeah

304
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:37,400
absolutely yeah I just wanted to say that I
was just thinking about this

305
01:06:37,984 --> 01:07:38,397
knowing about certificates just so nobody
else is listening and knowing about
certificates is a core infrastructure
engineering skill today and it's not it's
not just for web server is micro Services
any more certificates are used everywhere
and if you don't know about them and I don't
know the last time I did anything with
certificates was in my garden 97h and
actually you know we went to verisign and we
had to apply to get a certificate and it
took forever I noticed this when I started
doing Cube ATM for kubernetes it creates a
plethora mean how many certificates for you
and we've been burned by having certificates
expire tributaries because we didn't manage
certificates internally and then there's the
question of what when when do you use a
self-signed certificate do you use a
certificate across your entire Enterprise a
certificate

306
01:07:38,402 --> 01:08:14,943
have you know these things like associations
parent-child kind of things and they
ultimately have is a CA like he's asking
about and the truth is I don't have a handle
on it right now I I have a general idea of
what certificates are used for and how they
they're issued and what a c a is and all
that but but when it comes down to best
practices for managing time or making your
own I feel really messy on that front I
don't I honestly don't have you know I'm it
and then there's the whole problem will do
you trust your ca at all

307
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:19,217
right what's what series do you use

308
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:27,223
sure

309
01:08:32,393 --> 01:08:36,482
and McKnight let me turn my music down okay
yeah

310
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:49,294
I do know of it it's been a long time since
I worked with it you're talking about just
general DNS yeah

311
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:54,726
yeah no

312
01:08:58,745 --> 01:09:03,356
I want to try yeah

313
01:09:05,422 --> 01:09:21,027
how can you read to me yeah

314
01:09:23,735 --> 01:09:28,988
completely supported check

315
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,977
take me there on Denison

316
01:09:43,019 --> 01:09:44,234
yeah

317
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:56,660
where is area code for a certificate
Authority and how can you know that this
wasn't too many too late for drinking like
that

318
01:10:00,478 --> 01:10:12,409
how can I go to a dealership with the main
thing is I can somehow use Affliction as a
way to receive

319
01:10:14,106 --> 01:10:44,297
now

320
01:10:49,648 --> 01:10:52,049
is completely well

321
01:10:53,863 --> 01:11:04,271
that's that's amazing yeah that's been
needed that hasn't needed to be fixed for so
long

322
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,246
yeah

323
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:44,795
yeah because you could just use the same I
mean I know people use DNS for validation of
other things like like email right so
there's all kinds of extra DNS text records
that people have now for validating you know
email and email providers but I'm not aware
of anything until now that validates the DNS
query itself to make sure it hasn't been
messed with

324
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:59,120
yeah s p f n t x e but that's that's that's
always been a problem with Tony what Tony
fall is here Tony has talked about this
problem before

325
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:08,243
DNS maybe that's it a good use of blockchain
I don't know I wonder

326
01:12:14,047 --> 01:12:15,692
absolutely

327
01:12:18,692 --> 01:12:45,386
yeah and I think that's fine as is yeah I
don't know if we I would really like to see
the numbers on what if every single DNS
query in the world use this technology what
would that do what would the impact be if
literally every web request use this

328
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:52,768
yeah him

329
01:12:56,132 --> 01:12:57,244
what you're doing right now

330
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:32,459
if you are to the right certificates that is
used to write it's not miss you as though it
has been expired and it's not the right to
me

331
01:13:32,943 --> 01:13:34,070
interesting

332
01:13:36,552 --> 01:13:54,433
that is so cool I really like it I mean we
need more people thinking about how to fix
the in us for sure that's Remains the single
point of failure for most major hacks you
know

333
01:13:54,485 --> 01:14:01,702
I can take it over is that that's that's
super interesting you provided a link to
that so can we can go look at it read about
it

334
01:14:04,742 --> 01:14:09,359
I just finished LOL

335
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,981
yeah

336
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:44,080
yeah I think you should probably should
definitely bounce that off Tony fought who
is spent a lot of time researching the the
the the security space for that also they
specifically mentioned DNS in some of the
work that they're doing so and Shake uses
concept it's proof on the Block chain for a
t l d and you can create as many shelters as
you want with auctions interesting

337
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:49,479
I ain't heard of that one yeah

338
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,381
yeah

339
01:14:57,178 --> 01:15:09,485
had to come up with anything in this rain

340
01:15:20,832 --> 01:15:25,356
certificate

341
01:15:31,418 --> 01:15:32,936
yeah

342
01:15:44,058 --> 01:15:48,341
I guess that would be that would be your you
whatever your

343
01:15:48,342 --> 01:16:07,183
was it time to live you have to figure a way
to bust the cash that's still a problem with
DNS today right is the records take so long
to update but but they are cashed though so
so the blockchain wouldn't be bringing any
overly

344
01:16:07,413 --> 01:16:23,303
I wouldn't add latency because most of DNS
transactions are cashed so that one time you
would have to get it a new one it would it
would be slower but how much more so I don't
know I'll be adventurous things to see

345
01:16:23,305 --> 01:16:24,793
Hanson

346
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:33,002
yeah

347
01:16:36,390 --> 01:17:01,882
you can have this we can use this with it's
been over to connect them secure and you
don't have to break a chain of trust and
it's very cheap rent

348
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:12,724
yeah yeah that yeah I mean if you could if
you can figure out some way to

349
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:16,838
I don't know I got to

350
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:37,329
the abstract the communication so that use
blockchain as a method of distribution as
you said and allowed another method of
distribution as well you know some people
can adapt but I don't know that that's
that's very very ambitious This Is Us
awesome to think about

351
01:17:41,716 --> 01:17:46,686
the infrastructure problem which
infrastructure problem

352
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:55,654
yes right

353
01:18:04,742 --> 01:18:11,983
him how would you know that they be honest
is writing to that quiet certificate

354
01:18:12,423 --> 01:18:13,498
yeah

355
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:36,389
however I do I hope yeah well God knows we
need that we need to get off the certificate
authorities that has to be

356
01:18:37,036 --> 01:19:05,321
a tie-dye book I agree I think that's a
problem be saying that we have that's always
been a problem by the way you know when
verisign it was the Monopoly in the universe
in the 90s and nobody got a certificate
unless you bow down and paid your $600 and
beg them to give you a certificate you
didn't get one and we do have you know free
let's encrypt

357
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:10,162
and things like that for but do we want to
trust them you know I don't know

358
01:19:10,522 --> 01:19:14,925
hey I don't know how you can get rid of that
problem of trust

359
01:19:15,435 --> 01:19:18,961
and shakes all this is well at the bar chain
Indiana sec

360
01:19:19,264 --> 01:19:25,664
interesting building a secure website on
your handshake tell d interesting

361
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,168
I haven't read about this at all yet

362
01:19:30,827 --> 01:20:12,373
if you never lost a website on a legacy
internet the process like this search for
available memorable name on Cotati and rent
it from the movie girls if you're getting a
DNS off GoDaddy you are doing it wrong I'm
just going to tell you right now I'm I know
GoDaddy I'm going to try to avoid a side
tangent but I know I'm GoDaddy literally
taking people's domains hostage they are
like the mafia of DNS people ocean droplet
named chief is better than they're getting
kind of bad joker was the one I've always
loved their from Germany

363
01:20:12,956 --> 01:20:16,607
ocean droplet other cloud service and get an
IP address

364
01:20:19,907 --> 01:20:28,757
go to go there and pay c i p go to server
and let's encrypt to assert bought which is
what I do I set up Apache

365
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:34,779
your demesne and SSL certificate from sef4
don't really belong to you

366
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:44,022
both assets can be revoked at any time and
have by the way this is why I used to buy
stuff from from Germany and Joker. Com

367
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:57,705
they didn't have a history of turning over
to main ownership without asking to America
and other authorities both digital assets
can be revoked anytime

368
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:05,254
I see you I just need a house reference
interesting

369
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:10,842
the Legacy process also conceals a lot of
the DNS stuff that is actually required

370
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:21,641
entrust them to host your name server for
your records fuck no I don't do that and a
handshake I don't do that I put my
nameservers someplace else I always do that

371
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:30,009
handshake replaces DNS and Trust
proof-of-work secures our relationship

372
01:21:30,009 --> 01:21:34,777
between the domain name and the two
important sounds like you're doing something
somewhere

373
01:21:39,464 --> 01:22:06,160
it is yeah it's ya the name server lives at
that IP address and serves as soon as dating
yeah I mean I think people need to
understand this Adam a name can be
confiscated by your country anytime they
want and they can take over everything they
can take over all your traffic and
everything you do if

374
01:22:15,106 --> 01:22:16,614
yes oh my God yes

375
01:22:23,586 --> 01:22:31,108
control the whole movie oh wow absolutely

376
01:22:32,142 --> 01:22:33,372
yeah

377
01:22:34,197 --> 01:22:45,886
so

378
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:54,586
yes yep that is totally true

379
01:22:55,306 --> 01:23:13,286
that is totally true and if teas are yeah
it's the scarcity in the control that makes
it so valuable insane and that's why people
sit on them to sell them because they
WhatsApp

380
01:23:22,105 --> 01:23:23,230
oh well

381
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:38,976
now wow that this is this is a big deal

382
01:23:39,468 --> 01:23:47,252
yeah this at this DNS stuff is I think it's
one of the last pieces you know

383
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,494
of that of the old internet to really be

384
01:23:50,842 --> 01:23:58,028
revised that needs some work like important
work so

385
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:21,593
what are you aware of any other solutions
that are not black chain-related I'm just
curious you know how I feel about crypto but
this is this is a good example of blockchain
technology that could be used for something
besides Krypto and some reason I believe we
still need to allow in on blockchain
Research to happen because there's many
other possibilities here soon

386
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:30,274
you have been thinking of you guys in school

387
01:24:33,549 --> 01:24:34,652
Pensacola

388
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:42,326
connect me with some stuff together on the
internet

389
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,949
so

390
01:24:48,073 --> 01:25:11,991
oh

391
01:25:19,568 --> 01:25:40,126
yeah

392
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:50,581
yeah I know yeah yeah

393
01:25:50,581 --> 01:25:55,778
I was just going to say the problem you
talked about is

394
01:25:56,825 --> 01:26:11,952
I think what you're saying is that it's much
bigger than just DNS and this I think
carries into the conversation about zero
trust architecture a little bit because

395
01:26:12,169 --> 01:26:18,089
you can't really trust anything how can you
trust any device right

396
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:20,371
and

397
01:26:20,621 --> 01:26:32,496
yeah the only got ya they found those back
towards they found the back doors in the GPS
as well that were bad and supply-chain
problems in China and they were getting
modified before they were shipping

398
01:26:33,057 --> 01:26:37,236
so yeah yeah

399
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:46,494
now

400
01:26:56,443 --> 01:27:02,358
she has some kind of History

401
01:27:03,154 --> 01:27:07,909
oh that's a good point

402
01:27:13,077 --> 01:27:23,972
I want to capitalize on that idea for a
second so

403
01:27:24,398 --> 01:27:28,747
you said something that I think is really
important so

404
01:27:29,268 --> 01:28:21,992
and I'm just been dabbling in in not
blockchain but the idea of zero trust and
from what I understand about zero trust and
boils down to giving everything and a
verifiable identity usually through some
sort of cryptography but what you're
suggesting the blockchain offers is another
layer of that which is super interesting and
that is not just verifying identity but
providing a history for that identity and
that makes it so Amy just knowing something
came from who you said it was his one
problem but knowing that you can trust that
unique identity is a different question and
you can't really make that decision

405
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:48,599
yeah I mean as many difficulties in making
that decision right you have that you can
create a ring of trust like hey at least 10
other people also trust is so I'm going to
trust it but something that could contribute
to that even if it adds overhead would be
but let's look at the history of this thing
and let's decide if we can trust it all by
yourself and and that's something by Shane
doesn't bring to the table so because I mean

406
01:28:48,600 --> 01:29:00,031
yeah I I just every time we talk about
watching it always I always get hung up on
the finite nature of the chain itself

407
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:16,398
no

408
01:29:21,782 --> 01:29:50,124
get down yeah yeah

409
01:29:50,824 --> 01:30:05,126
documents

410
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:53,336
yeah my friend my friend who does
presentations on this that that's the single
biggest compelling part of all of it to me
and then he calls it self Sovereign identity
and identity is the idea that that you own
your identity whether it be medical records
or you know business information or visit
the building blocks of zero trust
architecture you know it's it it stands on
its own you're right and that that I think I
want to believe in that but I I sometimes
feel like I don't know I feel like it's just
too perfect

411
01:30:54,910 --> 01:31:16,911
I was just going to keep up with the work
it's not right

412
01:31:18,897 --> 01:31:34,457
the problem is because they use because the
the way that smart contracts

413
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:42,912
all right yeah yeah

414
01:31:44,013 --> 01:31:45,006
yeah

415
01:31:45,303 --> 01:31:56,171
yeah and I am wanted to I wanted so hard to
like ethereum in distributed apps and then I
saw how permanent the contracts were and
that was hard

416
01:31:56,369 --> 01:31:59,837
but yeah I mean

417
01:32:06,556 --> 01:32:13,853
industry is filled with the idea gets which
yeah

418
01:32:17,735 --> 01:32:29,610
it'll make things very fast it doesn't he
must watch this channel you know that I
talked to him about that all the time yeah
all right

419
01:32:30,063 --> 01:32:43,812
what's up right now

420
01:32:49,046 --> 01:32:50,106
yeah

421
01:32:54,975 --> 01:33:01,940
are we this is a this is there's actually a
guy who gave a presentation on this and he

422
01:33:02,379 --> 01:33:38,430
did you use an American reference he did a
War of the Worlds scenario where what if
Google went down and he painted a picture is
a fictional picture of the like there's like
I think six people at Google wear if if if
more than half of them were unavailable the
whole world would stop Gmail I go at cuz cuz
things will go down you know and yeah so I
think you're making a point about
centralization bad

423
01:33:46,071 --> 01:33:53,454
yeah hey Ya

424
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:07,279
so this problem.

425
01:34:07,967 --> 01:34:10,461
Yeah yeah yeah

426
01:34:13,389 --> 01:34:17,672
just people rely on as an identity as a
money

427
01:34:22,046 --> 01:34:27,907
if it went down yeah yeah

428
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,866
no

429
01:34:34,238 --> 01:35:16,351
beat correct yes yeah I know I think that's
the darphin it was in the military angle
they said make a network that will survive a
nuclear bomb and therefore DNS is
distributed that's another problem with the
NS by the way Federation yeah DNS has been
so screwed up because everybody uses Cloud
fair for their DNS and it went down in the
whole half the internet went down and I
don't know why we're not learning this this
I don't know I don't know why we're not
picking up on this and doing something
better you know thinking about it

430
01:35:17,832 --> 01:35:19,069
him

431
01:35:37,646 --> 01:35:39,166
yeah

432
01:36:01,452 --> 01:36:11,661
yeah

433
01:36:32,452 --> 01:36:39,670
Pax Rich's right

434
01:36:46,919 --> 01:36:59,794
the function I'm sorry functional
programming

435
01:37:01,324 --> 01:37:03,826
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

436
01:37:19,652 --> 01:37:39,638
transaction outfits or which one are you
talking about

437
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:41,366
isn't

438
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:51,584
okay yeah I didn't

439
01:37:52,804 --> 01:38:18,616
I don't think I realized that difference
between the two so wait let me restate this
so you're saying that Bitcoin partially
succeeded because it had an unlimited scope
you know it wasn't limited and then admitted
but that if they're e m got limited because
I had a global and try to have a global
state is that right is right and interesting
yeah

440
01:38:19,089 --> 01:38:24,271
yeah I don't I think it was a cash yeah

441
01:38:26,202 --> 01:38:27,762
you're going to look at

442
01:38:28,977 --> 01:38:58,598
if you're trying to split them and you can
take them to a one or two catches and give
them to a Smart contract it can take the
other caches and give them to 1%

443
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:06,884
to basically

444
01:39:07,121 --> 01:39:15,034
yeah well yeah I should probably look at
that again and go back to it and just give
it a fresh

445
01:39:23,099 --> 01:39:29,510
can different action has five types of body

446
01:39:31,387 --> 01:39:33,499
okay

447
01:39:35,396 --> 01:39:40,167
yeah

448
01:39:49,246 --> 01:40:07,284
from 1 to 1 minutes one and it can be can be
at this address

449
01:40:14,764 --> 01:40:19,038
which one are you describing I'm sorry which
one you just driving right now

450
01:40:23,956 --> 01:40:25,487
okay

451
01:40:37,195 --> 01:40:41,941
maybe it's a surface that emits for me

452
01:40:55,540 --> 01:41:12,398
become the bridge

453
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:49,656
because if you can make something that's why
I'm really you know I have two two things
that I I really want to follow with regard
to manipulate I like the the d-pad breakdown
of how it works it's super interesting I
feel like I need to get makes me want to get
back into a little bit but there's two
things virtual welcome Tony Faso tell me if
I was here so I spell persist in talking
about some some possible

454
01:41:49,711 --> 01:42:31,626
you know alternatives to DNS that depend on
blockchain technology to to allow you know
to remove the requirement to trust a single
CA in which inflates prices on DNS and all
that kind of thing and didn't come here to
the question just about boxing in general I
have I have their stuff three questions that
I still have with regard to crypto and I
think they're pretty mainstream questions
the first one is what is the impact of the
51% attack and the reality of it and there's
good and there's good you know educated
people who still feel like that

455
01:42:31,634 --> 01:42:57,724
undermines the entire mathematical approach
completely let alone how it's deployed in
the second what is the movement towards
proof of stake versus proof of work is so
that we can eliminate the impact on the
world for for a technology that's so
competition Ali intense

456
01:42:57,724 --> 01:43:07,245
and I know that is always kind of a third
thing I'm like why can't we just use gpg I
know what you could just got on the tations
because they're

457
01:43:07,499 --> 01:43:18,147
you know is there something else is the
three things that I had those kind of my
mind we talking about Frank Russian
government might be might ban Bitcoin mining
completely

458
01:43:18,523 --> 01:43:25,644
Oggi's how to get a band that I'm going to
try and attract all the transactions I guess
it would

459
01:43:26,422 --> 01:44:05,312
I'm anxious to know how if know if house
looking like I should prefer that you want
for some tacos accurate yeah I am a sentient
being is real and it is and if it's a thing
if it's a thing I'm not saying it is but I
believe it is because I trust the people
that I've asked you've done PhD
dissertations on this Brian Ford comes to
mind the guy who invented Peg and I I don't
know is if it if it is a thing and that
means it is possible for someone to gain
full control of the entire blockchain

460
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:36,279
it is possible under certain conditions at
the fact that it's even possible I I don't
want that to sound like Fudd you know I'm
not spreading fear just for the fear sake I
truly want to understand it because
otherwise it could be a very strong enough
solution to problems like DNS and other
stuff so my niece is attractive swallow a
pill it's like growing weed and and crypto
mining

461
01:44:37,129 --> 01:44:48,984
do you have a lot of you have a lot of Sun
lamps in your house or do you have a lot of
servers either way what if you have both I'm
growing weed and I'm doing crypto mining

462
01:44:50,144 --> 01:44:54,619
so they're still trust most watching over
Facebook server Farm yeah

463
01:44:54,620 --> 01:45:23,015
yeah you sure can I might have to walk away
for a second my wife is here but if you want
it if you want it hold on to the Miken and
answer questions for people I'm happy to let
you do that just be nice to people if you
want to join the conversation you can I'm
going to walk away from about 5 minutes so I
take a break but

464
01:45:23,017 --> 01:45:28,329
but yeah sure certainly you're certainly
welcome what's up

465
01:45:29,238 --> 01:45:33,093
I can still kind of hear you at least I
could

466
01:45:34,028 --> 01:45:40,461
needs a big players 1% big Wells Will
control most of the decisions and it work
yeah

467
01:45:43,239 --> 01:45:45,222
mobile

468
01:45:47,885 --> 01:45:52,371
I am going to take a break I'm just going to
step away

469
01:45:51,532 --> 01:46:13,460
step away for about 5-10 minutes so the
Discord is is up and you're welcome to
continue to answer questions from the chat
sounds like you know a lot about this topic
so if you would like to answer questions
from the chat while I'm away for 5 minutes
or so that be great so I'll head over to

470
01:46:15,014 --> 01:46:19,046
I don't know if they like it or not they're
going to do it anyway

471
01:46:19,587 --> 01:46:28,083
because it's great to have somebody who's
got the level of knowledge you have with us
and and I'll be back

472
02:02:36,143 --> 02:02:42,910
I'm back what I miss my my wife is

473
02:02:43,545 --> 02:02:48,227
my wife is buying a car so I'm trying to
help her

474
02:02:48,947 --> 02:02:55,754
Amazon wallets that's a good question hey
thanks for the gift Subs people

475
02:02:55,897 --> 02:02:57,947
old etherium classic anymore

476
02:03:20,583 --> 02:03:28,811
that wasn't like it's not anything like the
the Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash or something

477
02:03:34,514 --> 02:03:40,046
yeah oh God

478
02:03:57,670 --> 02:04:02,680
wow yeah

479
02:04:09,867 --> 02:04:11,863
now wow

480
02:04:22,343 --> 02:04:50,364
yeah yeah yeah there's actually a really
good documentary about this I think it's on
Amazon Prime I thought it was going to be
kind of one-sided and they kind of walk the
middle path I forget the name of it if
anybody remembers it actually takes you on
tour through the like these facilities in
New Zealand in the Netherlands and and
Iceland that are doing Bitcoin and stuff in
it you know was It was kind of an eye-opener
I talked about some of the good things you
can do until the bad

481
02:04:50,369 --> 02:04:55,502
but but yeah

482
02:05:00,443 --> 02:05:02,379
the questions I have

483
02:05:03,133 --> 02:06:03,665
yeah I have three by three of the three
questions that I have about any box and
Technology you know what the obvious ones
right the the power consumption and proof of
stake versus proof-of-work possibilities
going for the most substantial question I
have is is the math sound and sustainable
and I I feel like that the 51% attack has
been downplayed by the entire crypto world
without the blockchain the 51% attack is not
an issue for banks doing bank-to-bank
exchanges because they you know they they
control everything they can probably do
proof of stake and so using blockchain
technology in an isolated controlled
environment makes sense but when you start
to go out there in the whole point of black
Santa supposed to be zero trust

484
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:11,377
and if you you can't have zero trust if
there's a possibility that someone is going
to have 51% control

485
02:06:10,018 --> 02:06:33,279
51% control eventually and I I don't I'm a
I'm a novice and understanding all of us but
I've asked people and it so that's that's my
biggest my biggest concern is it that it's
at the actual math of the entire thing is is
it's founded on the hope that nobody will
ever have 51% control

486
02:06:34,301 --> 02:06:39,085
and that's that's the main one and

487
02:06:39,639 --> 02:06:47,091
I don't know if that's the way to talk about
it what's up coming here makes easy work

488
02:06:54,599 --> 02:07:01,434
do another question yeah go ahead and repeat

489
02:07:06,757 --> 02:07:08,070
alright

490
02:07:25,229 --> 02:07:28,097
yeah I guess

491
02:07:37,596 --> 02:07:45,550
what's up I'm not going to blow your mind

492
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:51,805
as engines

493
02:08:04,767 --> 02:08:10,746
all the users of the spine of books what's a
51% attack

494
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:30,083
now

495
02:08:37,265 --> 02:08:43,976
even keep going to because Europe

496
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:51,123
Mom I'm in the different rhyme

497
02:09:06,677 --> 02:09:07,990
right

498
02:09:19,392 --> 02:09:40,567
we will be able to do is just

499
02:09:42,199 --> 02:09:53,429
yeah they couldn't they they couldn't alter
transactions they could stop transactions
and they couldn't reverse transactions
either right

500
02:09:53,928 --> 02:10:04,939
yeah it's impossible to reverse a
transaction yeah it's not like if they get
51% I think that's the I'm glad you said
that because that's important people know

501
02:10:05,091 --> 02:10:16,640
if somebody could can get could get control
I'm in theoretically theoretically someone
could get control of the entire blockchain
but they could never steal

502
02:10:16,829 --> 02:10:32,034
from people that have already done whatever
the transaction is they couldn't steal that
nor could they they could just shut it down
right they could say hey we're not going to
let these other people participate in the
mining and

503
02:10:36,373 --> 02:10:43,467
yeah right so they would just make their own
and that yeah

504
02:10:46,906 --> 02:10:51,922
right and I what's at the Hatchery what's at
the Hatchery is what

505
02:10:53,867 --> 02:11:01,075
speed of conversations that Hatchery so and
then at the other the other big I'm sorry go
ahead

506
02:11:03,748 --> 02:11:11,375
yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

507
02:11:11,751 --> 02:11:36,537
yeah there's just I really think that we
need to consider keep practising as Society
in general needs to keep experimenting with
blockchain tech I really believe that I
don't want anybody to get the wrong
impression and I've. Talk to you about my
annoyance about people trying to save the
world with blockchain instead of spending
time doing other things that's more of a
social problem and not so much a tech
problem

508
02:11:36,542 --> 02:12:01,700
and but and it's been in there the energy
thing and you know I heard extra first time
I heard it was on go time is it Go Time
Podcast and add somebody on there and they
talked about I talk about proof of stake and
if we can do proof of stake and have it be
safe I'm not convinced proof of stake isn't
just a different form of CGA you know what
do you think of that

509
02:12:13,304 --> 02:12:14,523
right

510
02:12:20,116 --> 02:12:21,505
yeah

511
02:12:32,003 --> 02:12:35,686
yeah yeah that's true

512
02:12:35,890 --> 02:12:59,658
wow I hadn't even thought of that that is
that is a really good point maybe it is it's
really energy-intensive and people usually
talk about how that's bad for the
environment and stuff but I hadn't even
thought of it as being the point of failure
you pull a plug of the energy to a farm and
goodbye in us and governments do control
energy consumption

513
02:13:03,123 --> 02:13:04,914
yes

514
02:13:06,207 --> 02:13:23,892
well I think that's why people of Iceland so
much Iceland is so free as some of the
biggest farms I heard her in Iceland not for
the sun energy but because of the lack of
Regulation and the other I love of the
finance industry in general ever die so just
like

515
02:13:25,895 --> 02:13:29,779
what do you think about

516
02:13:29,779 --> 02:13:35,160
yeah

517
02:13:38,375 --> 02:13:40,122
yeah

518
02:13:42,092 --> 02:13:57,437
right and I forgot about geothermal in
Iceland that's a big deal that is a big deal
in general energy yeah South Dakota

519
02:14:19,529 --> 02:14:29,913
right

520
02:14:36,936 --> 02:14:38,777
right

521
02:14:40,412 --> 02:14:46,012
yeah

522
02:14:46,012 --> 02:14:54,474
but I don't want my only problem with proof
of stake as I understand it is I know it's a
different technology but

523
02:14:54,475 --> 02:15:13,277
it would be getting the buy-in on the ring a
trust kind of idea you no proof of stake
doesn't work unless a group of minnow
participants agree that these people matter
more than other people are already know that
mean I'm paraphrasing but

524
02:15:23,454 --> 02:15:25,504
rap

525
02:15:31,828 --> 02:15:37,469
sphere volume yeah

526
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:50,438
first of all do not give it to any job give
it to any tricks easy right

527
02:16:08,626 --> 02:16:11,929
yeah

528
02:16:20,463 --> 02:16:38,598
right now

529
02:16:56,091 --> 02:17:04,886
yeah yeah I can see a lot of a lot of ways
that would be okay

530
02:17:15,553 --> 02:17:21,422
now

531
02:17:29,497 --> 02:17:36,564
no not really no not in this says snow now
you don't care no

532
02:17:44,051 --> 02:17:45,278
yeah

533
02:17:59,548 --> 02:18:00,744
yeah

534
02:18:22,821 --> 02:18:27,113
you can

535
02:18:28,916 --> 02:18:45,812
yeah I have to play Devil's Advocate though
because I

536
02:18:46,716 --> 02:18:49,806
I mean proof of stake to me

537
02:18:50,529 --> 02:18:56,280
kind of rolls back one of the main
advantages of blockchain

538
02:18:56,379 --> 02:19:02,509
which is you know absolute decentralisation
and

539
02:19:03,962 --> 02:19:33,774
while I think proof-of-stake still
distributes the authority to more people in
ass people talk about academics or however
you want to do it or like you say with your
competitors with multiple networks even
though it it opens the doors for 4:40
centralization it's still to some degree
centralized and then you have to ask
yourself is all of this technology necessary

540
02:19:33,775 --> 02:19:48,245
or could we just look at another way of
decentralized thing you see anything cuz as
soon as you start rolling back the I think
is the primary argument for blockchain which
is decentralisation

541
02:19:50,333 --> 02:19:59,934
then you know it's it's i h developer you
know I feel like you know is it still worth
all the

542
02:20:06,077 --> 02:20:07,419
yeah

543
02:20:13,785 --> 02:20:46,884
is that

544
02:20:48,871 --> 02:20:51,228
I'm going to help provide

545
02:21:01,203 --> 02:21:02,107
help them

546
02:21:14,965 --> 02:21:24,017
helps poor people like that

547
02:21:27,872 --> 02:21:29,870
interesting

548
02:21:44,581 --> 02:21:53,561
oh wow that that I don't think I realize
that that steak is transferable obviously
because it's just an identity at the end of
the day

549
02:21:55,318 --> 02:21:56,392
yeah

550
02:22:04,148 --> 02:22:09,310
it makes you wonder though if that if
there's like a shadow Market

551
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:16,399
that would emerge to sell steak you like

552
02:22:16,605 --> 02:22:21,137
if it couldn't happen I mean could it happen
I mean

553
02:22:29,103 --> 02:22:30,396
oh okay

554
02:22:41,199 --> 02:22:49,173
oh I see I see what you're saying

555
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:50,718
I see

556
02:22:53,476 --> 02:23:53,980
so you're saying you're saying that the
participants in the chain itself can choose
to say so basically Blacklist certain steak
and to go now we're not doing it and that's
interesting because I think it with that who
it was that we said the whole box anything
assigned for a second and I want to talk a
little bit about how I've been trying to
establish knowledge trust you know on their
knowledge exchange grid it boils down to Oki
and it's a whole circle of trust thing but
that includes blackballing people are
blacklisting people it's like I I trust you
so I want to hear everything you have to say
and I want to hear who you trust to get
information from and I also want to hear who
you don't trust to get information from and
so on and so on and you you build a
community ring of trust that I would really
like to see happen in terms of just
Knowledge Management I want to see
everything then.

557
02:23:53,988 --> 02:24:00,449
If I says I know and I don't want to see
anything that so-and-so says so

558
02:24:00,449 --> 02:24:09,789
if those principles are applied to the
blockchain and proof of stake and it sounds
like they are then I think it's based on
solid principles even if

559
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:16,553
another lot lot of that stuff is yet to be
yeah

560
02:24:33,123 --> 02:24:50,528
absolutely and I'm all about finding ways to
do that and and that's another reason I just
want to say another reason that I'm even
talking about blockchain and stuff like that
is because

561
02:24:50,037 --> 02:25:08,429
because something in this conversation is
going to fix the centralization problem in
our world today it's going to fix it and
there's I believe strongly that I don't know
that we're there yet but I something that's
coming out of this science

562
02:25:08,504 --> 02:25:11,878
it's going to fix that and it's going to be
big

563
02:25:15,447 --> 02:25:17,188
no it hasn't

564
02:25:24,303 --> 02:25:29,355
yeah yep

565
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:34,659
yeah right

566
02:25:49,156 --> 02:25:55,258
yeah

567
02:25:55,811 --> 02:26:20,142
yeah yeah I mean there's we've tried this
before I just soon as I feel like some of
the other distributed decentralisation
Technologies are not being like you just
stay just like basic Pierce or a to Pyramid
now working without you know the need for
the blockchain I sometimes wonder if that
some of those Technologies could be

568
02:26:20,143 --> 02:27:09,472
I mean if you were if you if you eliminate
the need to have to trust everything so why
can't we just focus on like things on this
is like really naive idea but the
cypherpunks were all about encrypting
content and and then you know you just
distributed content however you want it you
didn't care about the method of Transport or
decentralisation the content was guaranteed
to be signed and athletic aided by a
particular key and if a key was validated
you could you know if he was bad you could
you could never just sitting there was a
central place to put keys but it could be
anywhere and then the owner of the key cuz I
hate this Keys been retracted or whatever so
anyway what is Frank saying the defensive
approach

569
02:27:09,927 --> 02:27:13,418
for your sake has attack vectors according
to PDF

570
02:27:14,454 --> 02:27:21,873
if the following barriers to longest chain
proof of State protocols that's interesting
paper

571
02:27:22,948 --> 02:27:28,450
did you see this one that sounds

572
02:27:29,779 --> 02:27:35,697
well what is cryptocurrency

573
02:27:42,633 --> 02:27:50,274
yeah if you want any links to anybody wants
to put in the chat and some people can do
their own research on this

574
02:27:50,275 --> 02:27:58,093
alright I've actually heard about this when
I pretty sure I'm pretty sure I've heard
about this one

575
02:28:10,689 --> 02:28:13,470
sure

576
02:28:36,094 --> 02:28:39,516
what will happen to these people

577
02:28:40,414 --> 02:28:46,540
and they are very valuable people can just
exist yeah

578
02:29:00,474 --> 02:29:03,144
leaders of the world

579
02:29:07,932 --> 02:29:14,328
become comfortable with our technology so
that we can help you in all these things

580
02:29:34,451 --> 02:29:42,690
and those two things on it and you can put
it into the other two

581
02:29:48,990 --> 02:29:50,878
a romantic country

582
02:30:11,831 --> 02:30:46,082
controversial things to tend to exert of
preserved forever yeah they're going to be
there and then I can send to the zero trust
me we have done if I here again we were
talking about earlier about zero trust and
how I mean that we weren't specifically
saying about how blockchain could be used to
deploy as reference architectures but I'm
interested to see what technology comes out
of the zero trust architecture movement that

583
02:30:46,561 --> 02:30:56,052
could be used alternatively 4D
centralization in place of blockchain or in
tandem with blockchain

584
02:31:02,454 --> 02:31:22,799
have to wind it once the book is generated
it has to be it has to be sent to the hole
Miss World like to like 95% of the network
in under five seconds

585
02:31:27,599 --> 02:31:35,397
the security assumptions and that's very
critical by the way but

586
02:31:40,653 --> 02:31:53,924
establish a single point of Truth and he can
take any amount of operators from this
protocol and establish your own size

587
02:31:54,903 --> 02:31:56,301
LOL

588
02:32:00,912 --> 02:32:06,432
yeah wow yeah that's it is

589
02:32:06,811 --> 02:32:28,180
it is this it is and that's it does it just
blows my mind how how efficient all of this
stuff is you know even if it takes 30
minutes to buy a pizza with Bitcoin you know
brushing technology depending on how it
support can be done efficiently and the
proof of stake thing is proving that more

590
02:32:28,182 --> 02:32:32,964
I'm just excited to see what happens I a boy

591
02:32:39,957 --> 02:32:43,399
but when you think about the 4th generation

592
02:32:50,296 --> 02:32:52,077
yeah

593
02:33:01,643 --> 02:33:03,441
yeah

594
02:33:04,151 --> 02:33:11,618
yeah I mean is it is it allows people yeah
the practical

595
02:33:12,763 --> 02:33:14,522
right

596
02:33:15,297 --> 02:33:28,676
yeah I'm super excited by where it's going I
just the Practical you know guy cynic in me
remains this is like you know the old dude
in me it just

597
02:33:28,676 --> 02:33:49,073
the level of complexity we tried to do an
ethereum contract as this as a as a camp
once and the level of potential risk key
points of failure during the development
process this is if there is some kind of
picking on the whole thing it's not fair to
pick on the whole thing just because of the
ethereum contract

598
02:33:49,074 --> 02:34:11,382
but I bet it it makes a larger point and the
larger point is the layers of complexity
that this has everything and then isn't
Justified so in the 1990s we live in a world
where nothing was encrypted tell that fdp
mail everything travel over the wire and
absolute clear text and things were simpler
in it and if if we go back to that

599
02:34:10,128 --> 02:35:10,556
go back to that time of a simpler time right
and also like a fucking crazy insecure time
too and it was no chance of ever getting you
know people are doing credit card
transactions in the clear over the over the
internet at the time and then and then what
and then we have you know the old school
days of like one server multiple users you
know NFS and then I asked and then came
virtualization and things got more
complicated and then came containerization
and things got more Camp complicated but as
soon as you start to imagine a world where
we're combining containerization with no
orchestration like everybody's and things
like that with watching Tech you're starting
to reach a level of complexity that a guy
like me has to ask why you know why are we
we doing this are there are there are
simpler ways of going about this and I'm I'm
not attacking it I think it needs to be
dealt with and we need to explore it just
like

600
02:35:10,751 --> 02:35:53,558
kubernetes to be dealt with. I'm still not
100% convinced that the jury is completely
you know decided that Cooper Nettie's is
going to be the way to go for the whole
future I think it's probably about 80% or
90% I go for that but I've seen Technologies
coming fail and come and go and come and go
in and obviously blockchain Tech is not
going anywhere there's so much money
invested it at this point I like Peach p b
there is an entire economy surrounding it so
it's going to be with us forever but it is
it is it the best thing for us is it going
to be a minute if we're going to add

601
02:35:53,564 --> 02:35:57,759
yeah it's Emily different I think the bottom
line is

602
02:35:58,297 --> 02:36:07,328
are the benefits going to outweigh the
negatives and Anna and that's a really basic
thing to say but

603
02:36:07,385 --> 02:36:08,725
yeah

604
02:36:11,845 --> 02:36:17,905
yeah yeah

605
02:36:28,613 --> 02:36:34,401
if you right

606
02:36:37,407 --> 02:36:50,662
blockchain

607
02:37:01,471 --> 02:37:03,222
became possible

608
02:37:15,798 --> 02:37:21,243
if there's a trust going to be

609
02:37:23,047 --> 02:37:30,989
okay well V symbol yeah

610
02:37:32,112 --> 02:37:46,761
I know. That is why I see what you're saying
that that is definitely value it's very hard
to quantify that value though because you
know every scientific lie anyway it may be
absolutely right I mean is it going to be
going to be less

611
02:37:46,763 --> 02:38:34,566
you know that the technology is going to is
going to replace a bunch of other systems
that people use that same argument for the
web and they were right I remember a guy
named Don Tapscott predicting the removal of
the middle layers of society and economies
and now after Covetous hit I mean let's
let's be real it's all about bosses and
people working for bosses and the people in
the middle are largely eliminated even Banks
of centralized because so much of the
competition has been replaced by stuff that
can be provided in this you know the zero
opportunity cost sharing economy that were
in you know it's things like this I can come
to y'all directly right and the building so
the point being

612
02:38:34,569 --> 02:38:50,716
yes Technologies in the past have
fundamentally change the social fabric at
the economic level as well and they have
clearly Justified their costs was just stick
with webtech is as much as I complain about
how horrible the web is now

613
02:38:50,184 --> 02:39:05,118
what is now you know technology has paid for
itself I mean you can make the same argument
against the internet right so they give all
those extra server Farms right

614
02:39:06,909 --> 02:39:38,702
yeah yeah and so so I guess I'm agreeing is
that it is possible that it it is possible
that this technology will alter Society in a
way that pays for the technological
innovation as we have seen the internet do
the internet has clearly paid for itself you
know all of the money necessary to deploy
the internet as we know it today and believe
me I mean a trillions of trillions of
dollars to do it I think has easily been

615
02:39:38,725 --> 02:40:04,380
you know one back by the value it is
provided the whole world and so I think it's
safe to say that that bunting or
Technologies like it could could eventually
have a return on investment that is equal to
what the internet gave us it's just hard to
know that right now Steve Jobs had to go to
work what's up

616
02:40:04,555 --> 02:40:23,380
yeah you can certainly do I mean there's a
lot of people who can help us understand
it's like Steve Jobs trying to describe
describe two I kind of like listening to you
talk to me it's it's like Steve Job there's
a there's a video of him trying to explain
to the common person why you would ever want
to connect two computers together

617
02:40:23,635 --> 02:40:45,645
he's like no really if you connect two
computers you can have this in this and he
sounds just like a block chain person you
know he's like trying to sell sell the idea
that we understand the whole world will
change everything is going to pay for it so
why would I pay to connect my computer as
its insecure it's a bad thing it's going to
cost us more money all the same arguments
against blockchain

618
02:40:45,646 --> 02:40:51,061
we're against networking computers and look
where that went you know

619
02:40:57,025 --> 02:41:04,584
right

620
02:41:11,128 --> 02:41:12,168
help people

621
02:41:14,872 --> 02:41:35,572
even if you have the STI in the world

622
02:41:43,428 --> 02:41:48,724
oh right yes it was really fun

623
02:41:54,506 --> 02:42:01,652
yeah this true it would be great if we had a
better way yeah

624
02:42:09,767 --> 02:42:11,577
yes

625
02:42:14,670 --> 02:42:20,242
we do and I've had plenty of bad things make
it into my mind so yeah

626
02:42:25,394 --> 02:42:33,636
look at the social media

627
02:42:34,557 --> 02:42:40,786
but then clicks on what you're sharing is
better

628
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:46,669
right

629
02:42:51,339 --> 02:43:00,088
the husband actually has two cases Facebook
for example must was arguing think or that's
ridiculous

630
02:43:04,714 --> 02:43:12,676
Facebook login

631
02:43:14,814 --> 02:43:18,879
we don't need fact checkers

632
02:43:36,411 --> 02:43:38,142
Snopes yeah

633
02:43:39,423 --> 02:43:44,941
but that my my my stepson was just telling
me that about the Flat Earth people

634
02:43:45,281 --> 02:44:06,022
and they they were there you cannot convince
them and I don't want to die over to into
that but you just cannot convince them of
the fax is there that's physically they just
will not accept it under any circumstance so
yeah people are going to make their own
reality but Sciences

635
02:44:06,098 --> 02:44:11,106
always been the best and we need to protect
ourselves from that until I guess your point
is

636
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:19,899
something like a blockchain could protect us
from our own wrong conclusions that might be
based on

637
02:44:20,034 --> 02:44:25,208
false false intuition things like that yeah

638
02:44:34,283 --> 02:44:58,869
fuchsia

639
02:44:59,385 --> 02:45:05,554
I would love to have an option what I can
share with

640
02:45:08,497 --> 02:45:15,917
or anyone who's Express in the field can you
please help me verify this

641
02:45:48,309 --> 02:45:54,527
huh wow

642
02:46:12,410 --> 02:46:13,815
yeah

643
02:46:17,615 --> 02:46:23,977
and you can see a completely different about
one topic and can

644
02:46:25,559 --> 02:47:07,306
yeah I can't wait to yeah I would prefer
that I yeah I mean I'm all about creating
Circles of people that I trust and picking
the people that I trust and I realize
there's a danger they're creating an echo
chamber of people that only tell you what
you believe I mean that's that's you know
what others have suggested as you have
gotten us into this problem in the past is
now being able to check our own intuition

645
02:47:07,309 --> 02:47:11,103
but yeah those are those are crazy topics
really fun topics aren't they

646
02:47:13,401 --> 02:47:16,148
I need a Dutch coin Echo chamber

647
02:47:23,519 --> 02:47:30,072
Bible say everyone Frank I think yes Frank I
think you mean a Taurus

648
02:47:33,089 --> 02:47:37,622
I sorry I had to put that in there they're
talkin about flat earthers now

649
02:47:38,174 --> 02:47:45,568
is the island where the tourist was in
Second Life cuz it was like one of the
friends that you can do for modeling

650
02:47:46,679 --> 02:48:11,515
I was just before I interact with but I'm
not opposed to disagree with each other I
think I think having control of your sources
of input is a fundamental human right eye I
believe that wholeheartedly and I thought I
believe that there's a lot of these searches
are violating that by taking that away from
us and guessing what we want and I think we
should be able to control our search

651
02:48:09,942 --> 02:48:20,547
the control our search engine optimization
ourselves we should be able to say this is
what I want to search for this is what I
want you to show me and they refuse to do
that so

652
02:48:23,738 --> 02:48:26,212
basically make this a green

653
02:48:33,993 --> 02:49:13,400
no no I can't I agree that's why we need
something more and that that leads into what
I loved it in my favorite topic that I don't
do anything with which is the whole you no
idea of exchanging like what time you want
us using 24 hours using a metal casting now
on and I'm able to read those thoughts
directly it's much more than just a block
Network by the way it's it's it's being able
to see people don't think about things in
real time and what are they how are they
digesting you know their thoughts is that if
they choose to publish them let me know the
people that want to do that but but yeah but
it wasn't very I haven't played in a long
time have any other questions from the from
the peanut gallery

654
02:49:13,407 --> 02:49:23,847
it's been a sufficient time since I drink my
coffee to require that I take another break
for reasons that I shall not say but I I
think

655
02:49:24,322 --> 02:49:36,083
but this is been a phenomenal conversation
developer II still alright I appreciate it
so much it's it's you know it says

656
02:49:38,260 --> 02:50:11,251
yeah I mean it's I like being able to play
around with these ideas and you know how
people in an attack our own biases and stuff
like that one video we need to get that box
chain really end tables and a new human
interactions the history of get get him in
coinbase interesting to consider it
absolutely and and that's you know I don't I
don't I don't I don't know either I mean.
You're my Still Remains you know reasonably
skeptical of

657
02:50:11,256 --> 02:51:11,764
an excruciatingly large amount of technology
to accomplish things that might be
accomplished with a better phone system you
know or or is it my criticism of the crypt
the world in general is that they they keep
siding you know World change in the
illumination of poverty in the New World
Order and all this and they don't look at
other simpler methods to accomplish those
goals microloans and we should also print
off work and everything like that so I don't
want to say we don't need no stinking
internet who needs an internet we don't need
our computers connected together there's no
reason that we should ever have that mean
that could have been somebody in the 1980s
saying the same thing I don't want to be
that guy I want to allow the exploration
even if I don't understand its value
directly yet and and that I have continued
to try to understand that value and having
having somebody like you know

658
02:51:11,769 --> 02:51:38,306
eyedropper here are my other friend who is
he and I had extensive talks about this is
that we hear it out and believe it or not I
do believe that about rust to I still want
to hear them out I'm going to laugh at them
every time you make a mistake but but I
think that we need to hear out new
technologies and allow them to the professor
something Xavier nipped in the bud and just
destroyed immediately like like what
documentation they require JavaScript

659
02:51:38,309 --> 02:51:51,353
but this is really great to have this
conversation I'm going to go ahead and step
away again again I just want to thank you
for the offer for all of that

660
02:51:52,526 --> 02:52:49,002
I'm I'm actually going to move on to a
different topic here and I'm probably going
to if somebody has a new question I want to
be able to allow other people to come in and
call it does anybody else he wants to call
in I'll still be here I'm going to be
turning back to the some of the Knowledge
Management stuff for the beginner boost but
I find this extremely fascinating stuff I'm
really got to talk about and today is the
day to do it Sunday is the day where we just
shoot the shed and drink coffee or beer or
whatever and just talk about these things so
if you have a topic that you would just
really like to really flush out verbally
which we don't always have a chance to do
here please please stop by the Discord and
get on stage and raise your hand and any
topic goes really any topic goes so I
appreciate having a sit over here anyway to
shift gears right now and walk away for a
bit in the meantime and I'll put a little
bit of music back on. We'll talk to you B

661
02:52:49,013 --> 02:52:56,860
bye-byealright so let's go back to

662
02:53:17,130 --> 02:53:24,356
all right so I'm going to take a quick just
another 10 minutes or so I'll be right back
maybe DOTA tonight yeah

663
02:53:24,715 --> 02:53:27,359
maybe it's it is Sunday after all

664
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:33,022
what you want to do a little bit more

665
02:53:34,075 --> 02:53:39,762
on this demesne modeling stuff that's really
boring and if people don't like it but I
know I need to work on it and I got here

666
02:53:40,505 --> 02:53:42,190
psoas stretch

667
03:04:04,368 --> 03:04:09,926
like I can be drinking coffee all day and
still still be cold I turn the music back on

668
03:04:13,124 --> 03:04:20,729
again thanks to all the people who
participated today in the conversations

669
03:04:21,665 --> 03:04:27,629
I love conversations on Sunday I think it's
one of the best things that

670
03:04:30,026 --> 03:04:37,486
that which offers us name some reduction
idea

671
03:04:40,354 --> 03:04:47,457
I'm trying to run a local handshake doesn't
work I already have small guided how to use
handshake me a network that's super cool

672
03:04:47,676 --> 03:04:53,891
Frank what's the traffic on Archer Private
Industry contracts yes

673
03:04:59,491 --> 03:05:05,733
when the government is allows reggae for him
every communication has consequences yes oh
boy yes

674
03:05:06,899 --> 03:05:08,834
oh boy yes

675
03:05:13,450 --> 03:05:23,320
question is do I have enough I feel like I
got enough of these things the reason I'm
going through all this documentation is

676
03:05:24,028 --> 03:05:27,997
I want to figure out where things go

677
03:05:36,662 --> 03:05:43,468
CI I'm going to try samples Kilauea ml

678
03:05:45,368 --> 03:05:47,719
so the eunuch is a boost

679
03:05:52,267 --> 03:05:54,934
skills. Why haven't you come home

680
03:05:59,074 --> 03:06:01,707
but you have a chief or title

681
03:06:15,661 --> 03:06:18,996
set up an FS is a skill

682
03:06:20,013 --> 03:06:24,038
how it was going to write it as if it would
be written in a job description

683
03:07:03,795 --> 03:07:07,575
oh yeah, soon as I heard the sirens the
names fight

684
03:07:12,165 --> 03:07:14,820
ax4n FS

685
03:07:19,516 --> 03:07:25,255
directories next next

686
03:07:33,475 --> 03:07:39,870
Maranatha storage on Linux oh God

687
03:07:48,702 --> 03:07:50,794
that's fucking weird

688
03:08:03,075 --> 03:08:10,918
terrifying yeah

689
03:08:38,066 --> 03:08:40,402
XSport in FS storage

690
03:08:46,828 --> 03:08:52,700
yeah I'm part about this is it's almost
impossible to distinguish between

691
03:08:53,838 --> 03:09:02,877
ask Elena task because the parameters for
amateur ization if you just say set up in a
fast that's like really fucking broad right

692
03:09:11,757 --> 03:09:19,223
so he says set up an FS and there's like X1
at the storage on Linux

693
03:09:23,154 --> 03:09:30,356
that's the part I'm afraid of this is the
part that makes me just like you just want
to run screaming and go to if I do too
because this is too much stuff

694
03:09:31,122 --> 03:09:33,930
a series practices internet more than one
egg

695
03:09:41,828 --> 03:09:59,624
I'm trying to come up with I'm just using
the recent project as a as a an example but
I'm trying to come up with job descriptions
suitable titles for skills that would have
been covered by

696
03:09:59,731 --> 03:10:02,200
by that you know

697
03:10:08,105 --> 03:10:09,535
so

698
03:10:22,225 --> 03:10:29,915
sorry honey I know I'm not talking about
titles and talking about it doesn't matter
so

699
03:10:30,406 --> 03:10:36,660
the lab manifest fragrant lab right so
what's this song

700
03:10:36,661 --> 03:10:43,001
What is one of the skills install and
configure vagrants

701
03:10:44,203 --> 03:10:46,051
would be a skill

702
03:10:50,445 --> 03:10:57,638
I already we do this do we say vagrant
install and configure vagrant create a
recipe vagrant create a thing you know what
I mean

703
03:11:05,191 --> 03:11:19,427
and it's almost like there is some
categorization of skills Based On Tools
automatically but but those things are also
methods of implementation so setting up nfsu
know or practice and if a store

704
03:11:21,913 --> 03:11:28,566
I'm just keep it to the topic at hand you
know I think you need to have vagrant

705
03:11:30,283 --> 03:11:35,908
when you got different applications being
referred right so

706
03:11:37,329 --> 03:11:40,755
vagrant install and configure right

707
03:11:42,468 --> 03:11:46,366
they her install vagrant install and
configure right

708
03:11:50,549 --> 03:11:55,883
I mean if we're going to keep these this
line items then we kind of have to include
the

709
03:12:00,164 --> 03:12:00,396
you know

710
03:12:08,884 --> 03:12:25,384
I give you something like creation and
management of benefits and limitations yeah
his vagrant is is one of the ways that we
did and if s implementation but it's not the
only way to test it out right so

711
03:12:27,189 --> 03:12:32,609
create and manage in FS

712
03:12:38,664 --> 03:12:40,746
direct and Storage

713
03:12:47,672 --> 03:12:50,680
I mean it is a very broad skills right

714
03:12:54,295 --> 03:13:06,716
yeah

715
03:13:08,043 --> 03:13:12,014
mercy me a lot of skills are things like
networking visualization in a festive Sandra

716
03:13:12,156 --> 03:13:18,835
yeah I know that's what I'm trying to say
this is this is this is the struggle when
dealing with skills

717
03:13:19,004 --> 03:13:38,101
it's also the reason that nobody does this
because the amount of skills to do a thing
is implicitly so overwhelming when you start
to write it down it's very over it gets very
overwhelming it's overwhelming for the
people writing it down I just met before the
other people tracking it will probably start
with

718
03:13:40,568 --> 03:13:46,613
yam a different way for you from people
that's for sure to you

719
03:13:49,348 --> 03:13:57,240
yeah yeah

720
03:14:00,186 --> 03:14:01,708
so

721
03:14:02,992 --> 03:14:11,846
meet creating and managing if a story is
obviously a parent skill that has a lot of
things that go under it

722
03:14:13,195 --> 03:14:19,133
the concepts before each step of the Boost
yeah I know that's that's actually what
boost is

723
03:14:19,711 --> 03:14:35,925
braids said the Boost is meant to be that as
to give you a really like barebones overview
of the of the idea behind it and then just
give you a taste of it so you can go off and
do your own thing but there is some
hand-holding there I mean you know

724
03:14:38,198 --> 03:14:41,492
we should start with with project run
absolutely

725
03:14:43,415 --> 03:15:20,045
yeah there's one doing the NFL has recently
on my mind I'm just trying to figure out as
soon as I'm so this is the only way that I'm
ever going to document anything is if I when
I go to create a lot when I go to do some
exploration of my own if I build into the
process taking notes on it which is already
overhead which I'm okay with and writing
down the skills that I'm developing as I do
them in terms that are familiar to me and
then we can come back and we can we can say
okay this is you know this is what you're
doing here

726
03:15:20,052 --> 03:15:59,122
and I if I can get that to become something
of a book of a common practice we can get
other people to do the same thing and
collaboratively we can end up documenting
the shit out of millions of skills Millions
literally there will be so many skills
listed individually that we can search for
them and then associate them that's the hard
part is going to be with this is it is to
get coming ality across the board for skills
to certain people skills are going to be are
going to match another there does need to be
your unique identifier for a skill at some
point and it can't be the title you know

727
03:15:59,595 --> 03:16:20,467
and how would that's what I'm doing this for
a while cuz I'm trying to figure out how do
we write it down and I'm just doing it in
Seattle right now but they're there is the
notion of all the same challenges that we
had in the saddle cast didn't apply to
skills there just in a different way where I
can make a separate people for everyone
right

728
03:16:21,382 --> 03:16:28,278
and yeah I know

729
03:16:35,053 --> 03:16:41,346
I can this is really messy but I I can make
a set for each skill

730
03:16:41,367 --> 03:16:46,455
Hulett tattoo I already I already have been
doing that

731
03:16:49,640 --> 03:17:01,802
I already have been doing that at how's it
going just be so every time every time I
like make a little note about how to do
something I document that thing as a zet

732
03:17:06,080 --> 03:17:12,679
this is a skill you sex wearing a festival
today in FSX sports that's a skill

733
03:17:13,656 --> 03:17:19,311
use entity what I'm trying to say is I think
I might already have the structure for all
this

734
03:17:20,156 --> 03:17:27,936
I just billed zet into Universal AFK tool
yeah I think I might need you to

735
03:17:31,438 --> 03:17:35,116
I think I might need to resend What if I

736
03:17:35,774 --> 03:17:52,224
if I say use in a fist to export value now I
have a unique identifier for the skill as
well because it's it's already uniquely
identified within the scope of all the
skills that I've listed and now I can go
find them and now the only thing we need to
do is is tagit

737
03:17:52,507 --> 03:17:59,767
we see the tag shit I I know this is sloppy
but this does the job

738
03:18:00,646 --> 03:18:03,658
tags skill

739
03:18:07,451 --> 03:18:10,344
plant plan simple lot we agree

740
03:18:18,837 --> 03:18:25,343
so yeah is exported validate in a physical

741
03:18:25,774 --> 03:18:31,101
and this time I think I think I think we're
onto something here

742
03:18:31,580 --> 03:18:42,022
because now we have a universal place to put
all the stuff and if we want to make another
thing then we just say hey this other skill
over here is related to it

743
03:18:43,108 --> 03:19:00,243
how to teach things actions and not so much
of academic talk yeah programmatically you
know practically a practical application for
my official committee are you going to going
to be beautiful I don't know anything that's
going to take time

744
03:19:00,397 --> 03:19:04,406
I'm not going to do cell

745
03:19:07,142 --> 03:19:16,958
yeah I thought it making it a non-profit I
definitely want to do that at some point if
if we can get that organized that would be
fantastic

746
03:19:17,341 --> 03:19:24,632
I'm right I'm trying to organize a
non-profit before it's a pain in the ass to
take straight crazy as a Time

747
03:19:24,795 --> 03:19:28,076
where do you see if it'd be a skill and
attached though

748
03:19:28,077 --> 03:20:18,100
that's kind of sad cookies that's that's
what I was touching on earlier that the
crossover between skills and task is really
annoying right because as soon as you put a
parameter on something like setting up NFS
right setting up NFS with XpertThief s is a
specific method implementation of how to set
up you know it's like a specific thing it
doesn't so you could argue that setting up
NFS and sewing configuring NFS is a specific
method of adding a storage class and see
what you get is to get this crossover
between tasks and skills where one
implementation with Brett and one for a
motorized thing which contain further
specificity is also a skill and attaching
same time and that gets fucking crazy
confusing really fast

749
03:20:18,307 --> 03:20:24,904
this is hardly the community you should so

750
03:20:27,643 --> 03:20:30,869
so so yeah

751
03:20:33,998 --> 03:20:37,850
I I don't know I don't know the answers are
people

752
03:20:40,834 --> 03:21:04,143
I honestly I don't know the answers I'm just
too busy buddy the one thing that I know
that has been working as down has been
working for a full year is dumping shit into
my zettelkasten that is help me to know and
you have no idea I've been able to go share
information with quickly and it will look it
up and able to have notes about how to do a
thing it's just a big notebook

753
03:21:04,146 --> 03:21:22,116
circus are we going to face of creation
management of any pesto be a skill that the
actual commands or should you soak your
hands would be a task and less of the only
thing you can do you know what I mean so
this is it this is where is that cookies
this is where I get I start to throw my
hands in the air

754
03:21:22,118 --> 03:21:26,717
yeah and and I feel like

755
03:21:27,523 --> 03:21:38,546
I feel like that's the greatest frustration
I have with we doing this every time I get
into it this is why I always drop it always
drop it because it's too much complexity to
organize it all

756
03:21:39,497 --> 03:21:48,660
yeah so trying to put this much structure
around something that's so fucking
monumentally Huges is really really hard

757
03:21:49,049 --> 03:22:04,783
S&K Logistics capability not the actual
implementation they can you yeah absolutely
yeah this is definitely the can you and the
implementation is that is whatever the task
right yeah that's that's that's what I wrote
earlier

758
03:22:08,201 --> 03:22:16,230
and yeah that the knowledge behind the
Tasker the ability you would ever capability
I like that word too

759
03:22:18,417 --> 03:22:45,351
then one guiding principle when it comes to
skills is how would you see it on a job
description to me that helps break down the
scope and a net I mean Selena sister on the
job description unless they're going to get
really you know like install and use export
FS you know to fix nfss never going to show
up in a job description that is a detail
about

760
03:22:45,354 --> 03:23:12,516
how to do the parents kill even though it is
also a skill knowing how to use export a
fast is is a skill right if you don't know
the arguments for it is a learning about
export fast and everything it does is a
skill you should read it you should read
them and Paige on it you should know all the
commands for it read all the arguments for
it so you can do it to do with particular
task using that specific tool and you know I
mean it gets it just gets crazy

761
03:23:13,653 --> 03:23:18,430
believe in me believe in the me that
believes in you

762
03:23:18,715 --> 03:23:28,688
I just goes my current job I always tell
them it still isn't just learning something
if you know a language backwards or forwards
is great but do you not know how to apply or
no just as hell yeah

763
03:23:28,691 --> 03:23:32,161
yeah the skill to me this kill is

764
03:23:32,335 --> 03:23:55,920
yeah I applied automatically applied
knowledge is just the theoretical
information and terms and definitions and
why the why and the skill is doing something
with the knowledge and it specifically the
task is doing something one time
specifically with a specifics a bit of skill
knowledge it's an execution of a skill

765
03:23:56,662 --> 03:24:00,776
yeah so

766
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:16,727
but you can't fight yeah right yeah I can do
it and I can execute on that but what am I
doing it for right with these parameters of

767
03:24:20,947 --> 03:24:29,197
I control the board yeah so so I remain

768
03:24:29,605 --> 03:24:36,284
frustrated by this I I continue to be
frustrated but all I want to do is

769
03:24:36,285 --> 03:24:40,739
know what to do when I do a lot when I
learned of that n f s

770
03:24:41,514 --> 03:25:03,501
you know what am I what am I doing what is
the process right well I think the process
is I create a Lobby that's public or private
where I go about exploring a bunch of stuff
and then I said about making several several
entries that match what I see as a skill at
the scope that I feel needs a full settle

771
03:25:03,504 --> 03:25:37,774
right and then I write as metal and in the
net that does that all describes how to do
the thing it contains it's my recipe
basically and that's my implementation of
that skill in the skills title is in the
name is the name of the metal and the unique
identifier for that skill is unique
identifier for that settle and then I can
tag it is a skill and I can pull all the
skills out of my total capstan by just
looking at them and if we stick with that

772
03:25:37,778 --> 03:25:50,968
that remains very personal enemy if that's a
question we'll how do you bubble that up
into something else right and I feel like

773
03:25:51,541 --> 03:25:58,216
we might be able to just use tagging and
zettelkasten in trees and say

774
03:25:58,216 --> 03:26:04,848
we could create tools that created index is
already have to create tools for indexing

775
03:26:03,328 --> 03:27:00,433
texting anyway unsettles based on tags so
that's already a part of that project that
project already has to has to do that right
there's already a project that has two index
module and divided as it does right but and
then what we can do but if you can say Okay
I want to create an index of all the skills
while then I just look for all the things
that are tagged with skill right and then I
can create a structured data file that
provides an index in to all of my skills and
I can make that itself is at all or an index
and index at or whatever you want to call it
and then I can go to that and see where all
my skills are and then ultimately we can
exchange those or my nose out or whatever
and and that becomes a part of the knowledge
exchange rate in the neck case and that case
Ace a skills list becomes another

776
03:27:00,441 --> 03:27:06,451
knowledge no data type do you remember that
remember when we used to talk about
knowledge and nodes

777
03:27:07,026 --> 03:27:12,257
so I know it you know data type one of the
knowledge nose type is a zettel

778
03:27:12,488 --> 03:27:27,258
at but if we if we create another knowledge
no data time this little casting format is a
knowledge note format is the same thing
that's why it's designed that way if we
should be in no time I think they should

779
03:27:27,261 --> 03:27:32,419
I think they should the problem is that all
the artifacts that would end up going in a
knowledge known

780
03:27:32,541 --> 03:27:43,576
and we talked about that too right and I
believe that's the decision to be made by
the people maintaining I do think I do think
aloud should be in no time and I'll let you
know.

781
03:27:43,987 --> 03:27:49,945
I think I think we need to revisit all I
think I think we need to revisit the whole
knowledge note ID again

782
03:27:49,946 --> 03:28:12,469
so the knowledge nothing predates
zettelkasten related sections your efforts
artifexian right and we've already we've
already completely structured knowledge
notes. And is that a casting that I as I've
implemented it is an implementation of

783
03:28:12,470 --> 03:29:04,848
a knowledge you know a parent no Department
knowledge note on the knowledge exchange
rate it's already that it's already attacked
and a zettel is just one type of knowledge
and now we can call it said oh I think it's
probably the best way to call it because
then that invoke see how everything that
goes with is that all she would be usually
no more than 25 lines and you know it has
some structural limitations but but then we
can start getting about the business of
establishing what did the knowledge and no
types are what are the types of knowledge
notes and we have Dynamic types which are
generated from other content and we you know
we have indexes and how lines or some like
that so I think we should come back to that
I think that does that does answer that work
yeah so so so that

784
03:29:04,853 --> 03:29:06,643
that could be

785
03:29:06,644 --> 03:29:14,750
that could be a part of that yeah it is just
so much stuff here and we still need to
write about

786
03:29:15,471 --> 03:29:22,186
yeah I think I'm glad you dated at Yellow by
the way

787
03:29:22,187 --> 03:29:28,355
I've been really really back and forth about
whether we should use Json or a mole

788
03:29:32,201 --> 03:29:36,948
I am I am still on the fence on that
particular point

789
03:29:36,949 --> 03:29:44,087
Yama was easier to maintain by hand hands
down but it's all so insecure and

790
03:29:44,087 --> 03:29:51,999
Jason doesn't allow you to write very well
and then we can have the thing where you can
do any one of them right

791
03:29:55,267 --> 03:30:02,888
everything is just an otologist source code
that can be managed to such knowledge bases
are just local root notes on keg

792
03:30:02,891 --> 03:30:09,498
definition of Jason oh well

793
03:30:10,316 --> 03:30:16,312
yeah we would shit I ain't even thought of
that

794
03:30:22,272 --> 03:30:27,948
yeah you can't you just we have to use a
mole

795
03:30:27,949 --> 03:30:37,066
and I think we should smell it why am I said
I want a mill I don't know why I did that
that's that's just it's more normal to do
then

796
03:30:37,521 --> 03:30:44,692
Jama at not not when you're copying pasting
yeah, does it have as many issues when you
copy and paste with you Emily

797
03:30:43,519 --> 03:30:51,085
in Pace with the mou can like push it over
and it just works Jason doesn't do that
Jason has to be

798
03:30:51,635 --> 03:30:58,687
they are very interchangeable with a hundred
percent compatible and it is an outliner

799
03:30:59,391 --> 03:31:06,528
compatible format yeah not sure about the
Reese's yes so

800
03:31:07,173 --> 03:31:43,482
so yeah I think we're going to stick with it
in a camel and the industry's pretty much
decided on you I will. Even if we have to
make a simplified version hey Ben if we if
we have to make a simplified version of yeah
I'm also be we make our own yellow parlor
and we we we disable the ability to nest and
all that stuff and we have Megan we have
taken to do that I wrote Megan so that we
can Define our own llamo the format yeah so
we can use Megan and say okay this is how
you defined its and then we will use them
picking it from the station of it and say
this is the day to definition of of camel

801
03:31:45,159 --> 03:31:48,003
python yeah little bit

802
03:31:52,174 --> 03:31:59,542
yeah we did that we did it because you want
to do our own person anyways so so I feel
like yeah

803
03:32:02,692 --> 03:32:04,918
I feel like that's the way to go

804
03:32:09,969 --> 03:32:15,250
I think at that point is still here just be
a type of zettel

805
03:32:16,721 --> 03:32:26,535
I don't know that we need to do data on
that. You know what I keep going back and
forth with is allowing certain things to be
documented in the markdown

806
03:32:27,670 --> 03:32:34,775
you know what I mean is the most universal I
believe I agree completely

807
03:32:35,154 --> 03:32:49,817
I did ask why I did Mark down for that kind
of thing a strong part of me that wants to
drop the the structure itself completely and
and stick with and stick with Mark down with
it has additional meeting

808
03:32:51,989 --> 03:32:55,328
because markdown is so easy to write

809
03:32:58,561 --> 03:33:00,362
so

810
03:33:03,871 --> 03:33:33,308
hey Mark. It's much harder to parse for that
kind of thing I originally I did that
originally they Central web didn't have a
separate thing right it would have at the
bottom of it it would have like a key value
per section it was bulleted you know I'd
have liked Properties or something like that
and I already and I have a thing called Tags
and if I have tags and there's just there's
just a section so so you can basically use

811
03:33:33,438 --> 03:33:43,004
you know you can use mark down and then have
all the stuff be in the markdown not there
are certain cases where that's very hard to
do

812
03:33:43,550 --> 03:34:29,228
hey if we're going to be able to have like
we're going to be able to use knowledge
notes as data types like extensive data
types where they provide you know pseudo
tables are replacing tables then we need to
provide like they denied me llamo or
something to that effect one of the cool
things about this was at one point I was
able to do this I was able to keg my get and
I had like you know like I don't know some.
Thing you know and it would actually go into
the ammo and get the exact property for that
so I could use my little Caston as a
database and I still want to support that
ability

813
03:34:29,234 --> 03:34:39,880
at some point but it did the problem with
that is that so let's say we're doing the
skill stuff right so is a skill and me take
one

814
03:34:41,620 --> 03:34:45,748
so we have this Earth say this is a skill
right

815
03:34:47,011 --> 03:34:54,607
all right so it's a skill I tagged it as a
skill it's a description of the skill how to
do it

816
03:34:55,752 --> 03:35:00,817
and that makes this turns to settle into a
skilled at a time

817
03:35:00,974 --> 03:35:12,767
and maybe still is a subset or a property of
his own right I think that's probably what
we should do there

818
03:35:13,407 --> 03:35:20,023
they're trying to say is that this could be
another way to do that would have been

819
03:35:22,307 --> 03:35:23,667
and you know we've been this

820
03:35:24,872 --> 03:35:33,249
god dammit

821
03:35:37,430 --> 03:35:43,373
edit path hope I didn't delete it

822
03:35:44,106 --> 03:35:48,997
I think I just did and got it saved

823
03:35:50,301 --> 03:35:57,438
I did he deleted it iPhone stupid

824
03:36:02,565 --> 03:36:07,800
I don't even remember my stuff yeah

825
03:36:09,763 --> 03:36:13,265
so I can't here's where it gets gets dicey
right

826
03:36:13,971 --> 03:36:19,746
why did Kevin Durant choose the mo I still
think Amal is the easiest of the formats

827
03:36:20,430 --> 03:36:22,725
yeah it is because of the nesting

828
03:36:23,152 --> 03:36:28,520
did the ability to Nest other objects easily
is really easy to do in Yermo

829
03:36:29,126 --> 03:36:47,595
and it because it's your editing and all the
time I can't imagine if they do see a sign
for that if they do something else it would
have been still as the best pic and there's
just there's just no there's there's nothing
better if there were any better I would love
to hear about him so

830
03:36:47,866 --> 03:36:54,028
what is it I was refereeing and it's not in
its path

831
03:36:55,660 --> 03:37:02,904
I don't to to do it there is derp

832
03:37:05,036 --> 03:37:06,531
alright so

833
03:37:10,686 --> 03:37:13,907
all right I didn't do it

834
03:37:17,881 --> 03:37:22,647
is weird uh oh

835
03:37:26,743 --> 03:37:29,739
I said turkey man has busted somehow

836
03:37:32,648 --> 03:37:35,878
if I have a broken thing I got to fix real
quick

837
03:37:40,536 --> 03:37:43,327
Eric electrical xeracalm config

838
03:37:47,479 --> 03:37:49,762
it says she's really going to go there

839
03:37:56,750 --> 03:38:00,231
there's an eagle scout side so dark out

if a coaster

843
03:38:46,877 --> 03:38:48,333
hi

844
03:38:52,840 --> 03:38:55,450
I mean I guess we could do now sir

845
03:39:03,181 --> 03:39:05,590
if

846
03:39:09,888 --> 03:39:16,722
do to do to do I don't need to do this

847
03:39:29,588 --> 03:39:32,236
I saw you say this you say

848
03:39:38,677 --> 03:39:45,136
zettaset exist derrico's

849
03:39:46,647 --> 03:39:51,411

850
03:39:58,275 --> 03:40:05,618
crazy sex position and Yamaha yes no
suggestion for the date for the the the
integration right

851
03:40:10,428 --> 03:40:17,607
alright so here we have asked Elsa normally
if we were doing this

852
03:40:19,148 --> 03:40:33,458
Jason of them are interchangeable right so
for the most part of the animal yellow
except Jason you can rent a hundred percent
Json Indiana will file and it's totally
acceptable so if you prefer to use get Json
as your llamo it is yellow

853
03:40:33,613 --> 03:40:54,305
the reverse is not true which is why we have
not yet I'm old so if you're going to
support the animal and Jason name the file.
Yamel and you can write Json in there it is
perfectly acceptable because Jason is
accepted by the way. I am on there then that
means you're accepting the animal and a Json
not just Jason but the reverse is not true
so

854
03:40:54,308 --> 03:40:56,329
so are you dating right now

855
03:40:56,883 --> 03:41:03,109
any one of the things would be the date of
type right

856
03:41:03,110 --> 03:41:07,949
it's so this thing about establishing with
Dave types are

857
03:41:08,327 --> 03:41:18,587
and I don't even remember what the speck was
but we would put something in here to try to
find what type it is like at your at your
eye

858
03:41:19,818 --> 03:41:24,647
I simplify Pennock markdown dragon cayenne

859
03:41:25,578 --> 03:41:31,176
and can tap best beers out of a truck so
here we go this is a thing and it's like
looking up stuff

860
03:41:34,319 --> 03:41:39,798
if you ask questions I mean I need to go
back and read all this again

861
03:41:40,269 --> 03:41:45,196
I do want to keep the the structured data
ability as well do as well

862
03:41:47,084 --> 03:41:51,728
so I don't know what it would be I think it
was like

863
03:41:52,044 --> 03:41:59,141
was it was it like datatype we had some
reserved for some reserved ones then we
would have liked

864
03:41:59,656 --> 03:42:06,791
actually I think it was this I think we had
type and then you know you have like a scale
right

865
03:42:08,982 --> 03:42:41,206
are we doing that I feel like is is is where
I get think I'm getting at is we're
exploring the the exploring the option
thanks for the fine in the can type so I was
looking for that were exploring the option
of having types that are detected by the
markdown a loan that don't have to be
specified by a datafile but if you want to
extend that if you want to add a date at
yamel file you can get more you know a
specific about if you want to make a
structured data and stuff like that

866
03:42:41,867 --> 03:42:57,411
interconvertible without a utility but Jason
is about nesting yet you can do it you just
have to have a tool in general named Jason
on his for a tool it's not it's not designed
for humans is designed for a tool of some
kind and that's fine so then if you want to
use a tool

867
03:42:59,290 --> 03:43:04,655
yeah so

868
03:43:06,240 --> 03:43:11,996
I mean another possibility is that we just
flattened everything to keep value Pairs and
then everything can you store in redis

869
03:43:11,997 --> 03:43:19,626
I've seriously thought about doing that
there's there's not a single thing you know
what let's talk about that for a second

870
03:43:19,627 --> 03:43:26,612
let's talk about that for a second let's
talk about non structured data

871
03:43:27,058 --> 03:43:31,553
that is just keep a pair if we allow for
that

872
03:43:31,553 --> 03:44:04,925
and we use that mean you guys and I'm
already doing this right so that's that's
the idea behind could figure that it is
there is obviously there's a lot of
redundancy in the keys the data the total
amount of data is increased because you have
the complexity of writing they could be full
key every time but the Simplicity of parsing
the data and storing the date is really
really overwhelmingly increased because all
it is is just keep a it's a Java properties
file

873
03:44:04,929 --> 03:44:42,875
and it might look ugly is harder to read
it's not that much harder to edit it does
you know cute in the stuff where you want to
have I mean somebody might make the argument
why don't you just use Json then you know
and put everything is he why would he have
the quote situation going on but you
actually don't get everything just has to do
only the only requirement is that everything
to keep a store has to be 14 line poem from
the line and you would have to figure out
something this is our properties so we have
some pretty lengthy descriptions here

874
03:44:42,879 --> 03:44:44,081
and again these descriptions are

875
03:44:45,353 --> 03:44:51,959
manage through software tools and then the
questions why don't we just use Jason right

876
03:44:52,292 --> 03:45:29,746
I mean it's just as easy to parse Json is it
is anything else but if he was Jason we're
forcing people use it to land a man that's a
question why are we marked on the first
place using markdown we can come over
because you want all of us to be edible by
somebody easily we want them to be able to
go in and do mark down and be done and and
yeah just just nothing tops you more for
that right if you want to go in there and
create a date of schema as fast as possible
you can dump that into into a yamel file and
just be done you just automatically having
it just works then there's that there is
something nice about some for data
structures

877
03:45:29,752 --> 03:46:06,358
you know what do we do we want to allow a
more complex data structures of data. Yellow
files or do we want to just say look you
know every single knowledge node has to have
basic properties that's all you can do
basically labels and annotations labels
annotations and and I'm seriously
considering that I am after having spent a
year with a pro-con list yes we definitely
need one we need to go look anymore but
here's the thing we don't even have to get
into that issue if we allow Q value
properties

878
03:46:06,363 --> 03:46:13,909
right not what's more we don't even have to
have an extra file we can just put it all in
a readme file

879
03:46:14,670 --> 03:46:53,966
we could and the original essential oil was
that an original the criteria for the
essential it was that was that anybody could
do it anybody could do it with minimal
effort and there was not didn't have to
learn the animal didn't know where Jason
they could just do it right and I think I
think labels annotations and tags are things
that the general populace understands
outlining the structures of zooming in and
out most of being really good at NSO thing
to it it's absolutely right it is way easier
to do outline content in in this try to do
this in the yellow file

880
03:46:53,972 --> 03:47:33,443
creating an outline in the yellow file is
fucking painful yeah and because it's so
what we could do is we could extend common
Mark we can extend common Mark with
semantics significance at certain areas so
the first paragraph is the summary a tag
section or something effect when I did the
First Essential if I didn't even use the
words tag I use an emoji because it's
Universal and I thought it was kind of
quirky and fun but I don't mention a banded
that because if you if you put an emoji as a
trigger for a particular somatic section in
your in your, mark

881
03:47:33,448 --> 03:48:04,263
you can use that to use the the you know
that the document itself as its own metadata
the document is the metadata right you don't
need some other structured data if you do
need structured data well what kind of
structures do you really need right I would
I would suggest you know if you're going to
do it then another thing to about keeping
this like this if you want to store your
data given a section and then make a yamo
section and make a store that actually parts
of the animal out of there

882
03:48:04,476 --> 03:48:14,191
so you know I'm saying it's kind of like
yeah you like the emoji with the tool tool
to convert mg DL

883
03:48:14,192 --> 03:49:14,820
if we do this and we stick with, if we stick
with a very solid markdown specification and
we have taken for that's why I fucking did
it is if we have a very solid markdown
specification for the semantics meaning of
the different do we have we have a general
to work the first of all were compliant
hundred percent with common work okay we're
a hundred percent compliant with, Mark we do
not extend that we that's our primary goal
secondly we allow the extension of, Mark to
to include late at La Tech so we can have
math in there and how can mdtm will be
helpful I don't know so then we have another
stage and that stage is you know we allow a
math in there and if we don't have some way
to allow Matt and most pandoc and golden
goldmark support you no K tech and and and
La Tech we're going to call it math notation
we have to have math if you don't support
math and our documentation what's the point
and Anna

884
03:49:14,827 --> 03:49:24,872
Universal standard format citation in
documents so we can put that there and then
if we have a rudimentary methods for tag in
which we already have

885
03:49:24,553 --> 03:49:29,864
write 11 mg and then covered it all seems so
yeah

886
03:49:30,596 --> 03:49:35,573
yeah it seems the thing with the awesomest
of I'm starting to think that we might

887
03:49:36,638 --> 03:50:15,531
I don't know I mean I like you more and all
the structured data but it's also not
user-friendly and if we were fighting
between the mo I want to come back to the
outline thing for a bit okay so outlining
outlining is Pei Wei easier to do in
marketown so let's say let's say that you
want to ride you know I know CMS Prudential
anybody you want to put in an outline format
do these 10 things pick from the fire from
the following and everything and then the
end result is this very very well-documented
outline right and then we can just we can
just stick with Mark down for everything

888
03:50:17,018 --> 03:51:15,739
but but we were the original that the reason
he mentioned Mark Kimberly for mark down to
ATL soon as the animal form at least we
originally envisioned the awesomest
credentials being a very very strict yellow
specification so that that that stuff could
be exchanged their do you know at least
enough reason to discuss it to move away
from you more and to just use markdown
semantic markdown that has meaning and you
know we're already buying into a language
here right I do feel like there are some
extensions that we can do so for example I
have already been following the related
section concept right and do something here
that kind of informs this conversation which
actually allows

889
03:51:15,743 --> 03:51:30,416
tags to be using any number of a hundred
different languages it's like when you
download the tags database it has the the
the English for that tag in any number of
words is a try to get at is the

890
03:51:30,476 --> 03:51:46,424
you know the the specificity here with the
word related could could be added to a group
of keywords that that are part of a semantic
specification and we can stick with common
work

891
03:51:46,628 --> 03:51:58,502
and I I I am more than we get into this the
more I feel like that would be the most
sustainable option for the most people going
for a Big Lots going to stop them from
having to learn a.m.

892
03:51:58,529 --> 03:52:01,002
nobody has to learn yellow

893
03:52:01,030 --> 03:52:59,767
to participate in if you want to participate
and you want structured data okay what's the
extent of structured data on the knowledge
exchange. Tagging so tags is a given and you
know I deliberately indented two spaces so
that I can identify the tags do you know any
consistent way and I think that should be
the thing at one point I made it so that you
can remove tags completely and that would
just be the last thing on his feet on the
file and that could be it too we could say
you know that we could we could create
sections that are that are detected through
very specific semantic things like if the
section is the last section and it has a
hashtag in the beginning it will constitute
you know the tags property of metadata for
the thing and but we can continue this kind
of idea and we can have something like
properties right

894
03:52:59,776 --> 03:53:04,656
at or labels I think labels is probably the
better one

895
03:53:04,657 --> 03:53:14,596
but the problem with labels is they they get
company really fast so we can labels
annotations right so if we did labels

896
03:53:14,597 --> 03:53:21,586
then then we have right so we have I think

897
03:53:21,611 --> 03:53:28,004
I don't even know how I would write labels
say the truth and maybe we can make it

898
03:53:28,005 --> 03:53:35,600
we can make labels into is this where bigger
install comes in yes

899
03:53:35,601 --> 03:53:42,806
so we could have labels labels could be add
to taste hashtag means a tag

900
03:53:42,808 --> 03:53:44,420
yeah

901
03:53:45,070 --> 03:53:53,783
and labels or tags and labels I think you
can cover literally everything we would ever
want to do with tags and labels

902
03:53:53,784 --> 03:54:04,844
my tags and labels right because then people
who create their own semantic things I think
it's all about headers right so let's say
you create a zealot you want to create your
own

903
03:54:03,458 --> 03:54:35,102
genotype for a student you know what you can
do name you know or whatever right you can
make you can make a title you can basically
you can make your own data types based on
the organization the document you can you
can intimidate a tight space on the
organization of the document and then you
could dictate the the semantics of your
thing of labels labels are very specifically
keep a right so you know it would be ocms

904
03:54:35,493 --> 03:54:43,015
icims version equals 2

905
03:54:43,554 --> 03:54:49,705
you know that kind of thing that that's
that's a label

906
03:54:52,018 --> 03:55:03,960
now most marked down for Matt's already
allow this as as was it called as

907
03:55:04,712 --> 03:55:17,291
most markdown formats allow you to put front
matter but I don't want to do for a matter
we know why because front matters mixing
it's crossing the streams and won't be able
to get the first line and get the get the
title every time

908
03:55:17,364 --> 03:55:22,277
it's to indicate level SMS virgin

909
03:55:22,517 --> 03:55:28,985
No Labels are because it version ocms author

910
03:55:29,087 --> 03:55:30,819
you know what I mean

911
03:55:34,551 --> 03:55:38,366
yeah I could do whatever basically

912
03:55:40,260 --> 03:55:53,847
Willie would say for labels as we'd say
labels a label section we don't even have to
have that what we can say is we can say if
you have if you have a code block called
labels

913
03:55:54,015 --> 03:56:01,964
you see what I'm saying you can just call
and labels like that and be done with it and
then and then they would appear

914
03:56:01,964 --> 03:56:41,970
so what am I getting at is we can we can we
can get everything that we were trying to
get out of the emmalyn Jason by putting it
in marketown the difference is is it we're
going to have to create methods for parsing
this out but this is already how are does
its thing so the r programming languages
used to pain. Marked down and you can write
against Kobe Bryant blocks that have it in
there and it just itches as a thing right
with hashtag different labels are keep a
with hashtag don't have a I don't have a
hashtag now

915
03:56:41,974 --> 03:56:44,617
they could we could do that too

916
03:56:44,617 --> 03:56:52,166
we could do that it would just be really
long I would prefer to have a label section
be kind of be kind of clean

917
03:56:52,167 --> 03:56:55,644
you know because if people could potentially
have a lot of them

918
03:56:57,571 --> 03:57:13,625
I mean we could we do you have to have it be
labels we could just have it be data but it
really is a label right and if you don't
know what I'm talking about so so can get
pods do we have it in me to keep up you cute
is vagrants to love

919
03:57:15,245 --> 03:57:17,715
cigarettes so runny

920
03:57:17,715 --> 03:58:04,949
I think it is I want to show you because
everybody's does this community's is all
about the labels it's like a real important
part of it and it has been a very good use
of of of metadata in order to create note
Affinity in in things that only run tainted
alterations and all that's all based on
labeling and labeling is not meditate
meditate labeling metadata but it's two
dimensional metadata and it can go into the
STD database really easily could go in a
register couch or whatever anything that has
Q value pair so if we don't overly
complicated labeling at the other thing
about labeling too is people do shit like
this so they like they'll be like ocms /
right now that you can that you can name
space or labels however you want

921
03:58:04,955 --> 03:58:44,812
and we don't have to create a standard for
labels we can just say this is where you put
labels and then as people make their own
content data types of we can make the core
data types the Quarry in okay data types and
we can say these labels are a part of the
core data types if you want to play in that
in that game you got support here
automatically otherwise you need these
labels in this is another technique that's a
very prevalent throughout all of the
communities called native world is you know
creating certain labels are a part of the
specification for a custom resource
definition of some kind in communities so we
can steal

922
03:58:43,489 --> 03:59:09,223
we can steal good ideas I'm kind of glad I
had a full year of kubernetes to steal some
of their better ideas and to learn some of
the down sides were exactly Emily and aoyama
was a pain in the ass it's the best we got
but I mean mom and papa are going to come
out this right there they're barely going to
be able to use common Mark and if they want
you can give me the label what's 11 what's
anything I had to keep a planter stand

923
03:59:09,539 --> 03:59:54,277
driving criteria for this entire
specification for the knowledge exchange
grid is least common denominator least
amount of Technology Progressive design
because we are making something that we want
everyone to be able to participate in and
all they need all they need to be able to do
is be able to learn common Mark which
anybody can learn in 20 minutes and use a
texted her the end they shouldn't have to
know how to use this front page web
development to or this Jason query thing
that shouldn't even have to know ya Mo
honestly they should just have to know, Mark

924
03:59:54,283 --> 04:00:06,348
and then they say well how do I want to make
it so that I have all my students in there
okay well there's this date of time but just
make sure one of your headers says name and
one of your headers says this and one of
your head or says it's all I can do that

925
04:00:06,460 --> 04:01:07,273
anybody can use mark down in a in a
structured way that thing is really great
about that is that we get all the benefits
of we get all the benefits of the dumb as
well because all the stuff in marketown if
we rented this right we can actually tagged
it in HTML and now if it gets wetter to the
web with a very very easy to use from Play
No JavaScript if you want to do anything
fancy because now we can just park HTML
people this is sitting is so sad about HTML
at one time semantic HTML aloud and it was a
whole mess of effort for the semantic web
which failed miserably at one point HTML was
designed to do this this is what XML was all
about it was going to be able to provide
structure for data to the web and it
radically failed radically failed and now we
have all sorts of dip soup everywhere
there's no making any sense of any of the
date on the web and it's really too bad

926
04:01:07,281 --> 04:02:03,129
because people even use a fucking paragraph
tag anymore you know they did you whatever
the fuck they want to visit the web has
failed as a semantic data exchange it is
totally failed on that front and we have an
opportunity to do that by simplifying write
the bass line so they come in my thing is
hey ya open graph tags they're getting there
but yeah but so we've got you have a header
right and you have a label section you have
a tag section you have your main title at
the top we should be under this amount for
if you wanted to show up in my search
engines and the thing that's great about
having a really simplistic document object
model is that we can allow people to set
their own search criteria based on it so we
can have people create their own SEO tools
very simply and say I want to search for
this key word combination are this rednecks
in the summary of every single page that I
follow

927
04:02:03,134 --> 04:02:08,968
and they can search very easily in the first
paragraph and you can write that code in
fashion in like 10 minutes

928
04:02:08,968 --> 04:03:09,626
so because of the Simplicity of this and the
structure of the specification with regard
to how the content is shared and stored and
we are not going to barge we're not going to
budge on that shit like the web is done
we're going to leave at lockdown you want to
participate in this with your file needs to
look like right we barely saying hey you can
put math in here right at one point I was
going to say if you want to put math in
there you had to put it in a block and I
think I'm starting to feel like we need to
allow we need to allow Kate text map Mark if
you if you choose to use that by the way
that will not work and get a butt butt or
get loud and rendering but it will and it's
not a part of, Mark. So everything that we
use is, Mark plus we're going to do, Mark
plus K-Tech that means if you choose to use
k-tec it will appear as plain text in in in
your

929
04:03:09,632 --> 04:03:24,682
change but you can use in a mathematical
notation we cannot have a universal standard
for replacing all of exchange unless we
agree on a universal model for exchanging
math which is the primary language

930
04:03:23,420 --> 04:04:18,393
primary language of science if we don't have
that it doesn't make any sense that precede
and this is why pandoc supports it out of
the boxes so I pretty much every markdown
variation has some form of support for for
for La Tech or or any of them applications
that it came from that you know the match
Jackson mathml which is a disaster oh my God
mathml is a fucking disaster it's so bad so
so we'll use the international standard but
that's that's an extension for the science
community and we don't tell people about
that unless it's a hey I want to do math
with a okay well you can do this amount of
math in here you know but the standard is
common work and that means Common Market
doesn't mean you know tables that are not
supported in, Mark, Mark doesn't have any
support for tables by the way so I don't
know about that one if you choose to use the
table

931
04:04:18,400 --> 04:04:33,272
you might want to use your get up flavor
tables which are the only ones so what am I,
or there's a huge debate in Nevada mailing
list about tables because they were tables
or just horrible

932
04:04:34,378 --> 04:04:41,189
what's that only of him when you got me any
of them thing I'm not in the oven fan but
yeah

933
04:04:42,187 --> 04:04:47,990
take your scientific notes to any of them is
this logic

934
04:04:49,752 --> 04:04:55,024
that's the first that's the first good use
of you and them I've ever seen

935
04:04:56,535 --> 04:05:03,375
anything that isn't text could have a
hashtag yeah yeah

936
04:05:05,297 --> 04:05:08,293
that critic the color scheme here is Tokyo

937
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:15,758
ask him a generator for latte is definitely
the standard that's that's pretty cool

938
04:05:16,146 --> 04:05:21,410
that's if that's seriously that's the first
real awesome you so many of them have ever
seen

939
04:05:22,350 --> 04:05:25,016
it's an honor, Mark Plus

940
04:05:27,041 --> 04:05:35,390
I start using commands that people are and
then you send me is that link yeah

941
04:05:35,390 --> 04:05:45,102
it might my biggest frustration with is that
stuff is the dependency on get and get them
that's kind of scaring me

942
04:05:46,965 --> 04:05:50,489
but it definitely has work so far so

943
04:05:50,489 --> 04:05:55,604
this is super cool and you have a lot that
is definitely the language of

944
04:05:55,604 --> 04:06:04,847
of of Matt so so yeah I mean if you have an
enable I'd love to see it

945
04:06:04,969 --> 04:06:19,350
so I I I feel like we have some conclusions
here that we can make it so I'm just going
to put it in myself because I can pull him
out of his head and put him some other place
later create a keg

946
04:06:19,352 --> 04:06:24,336
keg specification

947
04:06:24,336 --> 04:06:31,493
conclusions so a couple of things looks like

948
04:06:31,493 --> 04:06:39,003
Isaiah just use common Mark plus math

949
04:06:39,914 --> 04:06:46,323
math for everything I kind of want to say

950
04:06:46,323 --> 04:06:52,065
Plus get up

951
04:06:58,823 --> 04:07:03,178
yeah dynalist

952
04:07:04,274 --> 04:07:08,923
cream best work nice

953
04:07:09,380 --> 04:07:12,618
nice outlining

954
04:07:15,154 --> 04:07:17,815
what's that

955
04:07:17,815 --> 04:07:55,421
Glenn plug-in yeah I don't know it's about
me dr. But I'm free Anthony of in the way
that you guys are you people are using U of
M is completely supported though you're just
using it as an extension of like a Max and
people that are working on the same system
and doing stuff that makes total sense
unless you already know them it creates the
set that Roku and you know I've been are
seeing that it creates a dependencies that
they prevent you from being a structural
engineer because you can't be productive and
other machines besides your impression of
him

956
04:07:55,426 --> 04:08:01,107
yeah yeah

957
04:08:01,108 --> 04:08:04,303
this is cool this is really cool

958
04:08:06,629 --> 04:08:09,252
that's pretty damn cool I won't lie

959
04:08:10,401 --> 04:08:20,579
and you don't maybe I wanted to give them
one day as a replacement for them as long as
you learn how to use them right properly you
know

960
04:08:21,343 --> 04:08:42,777
I would actually prefer to not do this in
him I would prefer to make a filter for this
that would do the conversion for me and then
just run it through the shell script I don't
think this cuz this is this is for forcing
you to use been thought you were Unity at
school but I probably wouldn't probably
wouldn't do it it's just not my style

961
04:08:45,415 --> 04:08:53,763
yeah I would I would prefer to make some
sort of data tool that takes in their inputs
and then does the routing for you

962
04:08:57,429 --> 04:08:58,804
yeah

963
04:08:59,418 --> 04:09:08,513
that's the only problem I mean a lot of the
stuff doesn't have to be any of them any of
them taking over so much graph is one of
them yeah so

964
04:09:08,859 --> 04:09:15,255
yeah yeah for sure what's this one

965
04:09:18,397 --> 04:09:25,223
LOL that was apart of all things what is
this about

966
04:09:27,613 --> 04:09:34,687
I said scammer tools I feel really good
about this this other thing so

967
04:09:38,759 --> 04:09:45,269
comment mark excel's at outlining

968
04:09:46,406 --> 04:09:48,354
Oriental

969
04:09:51,541 --> 04:09:58,033
dropped Emma and Jason from knowledge

970
04:09:59,681 --> 04:10:02,665
no spec

971
04:10:04,950 --> 04:10:12,862
you and Jason can still be included can

972
04:10:16,025 --> 04:10:19,901
just just not just not far this back right

973
04:10:23,854 --> 04:10:27,614
centralized Etsy Focus

974
04:10:27,614 --> 04:10:34,755
focus on readme.md as as as the

975
04:10:35,175 --> 04:10:37,773
Kant main content

976
04:10:43,417 --> 04:10:52,904
increase semantics meaning of read me.
Organization

977
04:10:53,352 --> 04:11:00,427
Adam add

978
04:11:02,144 --> 04:11:08,185
add a labels unblock

to the end of the file code offense

980
04:11:17,372 --> 04:11:20,521
to the end of

981
04:11:24,077 --> 04:11:31,000
for metadata continue to

982
04:11:33,571 --> 04:11:37,219
view

983
04:11:39,558 --> 04:11:44,918
hell oh my God

984
04:11:45,819 --> 04:11:49,216
oh my God we don't even need this

985
04:11:50,778 --> 04:11:54,423
we can just we can just add it

986
04:12:00,326 --> 04:12:06,522
I can put all the metadata in here that's
perfect

987
04:12:06,525 --> 04:12:09,297
all I got it's all we need

988
04:12:12,716 --> 04:12:17,730
email list what you talking about Mozzy

989
04:12:17,972 --> 04:12:42,989
Governor everything goes I'll leave me
wanting something better side of my hand
yeah you didn't text base diagrams by hand I
can see that there's other tools were doing
that though I wouldn't that's not something
I would never put in them I like the Unix
philosophy which I would use a separate tool
for doing that and then I would import that
into my them that's just my style I I don't
I don't like Violet in Unix philosophy
unnecessarily

990
04:12:42,992 --> 04:12:49,347
personally this is my mythis is my my take
on it minor notes public so fantastic

991
04:12:52,248 --> 04:12:59,625
did you get ready to take a look at this
short match tc2 made oh I'll get that

992
04:13:01,876 --> 04:13:07,177
you know I like these to be Lisa's but they
don't you can't use them in some shells

993
04:13:07,824 --> 04:13:17,227
you can't use them in some shows so and that
includes any sub commands so I don't use
them I use I made a whole thing on this is
why I don't like aliases

994
04:13:22,930 --> 04:13:31,542
I always says I only did this I learned this
the hard way I went to go use aliases as
filter commands inside of myself can do it

995
04:13:31,823 --> 04:13:37,673
I can do it so I only use and this is when I
know I'm not going to ever need you summon
subshell

996
04:13:38,465 --> 04:13:45,853
a visual exam function I'm not a fan of the
function key word because you don't need it
so necessary

997
04:13:50,596 --> 04:14:12,337
and you didn't put your oh yeah yeah I see
you supposed to keep it instead of the the
to do the brackets this metal thing I can
see why people like it they like to be able
to search for function yeah I can see why
you would want to do that if you wanted to
just you all your functions in your in your
code that might be a reason to consider redo
it to reconsider doing that myself

998
04:14:13,829 --> 04:14:18,749
yep a look I know operator yay

999
04:14:21,814 --> 04:14:23,799
that is cool

1000
04:14:23,937 --> 04:14:29,915
give me the physical trick that's a cool
trick I haven't seen a combined like that
that's a nice trick

1001
04:14:29,916 --> 04:14:38,568
so this is why I love you put documentation
in here that doesn't have hashtags in front

1002
04:14:38,568 --> 04:14:46,242
it's a cool trick yeah

1003
04:14:47,144 --> 04:14:49,928
I can see data using the function key word

1004
04:14:53,664 --> 04:14:59,748
you got me you got me thinking about that
now and if our security is fancy it's

1005
04:15:01,729 --> 04:15:07,616
there's there's one specific advantage of
doing that and that is being able to grip
out all your functions

1006
04:15:07,977 --> 04:15:18,033
are you can still rip out your functions
really easily not doing this by looking for
the parentheses after the first word right
it's totally doable

1007
04:15:18,792 --> 04:15:20,749
but

1008
04:15:21,870 --> 04:15:26,938
does it make it more readable you know
that's a good question to write

1009
04:15:30,879 --> 04:15:35,915
yeah, I don't play with that for a second
tenfu

1010
04:15:36,635 --> 04:15:44,326
so would you some

1011
04:15:45,638 --> 04:15:49,493
some Echo some

1012
04:15:51,313 --> 04:15:54,722
so this is how I do functions right now

1013
04:15:57,641 --> 04:16:03,608
and then I do so we could say

1014
04:16:04,470 --> 04:16:12,267
understand what that mine is yeah I guess
that's fair you guys are coming from another
language

1015
04:16:12,304 --> 04:16:17,738
yeah yeah you might have convinced me to
start using it

1016
04:16:22,093 --> 04:16:26,398
and he might have convinced me I would do

1017
04:16:29,768 --> 04:16:32,861
all right so we do

1018
04:16:40,192 --> 04:16:43,039
so same thing

1019
04:16:43,039 --> 04:16:56,253
if you wanted to you could do this the
danger with parentheses in both Bosch and
pearl is it you never ever put anything in
the parentheses so if you come from Python
and JavaScript

1020
04:16:57,821 --> 04:17:00,127
yeah

1021
04:17:00,127 --> 04:17:09,832
the reason the main reason I like this is is
this right here grab grab Funk from tenfu

1022
04:17:09,833 --> 04:17:18,208
that is hands-down the easiest way to do
that the alternative to doing that if you
didn't do that I think you just sold me

1023
04:17:18,208 --> 04:17:24,117
I think it sold me on it I fucking hate it
but I think it's sold me on it the alternate
okay so there's two reasons a beginner might
not want

1024
04:17:26,280 --> 04:17:28,035
mellow systems have Bash

1025
04:17:32,605 --> 04:17:36,721
yeah but I've already from portability out
the window because I use double brackets for
everything

1026
04:17:37,090 --> 04:17:46,522
so that's why I started doing it actually
for the reason tell me what sites but I can
see a million reasons not to do that now
that it's real bad out I may throw
everything else over mashup

1027
04:17:49,765 --> 04:17:56,623
to be fair most of the functions that I
write I can go back like this and put in a
safe there and it just works

1028
04:17:57,117 --> 04:18:00,893
website right

1029
04:18:02,047 --> 04:18:09,281
that way I can have stocks in your batch
name this traffic on my phone

1030
04:18:14,699 --> 04:18:17,033
yeah I violate all kinds of things

1031
04:18:19,516 --> 04:18:44,459
panel systems I don't I don't give a shit
about stuff besides bash these days that is
a very dramatic change in my my Approach so
and I'm already doing shit that's not
allowed in the Shell like dots in your names
which I fucking love I'm not changing that
for anything so I think I'm sold there's
there's two reasons that I like this

1032
04:18:44,462 --> 04:18:54,155
the first is it doesn't confuse cuz I think
bash is the first language do most people so
they say look in oh you want to put a few
commands in a thing

1033
04:18:54,790 --> 04:19:02,344
why is there. In the name for this because
cuz of completion

1034
04:19:03,290 --> 04:19:09,414
yeah Bosch

1035
04:19:10,917 --> 04:19:17,308
that's why so I have built-in tab completion

1036
04:19:17,414 --> 04:19:21,427
so anytime so for example have a life
command

1037
04:19:21,428 --> 04:19:33,815
my life had to have right it gives me all of
my completion and to add to add new
completion all I have to do is add a I'll
have to do is add a function that has an X
in front of it

1038
04:19:33,942 --> 04:19:40,034
it's good that I've written that I I like my
daddy blank

1039
04:19:40,354 --> 04:19:46,518
yeah. So you know it doesn't exist right

1040
04:19:49,494 --> 04:19:54,698
now it doesn't get this so X. Foo

1041
04:19:55,864 --> 04:20:08,332
Echo Foo and now I just do live. Tab and I
have food and fluids completable because it
uses Dash so you can PlayStation and then I
have to fuck around with anything else

1042
04:20:08,335 --> 04:20:13,533
so now I don't have it right much do limes
have done

1043
04:20:13,537 --> 04:20:20,508
no I don't have anymore so that code is at
the bottom here it's in my standard

1044
04:20:20,509 --> 04:20:25,113
this is my completion delegation of it

1045
04:20:25,113 --> 04:20:33,583
this is all it takes to do control the
secret going to come in like a lesion
delegation if you're just interested in that
stuff here's that eats for that

1046
04:20:33,584 --> 04:20:38,778
you just get that particular code if you
want

1047
04:20:41,024 --> 04:20:44,451
and yeah it goes through Alexa commands

1048
04:20:45,732 --> 04:20:53,280
as bad as somebody fall to an usher yeah and
thanks for being such a plan is easier if
you need it yeah

1049
04:20:53,282 --> 04:21:14,550
yeah I've moved to Bashas my standard
because it's safer primarily because it's
safer and more powerful like by far itself
up more battery life our hands down under
undeniably the most powerful shell on the
planet and it definitely is way more
powerful than Powershell

1050
04:21:14,588 --> 04:21:35,679
how is this helpful for first programming
students because let me give you a quick
lesson right so far going to teach you shell
scripting right this is how I teach the
reason I stick with Bosch by the way for
beginners is because you're already coding
from the first day of get on the command
line on the link system you are writing code

1051
04:21:35,682 --> 04:22:03,559
and I love to hit that point really hard
because people think I'm not coding now I
can't do the terminal thing know your coding
and your interactive command line is coding
so say like we're going to say prince Echo
you know hello I'm going to say f you know
hello you know dollar s right and I try to
show people you are programming

1052
04:22:04,321 --> 04:22:04,872
yeah

1053
04:22:04,319 --> 04:22:24,178
yeah it's like they think they think they
have the you know sit down and master the
sing the first time you execute a command
your writing code and I'll prove it to him
and the way you prove it to me to say okay
looking member that can you just wrote copy
that is your mouse whatever now we're going
to go open a file with nana leaves don't
know if I have not on here

1054
04:22:24,790 --> 04:22:35,475
he is not on here okay and then you paste it
and see paste it on hers this is an absolute
being a right and say okay look you just
wrote code let's save it I don't even know
how to save

1055
04:22:36,517 --> 04:22:40,848
I know I'm using that right say okay now
it's the script

1056
04:22:41,316 --> 04:22:49,545
I hate this show I hate it I don't
understand why people use it other than this
is our fault and they don't know better

1057
04:22:50,038 --> 04:23:30,469
it doesn't provide any additions and in fact
it creates a dangerous one I did a lot of
reviews the show and there's 13 Elite
dangerous thing that he shall does zycia a
few script in Z show right if using an
interactive your interactive show if you
want to use fischer-z show or something like
that fine I don't because I I want the
cognitive overhead to be zero between my
shell scripting and my shell interactive
line everything that I do and test on the
command line can go directly into a file as
a script yeah and so if you do this so we
can do here so I can say I like to do is I
can tell that smart

1058
04:23:30,472 --> 04:23:34,896
this is a lesson here it was Smart Plus X10
Foo

1059
04:23:35,701 --> 04:23:53,368
yeah if you want to do these shorts are on
the terminal that's why if you have some
fetish for making your your muscles and
fingers completely useless on another system
because you never leave your computer again
my entire universe is

1060
04:23:53,370 --> 04:24:38,356
is is all about being an effective
infrastructure engineer and container and
communities you know developer above
everything else I am not a systems engineer
I'm not I'm not a systems programmer item
systems programmer but I'm not like a a
software engineer I can do it I just that's
not my primary purpose my primary purpose is
being able to work on any system anywhere
and that is a much different set of
priorities than somebody who learned zMAX
and then codes canoe code for the rest of
their life which is like stallman did order
of All Star Vols use a zMAX because he's
dealing with big code based business like
that that's not my primary purpose so I have
a different set of Demands about what I want
to do so

1061
04:24:38,596 --> 04:24:45,253
it is go back to 2 or were they so if we go
back to this this Tempo thing right

1062
04:24:46,079 --> 04:24:59,353
yeah it's so and you just you temp / Foo and
now I can run it like what and I don't even
have to talk about the shipping line why why
don't have to talk about the shipping line

1063
04:24:59,807 --> 04:25:28,971
because the default for anything in his
script is the current running show another
reason not to Ramsey shows predicted for
beginners right because some of the stuff
that I'm going to do like about each other
then the next step the teaching development
and scripting is okay well let's let's
exchange is so sudden if condition if if if
the language equals

1064
04:25:28,974 --> 04:25:32,902
equals equals French

1065
04:25:33,237 --> 04:25:40,593
then Echo Lo-Fi an echo

1066
04:25:41,296 --> 04:25:46,790
Alice Echo hello Echo cellular

1067
04:25:47,319 --> 04:25:52,624
right so now we have a thing as like temp
Foo

1068
04:25:52,624 --> 04:25:56,438
and then you can say

1069
04:25:56,866 --> 04:26:44,362
so does it need to feed the case of dealing
with any system in a computer what they
absolutely don't they don't if you're going
to be a game developer and then we have
different priorities and go grab this code
or are you a visual studio you know I've
been part of this is picking the right tools
for the job and the jobs that I have
concluded to help people with above all are
primarily infrastructure in back-end
engineering jobs now the skills that you
were going to learn their will make you a
kickass web developer ridiculous you going
to call yourself a full-stack web developer
but they're not primarily made for web
development and there's plenty of other
people that will teach you that stuff and
I've decided to just not do it anymore I
thought one of them for years for twelve
fifteen years I was Nike's webmaster I get
it I can do it

1070
04:26:43,506 --> 04:27:43,882
can do it I just I feel like I want to focus
on the skills of infrastructure engineering
and call native you know Enterprise
Computing those are the the core skills that
I really want to promote that include
General skills that the universe is not just
for people that want to be hackers and
security people in back internal users is
its reverie one but some people who might
have professional disagreement about whether
that's needed and stuck me in an eye on who
I think is streaming right now me and I I
believe pretty significantly disagree on the
foundations that are required for you to get
a job in to go home and you don't need to
the world in any case I think it's pretty
safe to say he would say you don't need
terminal and I disagree very via million
strongly with that obviously the guy at all
I just I just strongly disagree that the
terminal skills are not required for web
development even scripting skills I think
knowing that it writes for thing you know

1071
04:27:44,078 --> 04:27:58,240
in other languages mashup sticker is going
to make you overall as the totally better
person as a developer. I don't know what
kind of technology so this is now he thinks
and I can go right now can you export

1072
04:27:58,854 --> 04:28:00,942
laying equals

1073
04:28:02,306 --> 04:28:10,840
equals French and I can run samfu and I fail
why did I feel

1074
04:28:11,902 --> 04:28:19,676
Eagles French oh, did

1075
04:28:21,877 --> 04:28:31,093
sittenfeld yeah so yeah and let's see if
that I see if I made any any horrible checks
security errors on that Chevy

1076
04:28:31,477 --> 04:28:32,903
oh

1077
04:28:33,817 --> 04:28:47,080
depends on the target show at Asha Bangla
what's a shipping line I don't know I'm
going to go read the wiki if you're not
using she'll check you need to start it is
so cool it's like it's like Interactive
Learning

1078
04:28:47,936 --> 04:28:54,966
Ben bash right I'm going to run that now and
we pass

1079
04:28:55,048 --> 04:28:58,479
she'll check really it's game-changing I
completely agree

1080
04:28:59,921 --> 04:29:06,231
yes I could tell you done that to yep that's
another way to do it yeah

1081
04:29:07,118 --> 04:29:14,164
many many ways unsettling

1082
04:29:15,194 --> 04:29:21,414
Thinknoodles French Tamiflu if I do that a
lot actually

1083
04:29:22,638 --> 04:29:28,055
$1,000 a string can I just come by
destroying an exit

1084
04:29:28,881 --> 04:29:31,642
I don't know if I did or not

1085
04:29:31,674 --> 04:29:40,567
so so what do you think of this all before
you go I think we can leave this one alone
now we can put all the tags here

1086
04:29:40,694 --> 04:29:47,720
another Alpha mini commands

1087
04:29:51,337 --> 04:29:56,127
bash commands I think that bash commands

1088
04:29:56,128 --> 04:30:01,123
and then we can have is the first line is
all the tags and then the other is just all
the labels

1089
04:30:01,124 --> 04:30:08,717
and we don't have to do anything else
against

1090
04:30:10,499 --> 04:30:15,638
yeah why not just use like help

1091
04:30:15,639 --> 04:30:21,789
or man tell me why I'm not using that in my
they get something wrong

1092
04:30:22,442 --> 04:30:27,324
help there

1093
04:30:27,336 --> 04:30:35,006
that's the section of the mash man page that
covers that case you didn't know about it
help is a God sent

1094
04:30:35,008 --> 04:30:43,002
as if you don't want to read the like 8,000
line met Batman page what is a plug-in

1095
04:30:43,608 --> 04:30:48,378
a readable cell the our package

1096
04:30:50,944 --> 04:30:57,256
I'm wondering why I would need to steal
something extra to replace something that
already exists

1097
04:30:57,291 --> 04:31:08,751
so it's more readable yeah that's that's not
going to be enough information for me I
appreciate the suggestion thank you for that
that's I don't give a shit

1098
04:31:08,753 --> 04:31:21,875
I'd rather use what's already there and get
used to doing that instead of forcing myself
to as soon as I install something that's not
on a container then I'm already got ready
and got Man pages on the container

1099
04:31:21,876 --> 04:31:28,208
so what's up cuz you are you oh God yes

1100
04:31:29,463 --> 04:31:37,273
seriously I said it says what is the same as
SMS is the is my thing

1101
04:31:38,522 --> 04:31:50,904
and I don't know if I agree with it anymore
I I want to do it but I don't want to keep
it as all comes as many things but primarily
it's a for a way of creating gamified badges
for learning

1102
04:31:51,588 --> 04:32:11,649
that capture a certain number of skills and
that can be earned and that have different
levels of Mastery that's what all comes
badges are that's what they are and I still
want to do it what we're debating about
right now is is is is is how to capture the
documentation that would go with such a
thing

1103
04:32:12,100 --> 04:32:18,126
did the person flying yet totally totally is
and anybody can Define their own right so

1104
04:32:18,837 --> 04:32:23,872
ocms so here's your SMS system in general

1105
04:32:26,206 --> 04:32:32,426
SMS yeah I'll come and razor for sure

1106
04:32:32,572 --> 04:32:35,567
if you cheat until they are sent to far off

1107
04:32:36,472 --> 04:32:55,203
I don't she and I used to make my own stuff
but yeah it looks pretty cool of a
credential manager system for learning is
learning to focus on cutting away and it's a
waste of broken priorities the teaching most
employable skills for pictures on tag I'm
going to need some recognition of teachers
offering places with teachers and mentors

1108
04:32:55,698 --> 04:33:34,930
organizing learning objects into a corner so
quickly called badges so badges it are or
what we get is based on The Scouting program
and you created badge and the badge covers a
bunch of stuff and if you want to know
exactly what the badge cover you can go read
the read the message out that I'm actually
kind of rethinking at this moment the llamo
specification for this which was always kind
of on the edge for me I'm not against it but
I am now starting to think that I could I
can possibly avoid

1109
04:33:34,935 --> 04:34:04,796
avoid and I'm wondering if we could create a
format and I'll give you a look at yours I'm
wondering if we could create a format that
basically creates this information by using
not yet Able by using data type
knowledgeable datatype and end the thing of
it is is that we could then all these
prerequisites in philosophy and shit right
this canal

1110
04:34:05,056 --> 04:35:06,006
I consider it a job interview the ideas is
it they would they would be self validating
in other words the number one challenge is
to learning and technology is knowing what
to learn that's the first thing that
addresses here's what at least I think or
you think or some group thinks you should
learn to earn the vagrant Badger the
kubernetes badge right, one badge here's
what I think you should learn and it starts
out by just just being a listing of the
things in the skills you should be able to
do and this specific at the time of the
writing of this it was a mixture of produce
this essay about this topic like you would
see in The Scouting program produce you know
create your own at home it would basically
have several built-in projects to it and and
then you would work with them into her
yourself to sign off on the badge and then
you take out the bed and then and you can
eventually list of ads but more importantly
you could you can list the stuff you

1111
04:35:06,012 --> 04:35:54,546
did while earning a badge in your resume and
we make sure that it didn't smell that's in
Leon's work like a tutorial right it has to
be stuff that you did uniquely so so each
badge could be could constitute you know a
segment of learning again it's almost
directly models after the Boy Scout program
the difference is that you have different
levels of mastering within a single guy to
be like level one of them right level to
volume level three of them and and at the
time I run into had five levels of Mastery
but I think we're probably going to have
three we're going to have you know Basic
Essentials you know and then we have the
fundamentals and then we have proficiency
and if your profession that means you don't
get a script for example and I kind of think

1112
04:35:54,552 --> 04:35:56,279
so

1113
04:35:56,279 --> 04:36:04,923
is that right yeah it's so and if it's if it
if it if you're if you're even if we get it
out there enough you get me can have a
credential

1114
04:36:03,320 --> 04:36:05,859
can have a credential that would say

1115
04:36:06,806 --> 04:36:16,916
this see this right here by the way. I got
distracted you see this this is me
struggling with being able to do a outlining
without having outlining I feel really good
that were throwing yellow out of this

1116
04:36:17,128 --> 04:36:55,944
I really do because this right here I was
like I cannot scripting posix variables
types numbers right so entry entry confident
and Mastery and kind of yeah it's a tough
word right eye that they words I was using
was Essentials fundamentals and proficiency
and if you if you add those words to the end
if you add those words to the end of the
title of the badge you should be able to get
it so and I had excellence and Mastery
Mastery for me was like much much higher
right that's like you can give a talk on it
and then I dropped Excellence of Mastery I'm
going to drop those because it's too much

1117
04:36:55,949 --> 04:37:21,970
so it's like then Basics right then you can
like them Basics you can have level one is
Basics been Basics Fitness scentuals level
two and then proficiency is level 3 we can
probably throw out proficiency put Master
either could change to change master to
proficiency make sense either one

1118
04:37:22,568 --> 04:37:59,963
and proficiency means I can I can do this on
a job Mastery means you know I kind of feel
like Master should be for an excellent
should be five that means that you've gone
above and beyond and you fucking written
books on it and shit right I just don't know
that we need a 4 and 5 level you know maybe
we do maybe we do maybe we need to have a
level four b b mastering when you say your
master then the first thing I'm going to ask
you is how is your interrupt you I didn't
learn bench with okay then you didn't Master
Vin

1119
04:37:59,969 --> 04:38:08,611
if you can't say you master kneel then
without mastering Lua if you haven't written
Lua plug-ins any of them you have not
mastered the Bap location

1120
04:38:08,611 --> 04:38:27,959
that's a master a master we're talkin right
if you can use them to edit files and get
work done every day and you have minimal
awareness of how to use the filter command
for Unix yeah you're proficient you can
you're proficient in vent but you're you
haven't mastered them

1121
04:38:28,573 --> 04:39:08,535
yeah I think Masters really she will sense
things change so much more than any other
reason I don't like the word Mastery because
Mastery usually means that you know I feel
like it could be low before though I think
it could be a level 40 level 4 base know I
have read the Batman page I know every
fucking thing there is to know about Bosch
I've written tons of code & Bash I could I
could give a dissertation on it you know I
don't but but if I haven't even Master bash
I mean I consider myself pretty pretty
proficient with bash and I still don't
consider myself having mastered Bash

1122
04:39:08,540 --> 04:39:26,182
I don't I think that there is just so much
faster and that's I think the point you're
making that start with three and then
consider 4 and 5 if you can. I think you're
right sad cookies I think that's the way to
go I think I think I think the first 3 or
the way to go but it's really hard to
distinguish when something goes in a
category ever had that problem

1123
04:39:26,187 --> 04:39:42,131
but I'm really glad I have a levels because
this is why when I was going to do the Boost
yeah this chicken in the egg situation right
so let me give you an example in order to
achieve then proficiency you have to be able
to edit your Venom RC script

1124
04:39:42,133 --> 04:40:02,942
but you can't edit your Venom RC script
until you have them basic knowledge you see
what I mean here so you can't you see it's
so if you list the requirements for the
badge to be everything on the proficiency
level you can't actually fulfill it because
you don't you're not proficient enough to do
it

1125
04:40:02,944 --> 04:40:31,377
didn't even do the basics it one of the
greatest breakthrough as was the leveling
thing and then their badges I have that so
so yeah you would go into it you start out
you start out with level 1 Basics like okay
I can edit files and survive Basics I used
to call it survival and actually most of my
stuff in order picture I was like the I
Survived it's like you know like markdown
survival right VI survival and actually how
to think you guys might like it actually

1126
04:40:33,490 --> 04:40:36,477
yeah I survived

1127
04:40:36,477 --> 04:40:44,757
the I Survived is is how you can replace
event Nana with Ben into it if it's actually
easier to use VI

1128
04:40:43,544 --> 04:40:54,185
how to use VI the Nano it's easier for
beginners to learn if they are in the Nano
if you allow them to use the arrow keys
which would be something we would do at a
basic level

1129
04:40:54,455 --> 04:41:42,627
and then that proves it you can go look
there's only like there's like three or four
things I've taught nine-year-old c i I had a
bounty out for anybody that could find me
any organization in the world that taught
the item 9 year olds and I didn't and that's
what we did that's exactly what it is to
change so quickly so I brought it be and is
anyone you can play Master Trinity's yeah
yeah it says it's like saying you master
Lenox you know I hate adventurous I've seen
I've tried them adventures in the classroom
environment and found out why I don't like
it the best way to learn a thing is to use
the thing as it was intended my opinion I
thought I was going to really like I didn't
I hated and the kids who came out of him
Avengers had no idea how to use been

1130
04:41:43,790 --> 04:42:06,397
the best thing so far as been tutoring even
answer a lot and I've been wanting to make
my husband to her since the beginning yeah I
wanted to make a replacement I have knows I
have extensive notes about how to improve in
tutor somewhere and I want to take all of
those notes were actually taken in the heat
of battle while I was teaching people then
and it was all the stuff that I wanted to
change over news

1131
04:42:07,843 --> 04:42:22,147
I can't make the info from Adventure sick
next I don't know since before I cussed him
two games with people liking games is is
games don't teach you the skills they teach
you how to play the game

1132
04:42:23,564 --> 04:42:26,496
I hate to put it that way but it's true

1133
04:42:28,461 --> 04:42:35,110
some games like you know I don't know like
nitro type or something they do teach you to
type and stuff but

1134
04:42:35,111 --> 04:42:49,248
yeah I would I would rather people learn to
learn to type in to do Vin while their
coding because you know that in my opinion
that's that's the faster way to to do it we
are done in FS

1135
04:42:49,527 --> 04:43:31,998
TGIF I think you're right I think you're
right I think suffering through the actual
thing doesn't to is it all new mnemonics you
know the all the active recall the pneumonic
held at all this science about you know
learning is it you're going to associate
your VI skills with the task at hand if you
if you if you build all these other
associations with with with this unit pretty
game then they don't trigger they don't
trigger weight of a sudden you were like on
a command line you're terrified you're like
oh my God I'm using VI you don't you don't
associate that it's that nice happy them
game you were playing before you think it is
a terrifying thing what but if you learned
to do it that way in the first place they're
not terrified because this thing you know

1136
04:43:32,007 --> 04:43:53,197
and so I'm I am a strong Advocate on
eliminating gamification when you could do
something real and that includes things like
replicant things like where you go out to a
coding you code.org whatever the fuck right
and yeah you make a web page on the website
now actually make a web page while I don't
know how

1137
04:43:53,198 --> 04:44:14,033
you don't know where to put the days to mail
you don't know where you would hosted you
don't know how to get to file their you
don't know how to edit the file on your
local system cuz use the fucking web browser
for your editing you don't have any of the
essential skills for doing the judge you're
completely useless but you got your
certificate saying that you're a bona fide
web developer

1138
04:44:14,035 --> 04:44:16,960
I'm picking up freecodecamp on that one

1139
04:44:17,911 --> 04:44:32,648
I can toddler curiosity test to the point
that I agree completely yes I do agree that
all right so I feel like we've got some
summations here

1140
04:44:33,787 --> 04:44:36,668
yeah I was just

1141
04:44:36,669 --> 04:45:01,746
dang some stuff I got to make some some some
recaer and then I'm going to make dinner is
coming pretty soon I'll be taking a break I
will be probably coming back tonight to do
some more relaxing things like games or
whatever but I'm really enjoying this so I
don't know what our next the next Lab is
probably going to be tomorrow and we'll
probably will be doing it if it's shit

1142
04:45:04,425 --> 04:45:09,099
Jurassic I'm so sorry for you to have to go
there

1143
04:45:09,099 --> 04:45:17,597
are you getting over you do need it you need
it for the older that's why we did it yeah
this is been a good session for a dog

1144
04:45:18,387 --> 04:45:24,748
anx are also Central Command Center is an
arrow and I don't get you the end of the
line for some reason

1145
04:45:23,780 --> 04:45:47,880
for some reason I agree band in 60 seconds
the purpose of that is like I wanted to use
the absolute minimum number of commands
directly related to what you would have to
know in Nano so I literally said what is the
absolute necessary keystrokes to be able to
edit a file and exit in VI

1146
04:45:48,273 --> 04:45:55,447
LA Zoo hours on Sunday if you want any
weekly sessions if he works I do want to do
that I don't know

1147
04:45:56,197 --> 04:46:01,049
and BMO my God different yeah

1148
04:46:01,600 --> 04:46:04,984
yes we did was I said I'm kind of people
through there

1149
04:46:05,103 --> 04:46:19,198
yeah I'm not I'm not proud and the proud
yeah that's why I got so mad is because
people paid me money to send him through
freecodecamp and help him out with that come
out of that had no fucking skill at all and
I had to reteach to a mall

1150
04:46:19,297 --> 04:46:45,548
and that's her real parents breathing down
your neck saying hey what a my kid learn and
I'm like nothing like why didn't either
anything well we tried to use this official
freecodecamp course I didn't wash it and
like that and I will why did you pay for
Coke at me because everyone says it's the
thing to do and I guess I'm like a
significant thing there wasn't one of the
teachers that parents would talk to me about
a mostly parents like oh my God

1151
04:46:45,565 --> 04:46:49,324
still sitting on their kids wall and
meanwhile they can't do shit

1152
04:46:53,716 --> 04:47:01,386
I think there was a couple of parents I will
confess that I was like you know

1153
04:47:01,713 --> 04:47:16,587
I'm just going to let him think that they
learn something here and let him take it
away God knows the rest of the fucking world
is doing that it's a hose but I feel dirty
doing it I was like no your kid doesn't know
shit they don't know shit and it was

1154
04:47:16,588 --> 04:47:19,260
I chatted. Manager

1155
04:47:20,260 --> 04:47:34,165
as soon as you receive a tax Annex isn't too
bad I mean there's some stuff the free that
Lennox the freeletics stuff is pretty
interesting how's it going command Commander
Charles Charizard

1156
04:47:35,044 --> 04:47:37,371
fishing reels goes down

1157
04:47:37,502 --> 04:47:52,183
biggie Ikes is so Google just like
University degrees in promoting surgical
products yeah there is a certified
certificates work

1158
04:47:52,183 --> 04:48:02,922
and universities are not working they're not
to universities are not working by every
objective measure they are not producing
employable people

1159
04:48:02,923 --> 04:48:07,669
they're not it was like crazy so

1160
04:48:07,669 --> 04:48:22,888
you know the first thing I would say is why
are you thinking so shallow lie about about
University education the value of their
value of a university education is
intangible

1161
04:48:25,275 --> 04:48:34,397
my hell yeah it's intangible I can't fucking
eat next week thanks to your intangible
degree I got from stand for the cost me
$20,000.

1162
04:48:36,793 --> 04:49:05,862
Is suggesting to a university Professor to
somebody over there that that what they're
doing that they are not teaching people that
have employable skills makes them cringe and
makes him cranky cuz I think how dare you
simplify College as the college experience
as being something to get a job it's so much
more than that were expanding their Horizons
letting them do beer bong parties and
everything else that a child needs at this
age

1163
04:49:07,241 --> 04:49:17,245
let me just just consider the amount of
money we spend on a football team alone can
you imagine robbing a child of their
experience to attend a college football game

1164
04:49:17,245 --> 04:49:23,407
just so they can get a job something as
shallow as getting a job after they leave
College

1165
04:49:23,408 --> 04:49:29,598
oh it's so pedestrian how dare you how dare
you

1166
04:49:31,450 --> 04:49:35,029
did you hear we're adding Esports

1167
04:49:39,156 --> 04:49:46,835
expensive full degree I know and that's what
that's what's happening like oh yeah there's
money in this we're going to make we can do
better

1168
04:49:49,281 --> 04:49:55,663
the problem is there's a complete disconnect
between theater, that this is what this is
what we were talking about this morning

1169
04:49:55,664 --> 04:50:02,119
this how I started the day I started writing
about that I wrote an article about that yep

1170
04:50:02,119 --> 04:50:07,308
I literally wrote about that just this
morningeducation practical or theoretical

1171
04:50:09,355 --> 04:50:14,683
this is that is a little little little
thoughts I had on that

1172
04:50:16,560 --> 04:50:34,561
Sew-Vac it gets worse even crazy old guy
yeah go look it's insane how much money
they're dumping into that you know why they
can't get kids to go to college anymore I
feel like if we don't have you or somebody
wants to come here I want to go to fucking
football game or lacrosse for god sakes

1173
04:50:35,572 --> 04:51:28,782
dispense a college how dare you question
college football oh my God if you question
the amount of money that's dumped into
college football in America even though
you're a particularly Germany separates all
of their extracurricular activities from
their academic instruction my wife loves
reminded me that every time he goes no
that's totally stupid chess club at school
what the fuck Sports in school no school was
for learning you go to school to learn and
then you come home at like 4 or 5 and you
join a club you join a club you don't have
soccer club you joined in this club that
stuff is tied to the education system it
separate because it makes fucking sense to
do that why the hell would you like putting
associated with the thing and then forced
people to pay it then pay the fucking
football coach / Health instructor who bucks
cheerleaders on this side 90 to 100 Grand
more than you know more than the principal

1174
04:51:28,791 --> 04:51:44,729
dude it's it's so messed up American
education is just so fucking messed up if
you if you question Saturday night Friday
Night Lights football or you question in
college football in America you will get
shot in the face

1175
04:51:46,427 --> 04:52:35,068
if you if you like give it if you give him a
bill you say look when you question out of
the military spending you question Sports
spending or military spending in the United
States and get ready for a fucking fight
because they just don't want to have it they
won't even talk about it they don't even
talk about it confuses they are you see a
big future Generations terms of learning
absolutely be in the next life will be home
schooling our kids there's a lot of people
doing that we did some of those two really
great thing about homeschooling is that both
the conservatives and liberals agree on that
so if you're an independent or in the middle
or something you can do that in school from
8 to 6 because of the activities that my
school offered in the afternoon really
that's that's that's unusual

1176
04:52:35,077 --> 04:52:40,423
because you wanted to interesting over the
activities were they were they

1177
04:52:40,423 --> 04:52:43,987
with a extracurricular with a learning
activities

1178
04:52:45,047 --> 04:53:05,332
and I can't I can give that back to my wife
hasn't been in Germany and God 20 years
Google require University reason their job
listings not all of them but saying they
didn't require Matt Damon IBM in a bunch of
others in 2013 they signed an affidavit
saying we do not require a college degree to
people have the skill

1179
04:53:05,543 --> 04:53:10,235
other but I searched the same University
yeah

1180
04:53:11,664 --> 04:53:24,986
there's no doubt then Amazon and and Google
and big companies like that are Facebook try
to do to actually interview with Facebook
for if an education job I did not last very
long

1181
04:53:25,765 --> 04:53:31,721
they're they're realizing that the
traditional schooling system is failing and
then I can do to make money

1182
04:53:31,723 --> 04:53:39,942
and so they're not trying to make money off
the education so much as they're trying to
get people to do the skills so they can
still sell their product

1183
04:53:39,942 --> 04:53:46,829
some further prison for having an affair
with subordinate is sorry I was like are you
fucking kidding me

1184
04:53:46,829 --> 04:53:51,643
for two years after being fired after being
fired you kidding me

1185
04:53:51,853 --> 04:53:55,404
welcome to America

1186
04:53:57,570 --> 04:54:05,557
welcome to America America yeah

1187
04:54:06,853 --> 04:54:09,529
oh my God

1188
04:54:11,376 --> 04:54:19,120
oh my God that's just terrifying

1189
04:54:22,673 --> 04:54:25,239
Ayano

1190
04:54:25,271 --> 04:54:31,379
I don't know man it's getting busy right

1191
04:54:31,420 --> 04:54:43,212
here's the conclusions again I'm going to
drop the stream for a while and then we can
raise some money from it if I come back and
probably just be game to gaming tonight I
feel like we did a lot of really good stuff
today

1192
04:54:46,966 --> 04:54:54,737
yeah if I guess I didn't read me as the main
content increase magic meeting I've even
had.

1193
04:54:55,736 --> 04:55:01,376
Add labels add

1194
04:55:04,254 --> 04:55:05,732
labels

1195
04:55:11,679 --> 04:55:13,141
after

1196
04:55:16,765 --> 04:55:23,106
in final code in Final it's called a
Verbatim section I think

1197
04:55:26,946 --> 04:55:31,216
I dropped the Emoji so from now on it's back

1198
04:55:34,169 --> 04:55:40,235
if people still want them they can still use
them you can watch it and everything, Marcus
isn't letting

1199
04:55:40,959 --> 04:55:52,682
so I think that's going to really simplify
things

1200
04:55:53,380 --> 04:56:00,697
noted the similarity between

1201
04:56:03,064 --> 04:56:10,007
ZK and keg stuff alright so

1202
04:56:12,250 --> 04:56:14,074
is there any template

1203
04:56:17,998 --> 04:56:25,345
how to invert a battery Tree in order to get
hired I don't think they have yet we still
have to do that with a memorize that

1204
04:56:25,744 --> 04:56:37,132
which I can't do still I can't do it nope if
I can make fun of me if I tried I should
probably

1205
04:56:38,904 --> 04:56:42,805
I mean I lost more productive things to do
right

1206
04:56:44,428 --> 04:56:52,594
but this is the book apparently and
money-grubbing Gail asshole on the back

1207
04:56:53,864 --> 04:56:57,139
she makes so much money off this shit

1208
04:56:58,456 --> 04:57:15,099
founder and CEO of career Cup and the author
of cracking the p.m. interview and cracking
the tech interview has a strong back on his
self development have working the sufferings
you're in a Google Microsoft and Apple and
Google She interviewed hundreds of software
Engineers evaluated thousands of hiring
packets

1209
04:57:15,101 --> 04:57:32,187
as a part of the hiring committee she holds
a BSC in an embassy and computer science
university of Pennsylvania an MBA from
Wharton she now consults with tech companies
to improve their hiring process make them
have the coding interviews and we started to
prepare for acquisition interviews

1210
04:57:33,722 --> 04:57:49,311
I am not a recruiter I am a software
engineer and as such I know what it's like
to be asked to whip up for Lee Niagara isn't
on the spot and right Flawless code on the
web for I've been through this as a
candidate and as an interviewer and why
don't you put an end to that shit

1211
04:57:49,313 --> 04:57:56,244
because you can make money at it if you help
others do it too that's why

1212
04:57:56,937 --> 04:58:01,318
that book is unavailable on Kindle and they
make a new edition every year

1213
04:58:03,454 --> 04:58:10,147
it says it called multiple streams of income
I'm sure that she's very aware cuz she went
to Wharton

1214
04:58:10,148 --> 04:58:16,985
he's running a business he knows what's up
reenact

1215
04:58:19,478 --> 04:58:28,822
I know he started cutting interviews I can't
talk about them rationally I'll get so
pissed off and it's not just because I can't
do them it's because they're wrong

1216
04:58:29,081 --> 04:58:31,595
I also can't do them

1217
04:58:32,719 --> 04:58:38,881
Brandon operations guy don't need to thank
God it's not the reason I like operations
better

1218
04:58:39,218 --> 04:58:42,040
it's more about the stuff that matters

1219
04:58:44,513 --> 04:58:49,055
this is what I got from that is that she's
our peace in the quarter get a reason

1220
04:58:50,426 --> 04:59:11,758
it wasn't one of the turnpike yeah they're
not they're not they're not they're not even
objectively scientifically a good measure of
your intelligence or ability do anything in
that such as they really aren't go look at
the science on this there's tons of people
that agree with me on this most of them are
well much smarter than me

1221
04:59:12,884 --> 04:59:22,092
I mean there's our kicks pacification of
luden's and I feel like we can put that to
bed now

1222
04:59:22,092 --> 04:59:24,912
which makes you very happy I

1223
04:59:24,178 --> 04:59:31,555
I don't think we need to like stressed out
and all the stuff anymore we just need to
just see if you choose still cast and
linking and

1224
04:59:31,829 --> 04:59:35,801
some kind of structure will come out of this
we don't need to overthink it Rob

1225
04:59:37,476 --> 04:59:40,756
the badge however I want to still do

1226
04:59:44,793 --> 04:59:48,019
I don't know how we're going to do that next
so next Sunday

1227
04:59:48,886 --> 05:00:03,354
next Sunday I'm going to be thinking about
how to develop the Boost contents we have we
have 100 days left of the booze people 100
days 16 hours and change

1228
05:00:03,924 --> 05:00:09,983
so next Sunday we are going to be figuring
out

1229
05:00:10,802 --> 05:00:30,035
how to write this right now I've been just
running the outline form for the Boost and
make sure to hit all the points that are
needed to cover an idea actually starting at
4 for next Saturday because ready boost for
Community stuff it is very organic right now
and it's probably going to stay that way

1230
05:00:30,445 --> 05:01:20,865
and the outline of just be a guideline but
it's very possible that while we're talking
about it we're going to realize something
that's needed during the process I'm going
to adapt the I'm going to adapter the
learning sessions as we go I have that's
been a standard thing I've done at
steelstacks since the very first day
sometimes I throw out an entire language and
doing another new language the next week I
think it's really really important that were
able to adapt and be content as we go and
that is the greatest advantage of Community
Learning is is the ability to do immediately
adapt and to chase that rabbit-hole to an
extent it's also the ability to keep
yourself from going too far down the rabbit
hole which I suck at thanks for the picture
that is very nice

1231
05:01:21,616 --> 05:01:37,230
as rain as my kind thank you and so that's
kind of a rat and a lot of this is going to
be these challenges and I don't know where
the challenges go you know what I mean

1232
05:01:37,232 --> 05:01:40,217
I don't know where the challenges go

1233
05:01:41,726 --> 05:02:38,479
I think the last time we talked about this
the badges and the challenges are so they're
not the same right the challenges are our
exercises week this is the thing that we
need to figure out where these artifacts go
right so we have the Boost outline this is
what we're going to cover today right and
I'm thinking that the Boost will be composed
of some sort of combination of exercises
that allows to solidify learning quickly
challenges which are exercises that are
times that kind of thing and projects many
projects and larger projects that it that it
that are some of which are canned at some of
which area of your own invention and with a
certain amount of discussion and her
programming as we go so I think that that's
going to be the magic sauce there

1234
05:02:40,071 --> 05:02:44,153
and that's that's nothing unique that's
that's pretty much whatever you

1235
05:02:44,858 --> 05:02:50,547
that's whatever you know continent content
is

1236
05:02:50,599 --> 05:02:58,075
I kind of want to come over and put that
into the Moose notes though I forget

1237
05:02:58,953 --> 05:03:06,604
combination of and then we'll do exposition

1238
05:03:07,795 --> 05:03:10,745
exercises

1239
05:03:12,324 --> 05:03:21,173
an exercise and a challenge is kind of the
same I think they're really the same thing
challenge is just a funner a word

1240
05:03:21,173 --> 05:03:28,889
and a projects so what's wrong with the
projects are

1241
05:03:28,890 --> 05:03:34,494
General me yes they are I need to start
doing more cardio

1242
05:03:34,494 --> 05:03:40,726
I'll be the first to admit Exposition
exercising challenges

1243
05:03:42,575 --> 05:03:50,106
what's a discussion about that discussion
slash stories

1244
05:03:51,368 --> 05:03:56,505
stories discussion

1245
05:03:59,865 --> 05:04:06,631
challenges I'm going to call a challenges
challenges is just another word for it's
aanother word for it's a cooler word for
exercise

1246
05:04:07,574 --> 05:04:14,627
right exercises guy to challenges not

1247
05:04:15,098 --> 05:04:19,631
this is good this is good

1248
05:04:20,250 --> 05:04:27,286
oh my God that's got is really good yam

1249
05:04:28,995 --> 05:04:36,575
yeah the exercise and exercise has got a
spotter a challenges in a spotter that's
exactly what it is

1250
05:04:37,030 --> 05:04:42,874
holy shit His Brilliant that is brilliant

1251
05:04:45,585 --> 05:04:49,893
where to put that God dammit

1252
05:04:52,728 --> 05:04:58,662
they put it in my cake stuff I was in Kik

1253
05:05:03,009 --> 05:05:10,251
Empire yagos like I think I don't know if
it's there yet

1254
05:05:13,982 --> 05:05:18,958
I got it I got to put that down I'm going to
actually I was going to make it out of my
like I'm losing

1255
05:05:21,044 --> 05:05:25,254
exercise as

1256
05:05:37,992 --> 05:05:44,354
curious elk I nailed the difference

1257
05:05:47,395 --> 05:05:55,361
between so are things

1258
05:05:57,788 --> 05:06:06,166
yes that that that has been no no okay so
we'll have exercises discussion story
exercises

1259
05:06:06,560 --> 05:06:33,040
and and in challenges which is like okay
you're going to do your thing and then went
project project project project project
generally implies that something bigger
right it's going to take more than a day or
more than 5 minutes and exercise is
something you should be able to finish
within you know 10 20 minutes if that the
Mary most an hour and exercise should never
go past an hour carrying routine

1260
05:06:33,432 --> 05:06:34,899
yes

1261
05:06:37,358 --> 05:06:41,682
Ellis Pottery risk asphyxiation death yes

1262
05:06:42,310 --> 05:06:53,152
but then if you want to have a challenge I
know I challenged you to spot her I know so
we'll just say like how about a guide you
don't have a guide in the morning guiding
you through

1263
05:06:54,301 --> 05:06:56,137
Richard Shelton

1264
05:06:59,920 --> 05:07:03,051
I'm out of culture I see

1265
05:07:10,803 --> 05:07:12,923
oh God

1266
05:07:16,794 --> 05:07:23,860
I just have no comment about that nobody
here gets that probably better they don't

1267
05:07:26,680 --> 05:07:33,061
asaba why you hanging closet breathless

CHRISTUS Health

1282
05:09:34,267 --> 05:09:39,761
it's unless you slam your programming it's
profanity yes it is

1283
05:09:40,669 --> 05:09:43,358
I haven't bad jokes

1284
05:09:44,783 --> 05:09:53,512
we do need to do like like yeah I'm like
randomize on the screen or something like
when I'm away or whatever

1285
05:09:54,629 --> 05:09:59,123
yeah that be funny I would definitely be
