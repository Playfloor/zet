1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:59,047
okay it says our stream we're going to be
doing some more time with terraforming we've
been all over the map been chasing down
rabbit holes with ansible and live birds and
kmoo a KVM and Xanadu and all the difference
for me along with the Saga you know that the
end goal for me is to get a running
multi-node kubernetes environment that I can
blow up on purpose that's running on this
machine that has eight cores and 16 MB of
ram are gigabytes and I don't know it is to
be able to do it but the thing that will
ultimately testing is how quickly can we
bring a bunch of Aeons up we tried vagrant
and failed miserably because it's so old and
out of dated into a buggy and this seems the
terraformed can do those same things locally

2
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:50,923
he's been a good five hours trying to get
live bird to work with terraform last time
we did this I'm happy to report that
somebody else was helping us today while we
were playing with ansible they were like
onions I was curious why delivery thing
wasn't working for us while we were using
Camuto to provision stuff and they ended up
saying get me when I'm getting it to work we
got liver to work so I plan on returning
back to the terraforming project for a local
development and we might have to the band it
again but right now I want to see if we can
actually use liver as a provider and see if
we got around the permission from that was
stopping this before so that's just an
overview of what's planned

3
00:01:52,236 --> 00:02:50,864
I do wonder if terraform is going to be more
work than necessary and I could just put a
bunch of chemo mashed together to provision
those things but as I said before I would
rather invest learning time in doing
something that's reusable everywhere and
telephone providers are we definitely more
reusable same with ansible right
ansible-playbook Sandown hocks and all that
stuff so this is a diversion from the
ansible as a workstation thing I was doing
today and just do it was summarized to this
isn't over people who have different
interpretation of this but so far my take on
terraform is a terraform to form things and
bring them up and then I use answerable to
you know connect with them and can figure
them and that is the goal another change
today as I get into this that is that I will
be doing this using Cent OS which is
Upstream from Pandora

4
00:02:50,870 --> 00:03:51,111
and downstream from you know Red Hat
Enterprise Linux it is the closest to Red
Hat Enterprise Linux you can get if you want
to read about my why I changed my feelings
on red hat I wrote a thing about that you
can read it myself a casting if you know how
to get their bottom line Red Hat has
undeniable control over Enterprise Linux at
this point so you know the same reason that
I used for tomorrow for 14 years and I am as
my desktop and you know to be good with her.
I think I'm going to stick with red hat as
the base server OS for the cluster in a few
minutes cuz I'm going to build stuff in
there one of the main that compelling
reasons for doing that was the report from
one of our community members about Cent OS
and red hat just doing live bird correctly
without the permission from the cost me five
hours

5
00:03:51,116 --> 00:04:41,954
the other day is a specific problem that
they had experience with Ubuntu only and it
does not happen on red hat and it makes
sense since redhead manages and owns KVM and
then and and and give him a live Burton
ansible and pretty much everything else so
so that's where we're going to go and that
the change because my current rules that's
are for this is a whatever you want to call
it this is my I think my current my current
set files are for 12 and I may be changing
these to use a red Hat's a room in which I
have not yet downloaded I am going to try to
use the existing images that we had just for
the sake of seeing if we fix the problem
that we were having before

6
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:47,624
and I wrote about the fix by the way that's
also in maisel cast and titles and it's
called

7
00:04:48,646 --> 00:05:36,653
here it is 12 Papa was fixed for limber
delivered manager that's completely
documented there if you want I'll just go
ahead and edit that real quick this is the
document and fix that chunky chunky skill
helped us set up after all of it a lot of
smart people broke their heads on this
problem chunky still was able to talk us
through how to get this song to be fixed
most because they reported they've done this
themselves many many many times before to
get around problems specifically with Ubuntu
and so the report is anyways that this
problem does not exist with red hat so but I
first want to confirm that this may or may
not have fix the problem that we were having
with her from earlier and we can go from
there

8
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:38,773
anything else

9
00:05:39,542 --> 00:06:34,565
what's that conservative 10 years the XML
parser swap the order of variables long ago
but redhound kept in the same because
compatibility nice yeah I don't think
there's any debate about the quality of 12
vs Red Hat software engineering team that
redhead is far superior to the canonical and
they are focused on her price is above
everything else than canonical's openly
stated their primary focus on consumer base
distros and it just so happens if people
like them for their service as well I don't
know we've got so far as of this last year
I've experienced more problems with 12 stuff
in the Enterprise related to Enterprise
Computing and architecture cloud-native than
I have with red headband haven't played with
you right now that's just been reported to
me so I'm going to make my own conclusions
are but I'm going to try this so this says
go use the volume

10
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:54,275
I will grab the sandwich Works going to grab
the image dynamically again and that was
failing for us earlier and we're going to do
it that way by 7 or so this is all the rest
of the stuff should work if you don't know
what this is you can go back and read about
it this is using each sale

11
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:59,396
and I'm going to move the terraforms to
state

12
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:05,229
and I'm going to go for it so is it
terraform

13
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:15,452
a fly right let's try it as redefine
redefine I broke something

14
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:22,479
amen don t f + 17 alright

15
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,394
which way did are doing all kinds of fun
things here

16
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:32,101
it should actually pull it down from the
internet

17
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:43,208
I wonder if it's going to update the DNS
entry to interesting to see

18
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:50,711
yeah it's falling down actually no that's
just making the volume

19
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,216
yeah that hangs we have a problem because
that's a permissions issue

20
00:07:55,216 --> 00:08:03,840
how did it nice and we saw the same
formations issue as before it does not
surprise me one bit

21
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:09,605
so we're going to try something new going to
drop me

22
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:15,697
pull up I saw images without the full
entirely actually and use the default fool

23
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:22,859
and see if that fixes it I'm not going to
spend a lot of time on this if this doesn't
work I'm going to abandon it

24
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:26,353
I'll try to do an apply again

25
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:36,836
and every time I do this it downloads the
image we have gotten manager and everything
to use the default volume locations
perfectly

26
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:43,934
so it could be that there's some
configuration that happens through terraform
that over rights with the default is

27
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:51,028
that could be what's happening we don't know
but I don't have a lot of patience for this
maybe got a different her

28
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,415
I mean I already exists with your idiot all
right

29
00:08:55,416 --> 00:09:02,406
it looks like it worked actually I know
maybe. Rent manager

30
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:10,317
I got to kill this to Leeds yes Suites

31
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:20,935
I think we got far enough on that one they
said that that other one that you just saw
by the way it is this is a Linux Mint that
we've been running

32
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,441
and we should probably turn it offturn it
off but anyway

33
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:31,752
I keep forgetting to eat with a route
manager you have to keep deleting the one in
pheasant work so we'll leave that up

34
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:40,059
I try to apply again after delete out to
terraform to state god dammit

35
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:47,057
at the same one again I had to fly

36
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,750
it happened Sarah

37
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:57,684
I'm trying to see if this if we fix the bug
we were having before without changing any
other variables

38
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:05,849
and then we can play around with a different
image San Jose tacos

39
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,861
are we go same problem permission denied
same exact problem

40
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,188
there's got to be something in here that
lets us talk to a differently

41
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,843
process exited while connected to blah

42
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:35,958
found in liver images no name of her storage
a real really

43
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:40,232
could not open permission denied

44
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:50,677
and here's how we know that that's a problem
because if we go

45
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:57,209
at me if you look at the configuration for
this

46
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:07,892
where's machine details you if we do

47
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:17,808
what's up is that nice so we going here we
see

48
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:26,812
where is the volume and trying to find

49
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:34,155
the volume Erica's liver images about to see
that

50
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:40,887
I just isn't it uses the images no problem
and the other one didn't use the images as
well

51
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:48,032
so if we go into this one I see the details

52
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:52,691
write this liver images of bunch of 2010

53
00:11:52,692 --> 00:12:00,499
for some reason terraform has a permission
block that does not exist

54
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,694
when you use a varmint varlet manager

55
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:12,786
and that's a terraform problem and I have a
feeling it's a telephone provider problem so

56
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:18,928
so that says Hangout

57
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:26,222
the verdict email in Gmail I forgot to

58
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:31,271
that says it's very rude

59
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:40,827
message Christine

60
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,270
I wonder why that is

61
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,995
that's interesting that's only chat send me
the provider is doing

62
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:08,507
it seems like it's by passing the settings
from the chemo we already fix these things

63
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,914
I fix them

64
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:31,330
because we didn't live in Kemah called and
they said group because liver right but this
would mean that they kiwi.com

65
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:38,003
is this these configurations

66
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:49,683
are not being used by terraform that was
said that would imply that terraform is not
using live birds that it's using something
else

67
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:59,090
that's that's what's happening yeah so

68
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:02,005
I asked a big deal it is a big deal maker

69
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:09,597
it is a big deal because that's it works
weight we were able to make it work no
problem using

70
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:12,704
the current configuration using the word
manager

71
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:25,027
but when we use terraform it still attempts
to create it is rude and he's there some
setting that's not getting conveyed that
tells it that we wanted to do

72
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:30,992
whatever you want to do it as as a specific
user

73
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,412
I mean we could do group equals live Birds

74
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,705
I'm just wondering where that setting comes
from

75
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:20,550
I don't know where that sitting comes from

76
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,859
where the group is live right there

77
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:34,227
Phoenix soccer group of birds

78
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,525
hey how are you

79
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:52,500
so we're going to church today I kind of
we're doing terraform right now so

80
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:58,133
hey we definitely need

81
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:07,546
this this is definitely the problem this is
really good information so I'm kind of
taking it in

82
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:19,070
when we use the manager it creates the disk
image with the proper permissions when we
created using terraform is bracelet with
incorrect for Missions

83
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,160
and

84
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:30,017
that seems to me like it's completely
ignoring chemo

85
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:34,689
and that would make sense because

86
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:44,885
it's provider libvirt and Liberty supposed
to run on top of chemo but this would seem
to imply that it's not doing that

87
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:48,553
so I need to read about the live bird
provider

88
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:54,275
then vert provider

89
00:16:54,277 --> 00:17:02,862
verts group volume permissions I don't want
to kill myself on this but

90
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:08,058
and I definitely want to read this

91
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:19,196
survive name source Master Akiko basically
my d

92

if not given default we be used

98
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:07,217

that

99
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:14,389
I finally got that is why I'm named guitar I
told you my dad

100
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:18,306
turn right before they make some of the
division

101
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:27,778
Saucy yeah I don't think this provides it
actually I don't think this looks to set
that uses usage

102
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,999
which makes me wonder if it's

103
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:41,927
are you ready hell

104
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:48,760
I don't think it's I don't think it's I
think it's a provider I think the providers
got a problem

105
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:51,838
yeah

106
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:16,641
I don't know I'm going to guess you just
here for a minute let's try that

107
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:39,201
alright so

108
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:51,473
are using it as is Ireland verts

109
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,495
I don't know if it's going to even let us do
that

110
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,829
french fry

111
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:17,589
. Thing

112
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,523
all right get rid of you

113
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,452
delete

114
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:05,556
I don't know what's going on it doesn't seem
happy now mostly because I

120
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,677
we can't afford to quit this

121
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:07,094
hey I'm just not it says there's only one
there

122
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:29,504
I know how to get rid of it

123
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:46,763
and is that time is really fucking weird
alright so

124
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:54,060
terraform and it

125
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:01,490
as a reason previous version of the verb
from the dependency locked file

126
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:07,615
the song Reserve what's 6.12

127
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:14,706
okay installing Rivard Southside for a
community providers blah

128
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:22,539
so terraform terraform

129
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:30,548
install it's wrong as a group

130
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,474
do you want Aaron

131
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:41,764
how do you do fellow kids

132
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,437
are we going to sell

133
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:04,752
ARG so it's 2:10 form

134
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:10,084
apply yeah it doesn't like it

135
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:20,108
I didn't think it did I was thinking to just
stab in the dark I don't have any hopes for
this phone to try anyway

136
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:23,331
so this is what it's doing

137
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:34,367
emulator this is because it's calling Kimo

138
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:45,022
I am thing you age of all trades reviews
here to Source service

139
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:55,595
whenever you change that I feel spice
Network addresses

140
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:04,479
volume default pool

141
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:13,016
electrifly size I think it's the same one as
the form

142
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:22,897
and download the thing again it's okay go
ahead and joke for just fighting with your
form again

143
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:36,846
I stopped her from though it's the provider
that's the problem and I I'm going back to
my original plan I think of not using the
number provider which is not production by
any means

144
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:41,345
and it keeps having these errors

145
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,335
which is

146
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:54,004
make the whole point of it is to be able to
pull up new stuff and if he can't do it
we're just fucked

147
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:02,612
I kind of feel like we need to use SSH
instead and go into another system and do it
I don't know how to test that though

148
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:07,192
I guess I could terraform on a client

149
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,826
what I was doing before so do we still have
our clan up

150
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,505
cast is not running

151
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:32,688
delete

152
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:44,041
and this one is so going out for that so
here's our what to do if you can fit
terraform on this

153
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:50,198
and didn't work that way

154
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:56,833
but then again then again it's a question
like how do you install terraform excetera
excetera

155
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:06,843
he said message to other things xcetera

156
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:18,030
yeah I don't even think I can SSH back to
the host I do not see

157
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,483
so much stuff on here with doctor

158
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:50,037
what is 7 Nike Air internet

159
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:58,157
there we go that's the the router which we
are

160
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:04,250
I meanI mean I think I could get

161
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:13,024
I think I think this actually serves is
around her let me try something

162
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:21,317
God dammit

163
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:30,670
92168 today at 1

164
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:41,374
I don't know what the password is that are
they try something

165
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:01,881
yep that works okay so

166
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:09,018
I have to do something I have to do

167
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:18,370
SSH coffee

168
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:29,858
ipid no identities found

169
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:37,141
ssh-keygen

170
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:43,721
no it's just a skeeter and Jess t e d 2 / 19

171
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:52,956
yes yes a passphrase copy of yes please

172
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,992
and Emmett

173
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,287
there we go

174
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:43,988
nice all right so that is all set up to have
passed for the phrase less stuff

175
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:50,296
hey the config language is the word

176
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:59,363
ACL next

177
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:14,125
all right so we are going to make a
connection to your so what I'm trying to do
here so this here is a pretend computer so
my goal here is to make this my computer now

178
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:23,144
into a multi CPU host

179
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:32,515
and we're going to see how that could
possibly work

180
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:36,849
so yeah so what's the strident

181
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:44,394
I mean this is all very experimental but I
kind of want to get it to work so

182
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:50,268
what the hell

183
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:02,546
alright so do to to to to to

184
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:21,931
all right so so so so yeah abms

185
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:38,208
we have it's a VM but this is going to be
the terraformed client so I'm going to try
something here I'm going to try to use
terraform as

186
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,989
using the SSH provider I don't know

187
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:54,020
I don't know anything about your phone but
I'll practically so I'm going to try to use
the more supported terraform provide SSH
provider and I'm going to try to bring up a
remote VM

188
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,643
on

189
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:07,285
on a remote system and the remote system
will be the one that I've allocated here so

190
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:16,266
yeah and we have to put that into DNS
probably but that's okay

191
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:18,252
so

192
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:28,271
so first things first we need to get
terraform installed so I have to remind
myself how to install terraform

193
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,362
at this one is gone

194
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:42,699
so in Sumter for me is the most modern
methods don't forget to exit back to refresh
and I have this song written

195
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:50,859
in a I believe I have this written in a in
the cave at Coronavirus

196
00:33:56,944 --> 00:34:04,394
this is no that's not it that's not it
cannot write it down

197
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:16,770
210 completion the night manager

198
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:34,344
oh I remember I remember I put it in my
install

199
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:46,207
carfi redaction Oklahoma, that's yeah

200
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:53,500
it's okay it's just RC so this is how we're
going to install Turf form

201
00:34:53,507 --> 00:35:00,496
now I can actually copy this over so I can
have sleepy

202
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:04,897
install terraform to vien

203
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:09,963
and it'll put over here so now it's over
here

204
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:17,622
a separate machine is on the virtual machine
but it's like having a separate machine so I
can run in Solitaire for over here

205
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,763
and I'm asking for my password just as we
should just password

206
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:26,473
and it'll go get everything

207
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:33,111
apparently the RICO does not have a release
file 08 with you

208
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:40,795
sudu and it starts listening small small app
update

209
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:48,863
right I don't have to get up doing it from
separate windows on purpose so that

210
00:35:48,864 --> 00:36:02,057
if you can kind of get a visual of it but
it's actually kind of hard to read so let's
not so I can just SSH to the VA now I'm on
that machine and I can just run install
terraform

211
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:05,616
my super secret password

212
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:17,664
does not have a release file I'm Tate unit
server

213
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:20,756
text refused

214
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:32,937
3 Debbie and like thing to do so see you

215
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:47,463
I think we need to put the the key tools and
all that stuff over here

216
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:52,200
is there a over here

217
00:36:57,222 --> 00:37:01,988
Studio apps update

218
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:13,331
bring me to Camp fighted I supposed to be
knighted

219
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,537
I finished half a quart in a
releaseaccording to a release

220
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:34,040
does not have a release file you know what
this this VM is too new

221
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:42,271
yeah I was afraid of that is Bahamas to new
it is not supported by a scorpion

222
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:48,807
okay well we're going to have to do another
weekend then

223
00:37:53,224 --> 00:38:00,460
I mean I don't know which one she is

224
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:06,454
I hope you always always use

225
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,637
weights

226
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:31,920
if that's that's the problem and it's just a
new God damn it well so much for that

227
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:42,479
is it going to have a super old version of
it and when I get to work so

228
00:38:45,712 --> 00:38:53,230
which means I'm pretty much just have to
stop

229
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:56,251
stop this guy and make a new one

230
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:05,148
it was me 20.04 it supposed to be ready to
support I don't understand it's not
supported

231
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:11,749
terraform is not supported on the sister on
this volume

232
00:39:13,974 --> 00:39:18,352
Estrella yeah because it's doing Ellis be
released us yes right

233
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:26,754
so this gives you Luna so this is it and if
you work on this one l s b

234
00:39:27,193 --> 00:39:31,478
this works so this is on her suit whatever

235
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:35,756
watch it was just crazy because I'm pretty
sure mine is newer

236
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:48,861
21 + 24 condemned sings Right Now app
install

237
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,984

238
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:07,321
oh wait wait wait

239
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,170
Subaru

240

have transports yeah

241
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:33,656
and it could be a missing app to phinizy
that's definitely true us right again

242
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:45,597
I got a lot farther it did in a release not
supported

243
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:50,381
hi Ronald what's that about

244
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:57,475
open source Securities Market Marketplace

245
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:05,593
so is it keeps going to see a nice very cool
thank you for posting that

246
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:20,912
obscure message Christian music adoration
details

247
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:28,143
from such a project can't be insecure late
is there for just a bite at fault when is
that happened

248
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:33,064
that's new that is a totally new thing

249
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:39,570
that's totally new Sheamus versus your point
six

250
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:47,346
how can you scan that does signature
checking release files I saw like the Glide

251
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:59,575
I like it for a lot of things yet and chrome
all of the configuration cache in Chrome is
people a lot of tackling files since we
don't have any information.

252
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:08,635
If itif it if we're kind of has on some of
these files in front of all the corned beef
with you I found enough for an operations of
you. First time I talk anymore

253
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:11,809
are we supposed to freshen your style

254
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:18,583
it was all going to raise only one he's my
setting figuration to acquire a lot of
Supervisors true

255
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:31,175
everybody's gonna love it this is what I was
talking about earlier or they just made a
fatal error or not we didn't used to be a
used to be a big warning and it can also be
allowed to be in Security in the sources

256
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:38,578
option allows for equals yes note that in
scary stories are strong

257
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:04,369
so I do to do

258
00:43:09,163 --> 00:43:12,753
you're honestly I ain't ya so I think it is

259
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:19,009
I think it's I think it's actually what I
understand it's is pretty bold release

260
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:22,101
this is Linux Mint

261
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:30,445
actually the only guy check in

262
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:50,185
mint 20 according to nevermind we need to do
you named Ashley

263
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:59,449
FF right now it seemed to matter you might
just fetch the binary

290
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:52,358
222

291
00:48:55,833 --> 00:49:01,615
yeah you can actually get that information
straight out the Jake you page if you wanted
it that way I did one of my way over there

292
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:04,621
the terraform

293
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:21,856
unzip terraform that's it terraform

294
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,258
second look at this one

295
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:43,252
of course I do who was the type Escape every
time

296
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:47,400
and you can always be trusted with remap and
caps lock

297
00:49:53,362 --> 00:50:01,217
I hate I just do all that here I guess it
did I guess it

298
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:09,806
all right

299
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,508

00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:12,442
why would I rate you can read my passlock
but you can't be guaranteed it's going to
work everywhere

307
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:22,001
I have caps lock ring remapped as well but
I've been using control arm bracket for 27
years so because it works everywhere

308
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,756
it doesn't require any remapping

309
00:51:24,705 --> 00:51:46,447
I do it. It doesn't work is if you have an
international keyboard and you can't hit it
easily and but I've heard I've now got three
people from here who said that they bought
American keyboards because of that for the
single purpose I didn't even know I found
him here and actually told me about it here
I thought I was really interested I would
never guess that's how I said thing that
people do

310
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:04,266
so much for the other shit that's way better

started down that path and I I threw it out
I don't want to use a fucking package
managers anyway screw that screw that

315
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:47,942

if we therefore delete member there early
early days you have to differ backspacing to
leave old farts are ever having to do that
you sent the map delete to do the right
thing backspace delete

I've never been able to hit this game I
don't know how people do most people hit it
by the way with the ring finger they don't
hit it with her pinky most of them. I've
seen people do it and they do it they do it
with the ring finger and that there like
always up there it's like fucking crazy I
would never do that and also pisses me off
that caps lock used to be a escape and then
the typewriter Nazis took over and they they
threw it out and it looks like there and
said nobody fucking uses caps lock nobody
uses caps lock except for Trump supporters

329
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:24,384

goben

360
00:59:04,261 --> 00:59:09,319
in talking about if somebody in here has
done that I guarantee you

361
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:20,570
and you know I'm talking about if you have
done that you know very much what I'm
talking about

362
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:27,586
got Gavin Gavin going to make Gavin

363
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:35,760
and there's a better way to do this by the
way there's a brown respect you can do and I
just don't remember it

364
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:37,431
if

365
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:45,264
and he shot the shouters cave and get
yourself a foot pedal for a scave

366
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:49,224
he was talking about going to say they were
going to get one

367
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:53,616
yeah they're going to get a foot pedal to
make himself a faster typer are they okay

368
00:59:55,879 --> 01:00:02,139
didn't drink Zoom Camp oh my God I'm already
terrified

369
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:10,183
and doing a terraform at the end of week 14
data engineering really well

370
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:13,832
I mean let's withhold judgment until I look
at it

371
01:00:15,855 --> 01:00:19,031
you should go for is it free

372
01:00:19,031 --> 01:00:29,114
go back do it for free and report to print
hopefully I got to know way too much of a G4
no mix now I wish I didn't know any

373
01:00:29,115 --> 01:00:34,135
can shih tzus are these folks I don't know
I've never heard what they've done

374
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:41,417
gcp Docker big picture data and SQL
terraform it sounds like they're going to
make you pay a lot of money to use the cloud

375
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:52,399
I would say go for it can't hurt extended
orchestration

376
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:54,988
what Kafka

377
01:00:56,674 --> 01:01:01,818
I would say go for it looks pretty good
they're doing everything in the cloud though

378
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:10,462
that's cool thank you for telling me about
that let's I hope that's successful I don't
have any idea I don't know who they are or
what they are

379
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:18,671
but and that's data stuff right so

380
01:01:19,714 --> 01:01:23,953
terraform hey it worked

381
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:32,649
it looks like I like this girl well did you
do the Boost

382
01:01:34,747 --> 01:01:42,745
when do we do stuff with doctor in the booth
to go try that Nationals this is my
recommendation

383
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:59,876
this is exactly how I learned everything
deep about bash I kid you not I am not being
facetious that is exactly how I learn about
Bremer expansion about completion with Dash
C

384
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:27,279
bookmarks the man page do that the Boost gym
and it's got some doctor in there that was
the first year I ever use Docker self and I
learned a lot about doctors that's in there
there are so many gems in the man page in
that get tutorial man page here's another
one is all so glad somebody told me about
this man get to tour this thing is all you
need

385
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:31,741
I'm swear to God it is so amazing

386
01:02:32,321 --> 01:02:37,476
that it is it's just it's amazing it is very
clear to read

387
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:41,756
yeah and it's right there been there for
everybody forever since it on time

388
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:50,282
I reckon is it so Sunday. Bring it

389
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:54,284
oh you read out something else nice

390
01:02:54,285 --> 01:03:05,771
yeah if you don't like you don't like Man
pages in The Terminal there's lots of other
ways and features are designed to be printed
of all that's that's no point are done in
Crofton drop off and now that dropped out of
me a sentence with off

391
01:03:07,013 --> 01:03:10,937
hey look terraform is over here

392
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:19,373
shall we get crazy should we get crazy I M
crazy now I am going to be crazy

393
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:26,246
crazy ish I'm at that I'm going to get crazy
you're crazy ish

394
01:03:26,778 --> 01:03:36,660
I am going to do terraform on my system from
a VM

395
01:03:37,187 --> 01:03:43,521
I guess and I'll do I'm going to use a
different provider I'm going to use an SSH
provider this time like ansible does

396
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:53,272
so let's try it shall we I am I am very
hopeful that this is going to work I really
am I am hopeful

397
01:03:57,013 --> 01:04:02,331
I kind of want to pull this down but then I
got to do my configuration stuff so I will
not

398
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,662
what are the mountains locally probably
could do that with an F A something

399
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:13,495
terraform Tri-State s c p

400
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:20,953
main TF2 VM colon so babe

401
01:04:21,997 --> 01:04:26,353
There She Blows main idea

402
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:35,125
I can Overlook some aspects yes I don't like
that

403
01:04:35,335 --> 01:04:42,559
there's also learning the Linux command line
because I'm at that yep that's free

404
01:04:43,595 --> 01:04:54,162
the Linux command line William shots

405
01:04:54,162 --> 01:04:59,910
actually I'll search for it and you go and
this is free

406
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:05,199
it's free errors you even the link for it

407
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,634
I am music

408
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:14,909
this is the link for a free pdf so it dated

409
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:22,111
but did you find it yeah no starch have to
pay that was free and if

410
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:25,771
and it's not free as in you stole it it's
free as in it's actually free

411
01:05:27,144 --> 01:05:47,709
different providers I am going to use a
different provider dye dye liver. You piece
of shit promoter hey look I know how to use
the eye because I learned via instead of
some shity new event or have been with all
our checks with plugins and I don't even
have to configure it I can just go over here
and be productive sort of

412
01:05:51,501 --> 01:05:58,053
yes and I'm shiting on everybody who's ever
not done that I'm sorry I don't mean to be
that mean

413
01:05:58,403 --> 01:06:06,081
sudo apt install them not them tiny which is
when it comes by default

414
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:22,155
hey look it just works and I know how to be
productive because I didn't burn shit into
my muscle memory that's not the default

415
01:06:22,155 --> 01:06:27,979
I'm going to run that shit in everybody's
face every time I do it because that is why
you do it

416
01:06:27,981 --> 01:06:44,249
everything that you customize in your muscle
memory that's away from the standard
reinstallation takes you that much farther
away for being productive on any system
anytime you're welcome to do it but I just
know that you're getting up productivity on
another system eventually

417
01:06:45,307 --> 01:06:51,083
and people that lets why the zMAX and U of M
and all kinds of god-awful shit

418
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,693
okay thanks V and the suffix M into it

419
01:06:56,573 --> 01:07:02,870

I could probably do it at is that over here

422
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:24,782
it depends over here got to can't remember
my thing on my commands

423
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:33,728
s r i have to it

424
01:07:33,728 --> 01:07:47,843
I carry him I spent two hours memorizing all
the new admin commands I learned it like
last year I can't right now it's worth
learning though I can't wait to do it again
in during the Boost I don't use it that much

425
01:07:47,845 --> 01:07:57,148
yeah it's actually pretty good you should
learn it all they can line all the colon
stuff to do with vin is Ed essentially

426
01:07:58,006 --> 01:08:04,326
preferred providers the Virgin kiss my ass

providers are

428
01:08:11,568 --> 01:08:17,276

431
01:08:34,538 --> 01:08:51,093
Nana has no business on them on any Unix
system ever is when the biggest sins and
whoever if I knew who was responsible for
putting Nano on Vin I would put them in my
permanent hate list

432
01:08:52,559 --> 01:09:06,517
why are you back on the ends after living in
the docker because I want to blow the shit
out of something and when you blow the shit
out of something and darker and blows the
shit out of your system not some pretend
system

433
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:10,238
Christian on them I meant do you know

434
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:23,516
is it also extended an coax that's what
that's what Dee is VI as usual mode of X in
fact used to be. Xrc if you're on a true VI
system the configuration files xrc not virc

keyboard Mac and install Natalie me what the
fuck

436
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:49,524
is it your manager for a letter hey hey mr.
tell me why are you there you got yours on
what what is the hands-down the best
terraform provider for traditional SSH only
access like I would do with ansible with an
agent

437
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:56,203
imagine they're already I'm seeing a ton of
Provisions oars oars

438
01:09:58,885 --> 01:10:01,206
what is the most common

439
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:07,010
provider for terraform besides

440
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:16,587
okay top 20 providers

441
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:25,422
electromotive Zach furniture how does that
get you something now

442
01:10:27,972 --> 01:10:32,957
hairless took of the top 20 top 20 terraform
providers

443
01:10:34,983 --> 01:10:40,005
gave you back sales and marketing from Jack
Farm

444
01:10:41,135 --> 01:10:47,328
your audio is breaking up is it my fault or
yours it was my fault I apologize

445
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:56,968
it could be because I'm running a VM already

446
01:10:57,648 --> 01:11:08,876
Turbo movie producers that is providers for
writers are essentially plugins that allowed
to inform the interaction with systems they
are either maintained by haschak or
third-party technology providers or
terrified of community members

447
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:15,918
that would be three things usually either
represents two things bad writing we will
forgive you JD Beck

448
01:11:17,097 --> 01:11:24,178
I gave you back the most popular terraform
provided by the number of installs on the
chair from registry

449
01:11:24,178 --> 01:11:29,201
of course popularity is always adoption is
9/10 right

450
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:40,523
mobile what's today I got you there are 8
utility providers no random archive local
external TLS DNS and http

451
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:50,762
6 public Cloud providers and I don't give a
shit three Hash a platform providers ball
Council telephone Club

452
01:11:51,302 --> 01:11:54,871
one container orchestration provider
kubernetes

453
01:11:55,554 --> 01:12:02,962
want to fight animation provider Helm and
one security Out Tantrum azure I'm always
I'm lurking

454
01:12:06,065 --> 01:12:13,069
I'm a mama mama mama mama mama I don't give
a shit about that stuff

455
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:24,849
that does not help me no

456
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:34,549
no provides constructs that intentionally to
nothing

457
01:12:41,072 --> 01:12:47,580
yeah we're not doing configuration
management we switch gears we're firing up
the VM so we're doing

458
01:12:50,562 --> 01:12:55,503
or firing of NVM on a system

459
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:58,915
on a hypervisor system

460
01:13:00,194 --> 01:13:14,532
but I don't even if it's possible there's a
goal I want to be able to run terraform
against the system that has an SSH
connection and then I want to run on that
system I want to cut the crap out of it and
strip shredded up and into pieces

461
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:22,948
can that be done I don't know I don't know
if it's even a thing that can be done

462
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:30,106
no resource no I don't want that

463
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:37,525
I thought of it I might actually do it
probably would have to like deliberate right

464
01:13:37,525 --> 01:13:43,531
but wait a second let's am I going to be
using the verb provider with a remote URL

465
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:51,327
what it when you met me at 20 minutes to do
I think it's going to have to do god dammit

466
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:54,742
I give it right back to where we started

467
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:07,046
shit from what grades on 610 servers

468
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:11,542
shit has a big deal at work work people are
working at work

469
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:19,848
I have a generator Hold Steady until the
inputs

470
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:28,362
God damn it I am not happy with this I
actually know what I'm feeling I know where
this is going

471
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:42,165
you know it's going to end up me being do is
give me to be firing up a bunch of yams and
putting my shirt on there by hand and
calling it a day and not using any kind of
automation that's what it's going to be
tomorrow tomorrow me to have to do that like
it's probably just give up and start that
now

472
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:47,911
great. Now I'm kind of frustrated because I
don't know what provider to use I'm not
using a fucking cloud provider for this

473
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:55,183
I can come to the father except I don't want
that overseas to Medical resources files

474
01:14:56,277 --> 01:15:04,083
so fast that we've been talking to some
about you the whole time God knows I love
that I love automation I'm trying to learn
the tools and people are using out there

475
01:15:04,304 --> 01:15:11,357
it was a while they're not using terraform
to provision your own on Prime stop there is
a form to provision the cloud service is
okay fine

476
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:17,195
fine I hear you saying that I hear you
saying it

477
01:15:20,373 --> 01:15:29,312
surprise especially my days just to provide
an interface with your form a national
program just for interfering with the
sisters which has provided does not exist

478
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:33,911
such as what

479
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:46,197
Google Beta official public policy forum
fault how this

480
01:15:46,652 --> 01:15:48,384
kill us

481
01:15:52,524 --> 01:16:01,439
all I want to do is what I want to do I want
to use terraform from a local Workstation

482
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:05,106
I hope this helps

483
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:14,964
what are you doing want to use Emily
12-point terraform at a remote server a
single remote server

484
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:21,009
and we want to shut that shit up want to
chop it up

485
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:37,376
I want to carve it up into 12 into 12 silver
so here's what I have I have one machine in
the case of virtual machine but we have one
machine your laptop with her and another
machine that has a hypervisor and SSH on it

486
01:16:38,564 --> 01:16:45,761
and I want this one to go to that machine
under SSH and chop it up

487
01:16:46,773 --> 01:17:05,638
and the more I think about what is required
for that to do that the more I realize it
depends on the hypervisor and the more I
realized it would probably be a little burnt
provider that would be running locally that
would be invoked over an SSH Connection in
which case I'm the same I'm at Square One
all over again

488
01:17:05,642 --> 01:17:11,649
so I'm I'm I'm pretty pretty raised for this
out

489
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,840
cuz I don't think you can use terraform

490
01:17:16,668 --> 01:17:21,396
I don't know but I don't think you can use
terraform to provision

491
01:17:21,397 --> 01:17:27,913
I need head here if you knows this I don't
think you could terraform to provision
on-prem stuff

492
01:17:27,913 --> 01:17:32,161
I know people that do I've heard him talk
about it before but

493
01:17:32,161 --> 01:17:37,690
what what is what's required to do that you
know

494
01:17:38,559 --> 01:17:59,175
I know of people who like stick a bunch of
servers in the corner and they put them on
the network and they manage them through
terraform and I just don't know how to do
that so I probably need to look I probably
I'm going to I'm rubber ducky in this with
y'all cuz I need to I can need to look
broader it's like

495
01:17:59,178 --> 01:18:10,204
how do I manage my on-prem servers with her
not manage how do I create

496
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:18,766
unfriend virtual machines with terraform for
doing it I just don't know how

497
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:23,517
cream private server to network in Nashua
terraform

498
01:18:23,784 --> 01:18:31,085
it's not on primitive it's in fucking Azure
create virtual machines whenever you want

499
01:18:31,085 --> 01:18:39,778
extract resources I think it's really hard
to do it on from my cloud gives you clean
API for interface versus versus ec2
instances

500
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:54,597
azeron from I know it's like fucking is the
first it to for Microsoft if you get
something like VMware proxmox that already
have a few guys to be consumed by terraform
that's you know what that makes sense okay
thanks for that Ronald

501
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:56,992
so so yeah

502
01:18:58,578 --> 01:19:08,852
I see were saying when you're proxmox that
consumes like the whole system right

503
01:19:09,557 --> 01:19:12,150
yeah

504
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:19,553
like to install an approximate endpoint it's
the proxmox is Fox News have a base image
that has to get since that gets installed

505
01:19:19,556 --> 01:19:20,430
I think this is dumb telling you know

506
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:27,836
I think I think that's I think this is
happening you know how many Open Force I
have

507
01:19:28,038 --> 01:19:35,396
I probably have enough power and open Fords
for like for Mac Minis that I can I can pop
up instead of having to do the whole server
thing

508
01:19:36,059 --> 01:19:38,802
I could probably get a couple tomorrow in
approximate sing

509
01:19:40,915 --> 01:19:46,543
actually I'm kind of on board with
approximately I didn't know I wasn't as I'm
bored about it before the way my unborn now

510
01:19:47,484 --> 01:20:01,421
I'm going to switch shift gears I'm you
can't do terraform unless you have a cloud
form is for forming clouds Cloud
configurations if you don't have a fucking
Cloud you can't use it

511
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:11,907
and I don't have a cloud on friends I have
to add my cloud have to have a cloud on
trans I can use terraform for it otherwise
it's all ansible in the bash crepes

512
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:28,030
yeah I'm starting to see the stupidity of my
ways now yeah the reason I keep bashing my
head against the wall with terraform is cuz
it's in the fucking name it's designed to be

513
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:33,031
or the ground where the cloud lives above
yeah

514
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:41,321
yeah they haven't released me with reading
Maybe

515
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:58,100
triggered violent address to Christian Court
reform memory done so I figure to a museum
of the following agricultural with bash or
Powershell

516
01:20:58,362 --> 01:21:03,731
bite your tongue implemented terraform Cloud
on front location

517
01:21:05,205 --> 01:21:08,722
say hi this is for an on-premise or 7th

518
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:15,714
I'm starting to see something that's really
obvious affect us so fucking obvious I'm
going to write it in big letters

519
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:27,995
angry mad

520
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:35,234
condemn it God damn it God dammit

521
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:47,761
shit and see comedy

522
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,717
rent

523
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:11,297
you can't have terraform

524
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:17,737
unless you have a Cloud 2 forum

525
01:22:19,963 --> 01:22:24,368
running late for stuff down after washing oh
that's nice

526
01:22:24,369 --> 01:22:31,761
fog computing the district Rock said of his
fellow sewing machines

527
01:22:31,761 --> 01:22:34,281
San Diego polka days

528
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:40,182
some miscellaneous makes able to run to the
arms act like pods

529
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:43,790
Hubert yeah I know if I can

530
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:52,175
yeah yeah I know that. Here's the problem
though I want to blow up your latest
installations so

531
01:22:52,175 --> 01:23:17,513
I actually need to maybe virtualize I was
headed rental I was going that path a
hundred percent I was like I don't need no
fucking viens I don't even want to learn
answer volunteer for all I want is
kubernetes on metal give me creative and
I'll put my keyboard in there and and then I
thought how am I going to test blowing up to
Brunetti's and developing for kubernetes

532
01:23:18,923 --> 01:23:26,474
by what doing a VM that's running kubernetes
within that have like four layers of
Inception

533
01:23:26,477 --> 01:23:30,254
I can't think too much

534
01:23:32,274 --> 01:23:35,312
it's so I think

535
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:51,174
I think I know what the answer is I think
yeah I feel like I feel like I just I can't
believe it or not I feel less frustration
right now because I know I believe strongly
that I know what went on to doing wrong

536
01:23:51,176 --> 01:23:55,398
what I'm doing wrong right now is

537
01:23:55,399 --> 01:24:02,957
I'm trying to use the cloud cloud
provisioning tool with no cloud and it
doesn't and it doesn't work

538
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:14,163
who did not kind of a Mac Mini SSH kind of
situation right yeah I know so

539
01:24:15,874 --> 01:24:18,902
but when I went to this is

540
01:24:20,342 --> 01:24:24,781
you can't use tf4 provisioning your private
Data Center

541
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:45,038
not without not without a web middlegrounds
none of us here who cheers on his big dumb
dumb realizations at lucido to I love it
like someone is coming after all the region
of a sack that's exactly what I think

542
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:47,959
self

543
01:24:49,538 --> 01:24:56,794
I think I think the answer is a level of
abstraction that's going to pay off in the
long run but be a pain in the ass in the
short run

544
01:24:57,587 --> 01:25:05,031
so I'm going to put forward my proposals for
going forward tonight and possibly another
time

545
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:11,643
my proposal is that we deploy

546
01:25:12,265 --> 01:25:20,398
proxmox or some Cloud solution for

547
01:25:20,603 --> 01:25:40,589
now on a single server and we have to get
this order in the problem with that is I was
going to deploy proxy I was going to cheat
this is this is my but I was really going to
cheat I was going to use my existing
streaming system pay I was going to use my
existing streaming system

548
01:25:40,592 --> 01:26:40,843
as my server and I was going to have a
remote that's what this is I was going to
have a remote Linux Mint box and use that as
my terraformed and then I was going to
provision the unused course they're all used
but on this computer from terraform but now
I realize that in order to do that I would
have to blow away my system and put whatever
the hypervisor in the minimum the minimum
hypervisor OS is on here cuz I have a
feeling proxmox can't just be it's not like
an agent you can just install it and you
think I have a feeling proxmox requires it
to be a base install image because it has to
have really low level access to to all of
the VM stuff I have a feeling I don't know
about to do the research on that if that's
true then the solution is not going to work
for my immediate need and it's going to send
me back down the path of doing the
networking

549
01:26:40,854 --> 01:27:28,922
and connecting up on the neck mean he's a
raspberry pies and everything and putting
proxmox on that at least a large percentage
of it some of some of it like my my actual
performance high-performance terminate stuff
will probably be on some of the systems will
be a different we don't have a a bare-metal
give her any situation going on and then
I'll have a number of other systems are
managed with proxmox and I kind of want to
see the different site where I can compare
performance between the two victory since I
have enough McNeese to do that I could just
say okay you know you ate Mac minis are are
in the cluster and you ate Mac minis are in
foxrock Supreme cluster and you ate or not
you're just a OS is in Hermitage independent
probably from an epic kind of situation I
have to take a break and come back that's
what we're going to do though

550
01:27:30,009 --> 01:27:31,952
I am minutes

551
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,130
all right

552
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:57,903
what the hell is that

553
01:32:19,512 --> 01:32:21,595
oh my God so stupid

554
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:30,261
so fucking stupid I can't say anything else
so I have to say

555
01:32:31,276 --> 01:32:37,837
it's so fucking stupid and doesn't even see
why all right fine back back to normal

556
01:32:45,182 --> 01:32:47,806
I just I can't I can't look I can't wake up

557
01:32:52,646 --> 01:32:58,071
let's see here other season proxmox research
so

558
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:03,066
how do I install proxmox let me do some
research

559
01:33:09,365 --> 01:33:16,452
and coloring I don't know if I want to go
down this this road right now

560
01:33:23,018 --> 01:33:29,210
it's her phone so it's not going to work and
some stuff I got to work so

561
01:33:31,364 --> 01:33:36,996
this this this the time this project is not
a thing

562
01:34:33,225 --> 01:34:37,410
that's why I do these things to learn the
hard way God knows I do

563
01:34:40,402 --> 01:34:46,012
I'm going to drop this let's check in the
stack yeah

564
01:34:46,365 --> 01:34:53,747
well in this case we're actually putting
more Tech I'm going to still use tear for
him I'm just going to have to do it in
proxmox

565
01:34:56,072 --> 01:35:01,443
yeah Randy proxmox asked me to change gears
here so

566
01:35:01,914 --> 01:35:09,251
I'm actually going to stop this one and move
on I may even

567
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:15,162
go grab a computer out of the closet and
provision in

568
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:24,277
just of the OS on it I don't think I can do
a network boot to get all that stuff so it
will take a peek

569
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:43,326
get Annette

570
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:53,578
I mean my field Labs I think are just as
important as the other ones cuz I want to
see people to see if they try it you can't
do it

571
01:36:00,953 --> 01:36:02,158
I

572
01:36:20,396 --> 01:36:21,595
when

573
01:36:23,678 --> 01:36:29,100
this is going to be I don't know if I want
to go all the way back to vagrant or not

574
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:23,732
uncle

575
01:38:15,467 --> 01:38:20,877
you must virtualization for six months to
see in this new tech gives you anxiety yeah

576
01:38:23,742 --> 01:38:28,583
this is how it has always been the one that
blew up

577
01:38:30,747 --> 01:38:35,847
what are the vagrant liver plug-in with work
now that we got the permissions problem
fixed

578
01:38:37,963 --> 01:38:42,984
we tried it with the telephone thing failed
but I wonder if they Grant Wood would work
now

579
01:38:44,387 --> 01:38:52,292
we haven't taken away before we leave this
let's go look at it reversing it when you
were here for that right

580
01:39:04,934 --> 01:39:06,653
generic YouTube

581
01:39:14,493 --> 01:39:18,988
yeah we already tried that we try that we
spend a whole night on that and then it blew
up

582
01:39:19,523 --> 01:39:28,647
is also openstack yet people were saying hey
where you going to use openstack vs. proxmox
I actually think openstack is probably

583
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:37,249
amor macrostax is a ton

584
01:39:37,784 --> 01:39:47,936
yes yeah yeah I'm a sex one with a few other
people talking about all the different ones
let's do try bigger and see what's up though

585
01:39:49,773 --> 01:40:03,072
it's okay maybe for a super stubborn. Don't
forget to install the plug-in provider
created box is too big and plug-in install
megabox ad

586
01:40:03,074 --> 01:40:10,075
this Maxi might work now that we got the
other problem done when that be ironic

587
01:40:10,494 --> 01:40:18,198
now Nexus and mainstream enough I would love
it though what is going to work

588
01:40:20,434 --> 01:40:22,260
is it raining

589
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,163
and generic

590
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,773
oh God

591
01:41:04,088 --> 01:41:30,877
and if we can get bigger to work as as old
and busted is it is it's it's the target
hits the target solution for what I'm trying
to do it is the calm that says this is it
Target use case is for software developers
to recreate application development
environments quickly using their local films
that is exactly what vegan is for it just
happens to be fucking broken refused chemo
and Katie m

592
01:41:30,883 --> 01:41:32,573
so

593
01:41:34,252 --> 01:41:40,294
yeah I'm going to go over to work that's it
thinks that that one exists it actually
doesn't

594
01:41:44,606 --> 01:41:49,452
if any boxes severe holyshit

595
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:53,204
that that's the first time that has happened

596
01:41:58,522 --> 01:42:04,150
defaults not created virtualbox 08 do we
tell it Levert

597
01:42:05,072 --> 01:42:12,794
shit the hell are blood or other one I think
I might have

598
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:18,743
now what to do what the hell

599
01:42:23,301 --> 01:42:25,811
what is an ad

600
01:42:42,834 --> 01:42:48,071
shit it works oh my god it worked

601
01:42:49,676 --> 01:42:56,608
if fucking worked we did it it works

602
01:42:57,906 --> 01:43:05,213
okay so yeah but this is this is not the
sciquest this is the original Quest

603
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:16,408
this is the original Quest so this means I
got to read bring I got to bring vagrant
back the problem with our original Quest

604
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:24,508
this is not the quest yeah

605
01:43:31,266 --> 01:43:36,042
wait what is it called

606
01:43:38,652 --> 01:43:42,354
the machine with the name was not found
configure for bigger environment

607
01:43:45,867 --> 01:43:47,828
we have to up at first

608
01:43:58,868 --> 01:44:01,246
I've never I don't know how to do any of
this

609
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:09,158
I don't want to fall through so much with
her

610
01:44:10,081 --> 01:44:17,347
do you do the bigger file or do you have to
have to be in my configuration in my head is
like totally fucked up now

611
01:44:17,879 --> 01:44:21,346
all right well first things first let's
actually turn this guy off

612
01:44:24,688 --> 01:44:29,182
as I don't need you anymore

613
01:44:35,017 --> 01:44:36,773
I already added that

614
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:45,907
yeah I knew that the first time I ever do is
let me know you make me bring you back a lot
of memories here that we did that already
fitted

615
01:44:50,038 --> 01:44:52,215
I could have swore I had in that

616
01:44:56,695 --> 01:45:10,622
you know I did that it and I deleted it I'll
prove it I can look at the gate if they get
history here and I'll show you that it was
here we'd deleted it you know why yeah we
deleted it because it added it all that shit
moment I saw that remember

617
01:45:10,952 --> 01:45:17,367
they were added all that shit when he saw
that I have it in the history also I'm
something

618
01:45:23,623 --> 01:45:33,345
yeah it was there we ripped it out because
we we decided to abandon bigger so now we're
like look at it bigger and again and
considering some things

619
01:45:34,096 --> 01:45:35,822
so

620
01:45:44,951 --> 01:45:49,324
yeah I know I know what to do I know with
you we did it already

621
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,114
but I also want to make sure that we have
the completion of stuff in there

622
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:06,943
this is something I'm getting confused I
can't believe we're going back to this one I
really can't

623
01:46:11,426 --> 01:46:14,285
I had to change my topic are

624
01:46:15,342 --> 01:46:19,774
I can't believe this is back on the table
this is insane

625
01:46:33,165 --> 01:46:40,500
live good morning

626
01:46:54,573 --> 01:47:03,750
well this is been the week of vagrant

627
01:47:04,246 --> 01:47:12,123
give him chemo and terraform ansible for
sure as soon as I can will win week

628
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:21,877
alright so to get this week and

629
01:47:21,088 --> 01:47:27,009
how do you get to Fig I just need to open
this real quick and go show you that I did
it

630
01:47:27,489 --> 01:47:29,523
Ashley Simms. Files

631
01:47:34,235 --> 01:47:40,277
and I go look on the history on the. The
pastor see

632
01:47:41,658 --> 01:47:48,920
history remove vagrant and never use it
again and Miguel

633
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:52,810
if vagrant then do this shit

634
01:47:57,219 --> 01:47:59,576
just so fucking horrible

635
01:48:04,297 --> 01:48:06,384
I guess we're running it back

636
01:49:50,862 --> 01:49:52,652
satlink

637
01:50:06,928 --> 01:50:11,906
all right this is back up spackle I've
apparently

638
01:50:14,954 --> 01:50:17,084
I forgot steam but yeah

639
01:50:18,325 --> 01:50:23,649
and we do need to do the export I didn't see
that in there I could have sworn we had that
in there

640
01:50:31,239 --> 01:50:46,144
I at one point when I think happened yeah I
think I know what happened I had that
environment variable in here and that never
got committed and then I just wrote the
whole thing out before I got a chance to
committed so we'll go ahead and add it back

641
01:50:46,372 --> 01:50:53,943
fragrance I know specifically because I was
looking forward

642
01:50:59,804 --> 01:51:06,350
in I might have to kill this again today
nevermind

643
01:51:09,408 --> 01:51:11,933
I'm just going to bite me in the ass God
damn it

644
01:51:19,366 --> 01:51:22,728
I make sure it works so we do vagrant

645
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:36,818
fragrance up it is versabox again

646
01:51:37,317 --> 01:51:43,723
sharing provision for you do you have every
right fragrant destroy

647
01:51:50,012 --> 01:51:54,054
vagrants a fisherman

648
01:51:55,136 --> 01:52:02,636
I just want to see if it uses every time box
by default in alavert provider has not found
that was that was requested

649
01:52:03,645 --> 01:52:10,782
back machine places in front of that exist
it was not a big there's no bigger than a
provider

650
01:52:11,723 --> 01:52:17,971
so this is the problem we had before part of
it I guess about the following providers

651
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:27,808
that's how he got his at work I don't ever
had at it at 8 when I can really pulling up
old stuff now

652
01:52:28,317 --> 01:52:32,294
there it is Megan plug-in I think we deleted
all of it

653
01:52:49,612 --> 01:52:54,293
I was a mistake I should have done that

654
01:52:55,745 --> 01:53:01,042
I did give up on dig right like completely
in and it just it works

655
01:53:01,877 --> 01:53:04,336
with virtualbox and now I

656
01:53:06,809 --> 01:53:09,917
it brought up a vagrant no problem

657
01:53:11,774 --> 01:53:17,876
everything is just said that was not a very
good looking and yet I just started the
other one so now I'm really freaking
confused

658
01:53:18,609 --> 01:53:24,587
so yeah

659
01:53:33,934 --> 01:53:41,795
I tried to just okay so we actually fixed we
fixed liver today

660
01:53:43,185 --> 01:53:56,425
we fix it we got it to work the way it's
supposed to work there's a number of
configurations it's all documented in The
Zed and chunky help us figure that out

661
01:53:56,758 --> 01:54:03,073
and it was it's not working so and then
we'll try to use the telephone it doesn't
work because the same

662
01:54:03,236 --> 01:54:07,814
volume permission problem and

663
01:54:08,585 --> 01:54:14,476
so that that didn't work it was like okay
it's it's it's the big one it's a provider
for living room

664
01:54:14,748 --> 01:54:26,066
I mean I mean liver provider and then I
thought well maybe the thing that we fix
maybe the permissions are that we fixed
actually fixed the the vagrant issue

665
01:54:26,839 --> 01:54:33,538
and so then we did vagrant

666
01:54:34,448 --> 01:54:43,392
and I started in it it it works it seems it
was it guys from the cigarettes

667
01:54:44,387 --> 01:54:51,818
oh I don't know liver cannot be found

668
01:54:53,224 --> 01:54:56,757
Tubac the machine default music provider
they exist

669
01:54:57,085 --> 01:55:02,385
some of that same problem now and now we're
back to

670
01:55:02,385 --> 01:55:06,521
hey but I think was the original problem the
reason why you deleted the ignorant

671
01:55:06,523 --> 01:55:29,637
all over again so it didn't fix anything you
can't use vagrant with chemo and the birds
it's like as a known bug and I feel like
we're back where we started from again I
think I thought I had a moment of Hope
because it was showing it was working but

672
01:55:29,638 --> 01:55:35,767
I believe the reason for that was

673
01:55:36,415 --> 01:55:41,615
only because hair wholesale

674
01:55:43,875 --> 01:55:49,179
unset Big Red

675
01:55:51,776 --> 01:55:54,907
is it default provider or something

676
01:55:56,752 --> 01:56:04,348
is all the stuff with liver with a major
issues you can say that all you want it
doesn't mean it works

677
01:56:04,618 --> 01:56:08,202
it works for your bullshit setup

678
01:56:09,813 --> 01:56:22,315
yeah I was actually able to get it work
today after I talk to somebody else so I
mean after we wasted all that time the other
day I'm super happy to talk to somebody who
was going on so

679
01:56:22,315 --> 01:56:40,241
and cuz we got it working right away and and
that was that give me that made me happy
that we may be able designated by the way
experienced all the same problems that I had
talked about every single one every single
one that's why they knew how to fix it so
yeah that's awesome I'm happy for you you
probably weren't using a

680
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:55,985
the fact the fact that matter is the person
who had this are the reported it
successfully and helped us get it fixed
successfully had had this problem on a bun
to and it was because it was about to say so

681
01:56:56,503 --> 01:57:09,462
yeah I'm happy for you think that's awesome
you didn't help me the other day though and
somebody else figure it out so I don't know
man explained that to me mister hundred
million dollars sold company for

682
01:57:12,636 --> 01:57:14,207
it works for me

683
01:57:14,769 --> 01:57:23,865
we spent eight hours trying to fix it and
you couldn't fix it here and they fix it in
like an hour so I call bullshit

684
01:57:27,005 --> 01:57:35,144
so app you can you tell you what Bruce in
the pudding so so this is a thing

685
01:57:36,672 --> 01:57:43,126
that we didn't get working I'm also brand
new to the whole thing so that's always
something it's there

686
01:57:44,583 --> 01:57:49,728
I don't give a shit about your receipts dude
we just want explanations at work

687
01:57:51,983 --> 01:57:58,506
and we're all in there is trying to go there
trying to figure it out I appreciate your
help it's not like I'm going to run grateful
I just

688
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:06,951
I don't like ever hearing it works on my
computer I don't know what your problem is
do you not know not to say that ever

689
01:58:08,855 --> 01:58:20,394
I know it works but I'm trying to tell you
if they got it to work exactly with the way
we needed to without anything different so

690
01:58:21,055 --> 01:58:47,990
no you didn't you didn't you didn't want
suggest that I changed the group delivered
which fixed it not once and that's fine we
were experimenting we were going through
things but and I appreciate your help again
I said I appreciate your help but giving me
that works on my computer is going to piss
me off every time and you're going to get a
little going to get a little shit back for
me if you say that shit to me ever and that
goes for everybody else to sorry works for
me mad I know what to tell you

691
01:58:51,351 --> 01:59:10,012
no I had to do my drinking nothing to do
that now you didn't tell me that I have all
the chat logs you really want me to pull
them up absolutely didn't complete it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter it works
okay I was just move on is he really don't
know what to do it right

692
01:59:10,396 --> 01:59:19,257
if you don't if you don't know what to tell
me they don't do they say it works for me I
don't know the problems just keep looking
you know what I mean

693
01:59:19,258 --> 01:59:25,133
I don't want to hear it from this asshole
for awhile by 4/4 minute

694
01:59:25,133 --> 01:59:32,729
come back when you're useful God damn all
right so

695
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:42,337
I'm going to try I'm going to try to see if
we can get this Bennett make everything
working again

696
01:59:42,337 --> 01:59:50,328
and we'll go ahead and go for it the

697
01:59:50,726 --> 02:00:01,303
the difference is that we have delivered
that works now so I want to make sure we can
isolate that down and see if we can get that
I covered I don't know

698
02:00:01,304 --> 02:00:17,878
what's your favorite commands are some
minutes remind myself of all those again I
don't want to use vagrant I really don't
it's an old technology I almost don't want
to do it and just keep focusing on the PM's
and go with it go that route and we'll get
that going

699
02:00:17,995 --> 02:00:20,512
so

700
02:00:20,512 --> 02:00:27,351
let's see what is the shopping list commands
what's the one that showed us all her stuff
that sub

701
02:00:27,351 --> 02:00:33,595
Xbox right vagrant box

702
02:00:33,595 --> 02:00:36,521
list there you go

703
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:46,774
so there we got it actually it actually it
actually opened up a generic live this is
something that happened today

704
02:00:47,496 --> 02:00:55,455
and I don't believe this is the one that got
that weed that we brought up I don't know
though I'm going to go ahead and try that

705
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:57,673
yeah how are you going to be

706
02:00:57,674 --> 02:01:04,474
so if you do bigger than it again in scratch
to have an event file I think that's
probably going to do

707
02:01:04,475 --> 02:01:09,027
yeah vagrant file

708
02:01:09,028 --> 02:01:14,514
this file was free empty

709
02:01:14,514 --> 02:01:22,173
it doesn't have much in there let's go ahead
and start from scratch actually I think I
want to be really careful with is to make
sure that the boxes

710
02:01:21,072 --> 02:01:36,630
the boxes that are listed as being up are
not boxes that were brought up using the
working virt-manager situation and I think
that that's might be the case I think that
this might have been the one that was popped
up by the ignorant that maybe the one that
was started

711
02:01:37,098 --> 02:01:43,269
so so that might be the way to go on that

712
02:01:46,858 --> 02:01:50,068
it's let's do that let's go for it let's say

713
02:01:53,413 --> 02:01:55,794
that's what I think we need to delete all of
these

714
02:01:57,921 --> 02:02:07,486
I think it's interesting that the four-door
one came up as well let's let's let's try to
destroy them all from being her and see
what's up so we can do a clean vagrant and
thing completely

715
02:02:07,498 --> 02:02:09,545
ignorant destroy

716
02:02:14,352 --> 02:02:20,562
it's not fair. I don't know how to do this
so I'm going to figure this out just to do
the completion for you

717
02:02:21,113 --> 02:02:27,877
do you have the second do you have to have a
referral for it right I'm not created

718
02:02:28,498 --> 02:02:35,752
I remember how to do bigger and it deletes
improve for the virtualbox yeah I know I
don't know how to do that

719
02:02:35,753 --> 02:02:40,799
I don't know. We'll figure it out yes

720
02:02:45,602 --> 02:02:51,552
regular destroy I need to be discreet about
it

721
02:02:54,085 --> 02:03:01,224
straight sh give me the institutions that
directory or the ones that are in the
directory

722
02:03:01,847 --> 02:03:04,605
that makes me wonder where the others went
and where they came from

723
02:03:08,775 --> 02:03:20,218
is it safe to say I don't know but it is
safe to say that it's listing boxes that are
there that we're not under big
responsibility before right I think that's
what's happening

724
02:03:20,449 --> 02:03:27,329
it's box vagrant box and if so is it remove

725
02:03:27,839 --> 02:03:34,136
okay good I want to do it explicitly though

726
02:03:34,899 --> 02:03:39,521
and you have a VM pray to just the box
images

727
02:03:40,879 --> 02:03:49,408
okay so we have this is for staying so this
only shows two boxes under management from
virtualbox I mean from

728
02:03:49,409 --> 02:03:56,175
I see that that removed it with the liver
provider which you know what makes me wonder
so

729
02:03:56,175 --> 02:04:03,420
if we try the other one and see

730
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:10,577
that's supposed to leave select a single
provider to remove with provider

731
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:21,125
access multiple providers multiple providers
interesting

732
02:04:21,769 --> 02:04:26,453
I did not know that help me find

733
02:04:33,053 --> 02:04:42,532
all right so now we probably going to have
problems adding it because of the whole
limbert setup even though I added the plugin
for Lindbergh

734
02:04:42,533 --> 02:04:47,218
so we're going to check that vagrant

735
02:04:49,866 --> 02:04:56,024
box list they're not sell boxes okay

736
02:04:56,025 --> 02:05:02,640
fragrant Vox ad oops

737
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:07,048
I'll try we need to give it a provider right

738
02:05:08,226 --> 02:05:15,724
I see a man with a bigger box add name URL
or path

739
02:05:15,727 --> 02:05:22,980
okay let's do a generic 20 2010 actually

740
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:28,458
yeah this is where we get the list of them
right

741
02:05:28,722 --> 02:05:31,600
generic

742
02:05:31,605 --> 02:05:41,790
I want to we look that up on it we look that
up I was like going back a couple days but
this is what we did we looked it up on the
big old list of images of ignorant provides

743
02:05:43,163 --> 02:05:51,101
and I want to has multiple providers nice
let's see if we can get this when they work

744
02:05:51,102 --> 02:05:57,527
so far so good cross your fingers please
work please work

745
02:05:57,527 --> 02:06:03,249
the plugins installed you know what the plug
and you know what the plug-in went in

746
02:06:03,667 --> 02:06:11,657
I think we had an error I don't remember I
didn't document it but I think we're in an
area with a plug-in going in so

747
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:22,208
it I'm going to shop

748
02:06:24,703 --> 02:06:27,054
heckling comparing the check Sons

749
02:06:30,312 --> 02:06:55,095
this is like really good news because we
think we got this is already way too far
then we got before that is fantastic
holyshit the vagrant thing is probably going
to work for us like everybody says now that
we got the liver thing fixed so I don't
commands that it's cool no taking system I
have to do it because if I don't do it on
fucking die

750
02:06:56,202 --> 02:07:26,690
I make so many mistakes in as everybody has
noticed I make that I have to go back and
look at things in Creative boxing just
images yes boxers are images of bn's are are
bringing something up right so now we can
actually do a vagrant file and there's
nothing in this thing this is just as it was
in the net this was just a bigger than that
the only thing we changed it is the box type
that was the it wouldn't put Internet
working on there or anything such as ansible

751
02:07:26,696 --> 02:07:30,064
so let's go for this and

752
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:38,114
I think we should be able to do a leg up and
weight using the maker of pilots in our
current directory I think I'm going to try
it

753
02:07:38,372 --> 02:08:38,874
and if it brings up a system we are golden
and and then I'll be using bacon for all
this shit which means I'll have to learn
Ruby as long as it works this is the reason
for this the main reason for this is because
we we just concluded that terraform cannot
be used without a cloud which means you have
to have a cloud and even if the cloud is
local like you know openstack or proxmox or
whatever you have to make your own probably
some way to cheat and get around that but
that is the that is the you know, and
supported way of using to reform which makes
sense that's what is at school it's her form
is for provisioning servers in the cloud or
machines in the club that's what it's for
it's always been that so trying to make it
do it on a single machine only if the
machine look like a cloud is kind of
cheating and not really well supported
vagrant does that well when it works it just
was not working

754
02:08:38,887 --> 02:08:48,145
play because of the liver problem which the
all the bugs that we found and then they
were confirmed and then we got to fix today
so now that we have lived behaving

755
02:08:48,440 --> 02:09:04,215
properly I think we might be off and running
on vagrant and Bighorn is the most common
thing you're going to hear about on YouTube
because it's so fucking old I don't
particularly like writing Ruby files for my
configurations but and but if it works so be
it

756
02:09:04,972 --> 02:09:12,019
importing the bass box that looks like it
did virtualbox instead of the bird

757
02:09:12,019 --> 02:09:18,890
is it because I didn't provision it live God
damn it brushing machine yet

758
02:09:19,607 --> 02:09:22,568
I thought we had liver down there

759
02:09:22,568 --> 02:09:49,479
yeah it is if it if it's using the
virtualbox provider and it and I can't get
liver to work within 10 minutes then because
this was supposed to be a test to see if
Lambert worked I'm just going to stick with
her Suboxone, and I don't give a shit and
that's what Tony while I was betting that I
was going to end up doing in the end anyway
and I think he was right or they were right
I don't really even know who people so let's
try that sostre

760
02:09:51,049 --> 02:10:08,732
I did is because I unset that environment
variable fuck I think it is oh you know what
it was damn it I had to unset the
environment variable in order to get to
destroy and down file and down stuff to work
the command to work because it was it was
saying it wasn't a valid provider and now

761
02:10:08,734 --> 02:10:18,797
now we need to bring it back up so I'm going
to have to pull out all this all that stuff
back down again so that's good just practice
big wrench

762
02:10:18,798 --> 02:10:22,822
list snacks with Megan Fox list right

763
02:10:22,823 --> 02:10:30,007
it's going to say Virgil box there at pulled
both down though why did it pull both of
them down

764
02:10:30,008 --> 02:10:35,891
oh wait a second

765
02:10:37,531 --> 02:10:40,354
wait a second

766
02:10:45,941 --> 02:10:51,826
I'm thinking here I am I am

767
02:10:59,632 --> 02:11:01,216
covid grants

768
02:11:07,481 --> 02:11:13,730
who is it called I got them and I remember
Pastor C

769
02:11:14,898 --> 02:11:21,878
a lighter make sure they can file does not
contain virtualbox search for imprimatur

770
02:11:22,123 --> 02:11:27,721
give me Waze best yes I'm trying to commute
I turn it up to a boy

771
02:11:28,405 --> 02:11:33,279
I want to know is there a way to prove to
put that specifically in your neighborhood
file

772
02:11:37,851 --> 02:11:43,887
yes it does yep it definitely does

773
02:11:45,352 --> 02:11:50,234
what are using apparently you can

774
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:55,160
wasn't saving up provider is it be ended up
earlier if you beat up for better

775
02:11:58,825 --> 02:12:04,435
configuration at work public I don't know
anything about bigger files so

776
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:14,929
there it is if a Korean provider Russian box
to do BB

777
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:24,763
I agree cuz true or Suboxone Resorts cutie
with a booty machine no allowed to take and
pick her up for a provider

778
02:12:25,307 --> 02:12:28,019
and it works against a folder or no

779
02:12:30,412 --> 02:12:38,519
I don't know if it's just the environment
variable or not I want to look for something
more precise besides environment variable

780
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:44,843
their default provider

781
02:12:58,202 --> 02:13:01,256
why isn't it doing it if have vagrant

782
02:13:20,284 --> 02:13:25,301
is there okay so why

783
02:13:27,054 --> 02:13:32,890
hey Grinch amazing running

784
02:13:33,133 --> 02:13:36,042
covers of ice for sale.

785
02:13:36,144 --> 02:13:44,645
I tried to tell you make a note make a call
to shut down for Thalia can you bring her to
spend any case we start again step in the
mirror up vagrant

786
02:13:45,106 --> 02:13:52,196
halt it's a great social 7 p.m.

787
02:13:52,196 --> 02:13:56,199
is that it being provider Levert you found
it

788
02:13:56,311 --> 02:14:02,622
thank you so much for finding that I just
wanted to fuck around with environment stuff

789
02:14:03,348 --> 02:14:11,029
you know I asked people to say they would
namespace is kubernetes I hated I hate it

790
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:21,288
I like to set it explicitly in Miami files
because I don't I don't I don't want to
accidentally get over it and buy something
you know

791
02:14:21,513 --> 02:14:27,979
yeah I need to go to the whole crate bigger
thing I do I do I'm just I'm kind of rushing
this little bit

792
02:14:32,043 --> 02:14:39,517
hey G provider that led verts so

793
02:14:48,369 --> 02:14:51,152
let's try this

794
02:14:51,988 --> 02:14:56,612
I mean if if this works it shouldn't give a
shit about the variable

795
02:14:56,613 --> 02:15:02,445
and it should blow up honestly I got to be
prepared for the Super Bowl

796
02:15:12,202 --> 02:15:16,772
I don't I don't necessarily

797
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:22,089
I mean I can see arguments both ways okay
using that allows you to

798
02:15:20,722 --> 02:15:30,677
using that allows you to change a virtual
machine and have things come up it's
probably more innocent people can swap out
their provider I get it but but

799
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:43,714
while I'm doing this right now I want to be
absolutely sure what I'm dealing with and
their RC is still went for virtualbox so
that would mean it's not reading the Big
File

800
02:15:45,846 --> 02:15:52,593
War or it's not raining my environment
variable either one is not working

801
02:15:53,245 --> 02:15:59,220
it's a ruby scope it's a Rubik's Cube for
very variable

802
02:16:03,236 --> 02:16:07,120
yeah yes

803
02:16:09,678 --> 02:16:17,596
look I just the environment variable is not
being recognized I type something wrong
perhaps but it's not working

804
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:23,638
so vagrant underscore defaults underscore
provider

805
02:16:24,857 --> 02:16:31,147
equals live Bird right when I do vagrant up

806
02:16:31,927 --> 02:16:37,932
if that's true then I should be able to

807
02:16:39,891 --> 02:16:42,331
haven't pick up that one

808
02:16:43,432 --> 02:16:53,869
and it says it says it's doing your default
virtualbox it doesn't just fucking ignores
environment variable I completely straight
up and doors it what am I missing

809
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:07,655
yeah so yeah configured I see you have it
outside

810
02:17:08,967 --> 02:17:14,184
options for live at making provider to live
holy shit

811
02:17:15,883 --> 02:17:19,233
live liver driver KVM

812
02:17:19,839 --> 02:17:25,817
oh my God this looks phenomenal kind of wish
I had this years ago this is awesome

813
02:17:25,818 --> 02:17:33,211
I've been trying to find this stuff is this
in the big stuff and example boxes try to do
this again

814
02:17:36,874 --> 02:18:30,266
yeah yeah I see it here too it's in here
here's a here's the thing okay so let me
know before I dismiss this the suggestion to
use the environment variable is not working
and I need to be absolutely sure that
because I'm seeing documentation of this as
well that that's the way you should be able
to do it and it's to me it's not working so
we already know they got tons of bugs
because we see them documented from the
other stuff we were doing so what I want to
do is I'm going to try to be you no more
meticulous on this because I want to isolate
the bugs and things at work and if things
don't work so because if we're going to be
dealing with maker and it's going to be a
pain in the ass and I want to make sure it's
documented that the first thing is this this
does not work I can copy and paste that
right now I can put it into environment
variable and I can do vagrant up

815
02:18:30,273 --> 02:19:15,344
and it will big bring up a little box
instead of anything else is that because
that particular one has already been
admitted that way I don't know if we take me
to get rid of the vagrant file here and you
vagrant an it you know what is that do
bigger fountain place so you do make and we
do this give you the base box and everything
I mean what's not even fucking touch the
thing and see what it does if this doesn't
work I want to know why okay so and so far
it hasn't you know I against the expert that
file just some people believe me export
bigger files was literally copied and
pasted. Vagrant

816
02:19:15,347 --> 02:19:22,988
I do have a dog bacon file but this

817
02:19:23,737 --> 02:19:26,225
all right let's just delete that shit

818
02:19:26,310 --> 02:19:44,016
you change the provider on the fly it would
take Francis is the vagrant file well I
didn't see anything to Patron file so all
right let's start with 00 they renewed
srf.ch vagrant let's remove the vagrant file

819
02:19:44,018 --> 02:19:58,845
vagrant file and and then we have we have no
vagrant here and then let's actually just
like do the thing really removing I don't
think we need to do that though right

820
02:19:58,846 --> 02:20:00,217
the vagrant list it'll say

821
02:20:04,046 --> 02:20:10,500
we only have liver and liver box which is
fine and then we have

822
02:20:13,776 --> 02:20:15,634
what was it was the other thing

823
02:20:17,915 --> 02:20:23,805
we need to remove some of the stuff is so

824
02:20:24,542 --> 02:20:29,360
let's do I think it's status right

825
02:20:29,950 --> 02:20:41,304
environment or Target machine is required to
run this command Undertaker in it so it
doesn't know about anything right now let's
I'm a manager and make sure nothing is
running that's kicking Flex with it

826
02:20:41,306 --> 02:20:55,130
because I sometimes wonder nope nothing is
there so there is no virtual machines
running right now as far as we know so then
I mean virtualbox might have some suffering
but I wouldn't know

827
02:20:56,851 --> 02:21:01,306
so let's do this let's do they rent in it

828
02:21:03,594 --> 02:21:10,147
and the question is do I need to put the
provider in here I probably do right

829
02:21:11,017 --> 02:21:36,287
and just to be sure let's do provider equals
Lindbergh and see I don't I don't know if
that's a thing well as try that doesn't like
it that last time so Mason has been placed
in your right a and that has there's no
other vagrant files in here there's nothing
here go ahead and exit the Box again

830
02:21:36,626 --> 02:21:42,009
expert that says copy and paste from the
site to go back to the site over here

831
02:21:42,892 --> 02:21:45,223
and if we do

832
02:21:45,896 --> 02:21:53,966
so there's to call my sister this next to
the test that we did we did that very test
and it didn't work

833
02:21:54,566 --> 02:22:00,906
and let's try I mean we did it we did a
basic one

834
02:22:00,907 --> 02:22:07,525
vagrant file let's change this to be it was
a generic

835
02:22:07,603 --> 02:22:11,727
generic Ubuntu 2010

836
02:22:11,989 --> 02:22:18,137
all right so now we have generic a bunch of
2010 and we should be able to pick her up

837
02:22:18,715 --> 02:22:26,691
and that she grabbed it now this is the air
we got before it didn't know about live
Birds

838
02:22:26,691 --> 02:22:34,644
and this is where the question comes in do
we have to install the plugin

839
02:22:34,982 --> 02:22:45,800
please use a provider that exists so this
does not know about the plug in for Levert

840
02:22:46,447 --> 02:22:53,148
and I don't know how to make it know about
the plug-in if so

841
02:22:53,448 --> 02:22:57,994
is this this look at that the document hair
that you guys had

842
02:22:58,439 --> 02:23:05,659
for the telephone when I get to take a peek
yeah I think the closest one to

843
02:23:05,734 --> 02:23:12,881
alright so here we go ahead and projects
created locally

844
02:23:13,230 --> 02:23:21,709
provider options should work through this
supposed to cut a few versus conditions

845
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:24,548
how long are things

846
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:33,879
this is a fake this fuss this rice just wife

847
02:23:33,879 --> 02:23:40,422
Sheriff's if you they could fix if you said
there they have

848
02:23:40,422 --> 02:23:48,032
provider do I got that phone number for that
other

849
02:23:48,033 --> 02:23:53,046
but I don't there's there is no could not be
found right

850
02:23:57,702 --> 02:24:03,455
I wonder if I have to do another stanza for
it or something

851
02:24:03,455 --> 02:24:08,576
we need to read about how to get delivered
support and I don't think it's in here

852
02:24:08,577 --> 02:24:12,060
they might be in the top. Let me go look

853
02:24:13,633 --> 02:24:21,596
vagrant Levert provider all right I'll see
if I can get it installed and read it all

854
02:24:21,672 --> 02:24:26,140
take a look at open issues in container
image

855
02:24:26,140 --> 02:24:31,882
Ken around compatibility with Ruby runtime
environment is full stream

856
02:24:31,882 --> 02:24:38,466
you're connecting to remote system Lynn
Ranch Nashville

857
02:24:38,467 --> 02:24:46,198
what I want to use a container when they
Point container images to use the vagrant

858
02:24:46,698 --> 02:24:53,418
that's weird crane image it's possible to
find

859
02:24:53,906 --> 02:25:00,710
a function for example vagrants Alberta
Falls your eye vagrants the birds

860
02:25:01,119 --> 02:25:05,052
why would you put it in a Docker container I
can't imagine doing that

861
02:25:13,481 --> 02:25:18,115
I don't understand why they would do that
extending the doctor images additional
Varian plugins

862
02:25:20,514 --> 02:25:40,552
human liver install if you're planning
revenge on your local system for
instructions use this note because you're
starting to because you start using vagrant
liver please make sure your liver and kidney
installation is working correctly and you're
able to create chemo and KVM type person
machines with yes and I have already done
that

863
02:25:40,855 --> 02:25:43,940
I did that yet

864
02:25:44,261 --> 02:25:55,628
next year must have Negron installed vagrant
Levert supports vagrant to it should also be
easier things just are the current list of
test versions

865
02:25:57,035 --> 02:26:03,127
vagrant version

866
02:26:05,307 --> 02:26:08,372
2.2 and 90k

867
02:26:09,499 --> 02:26:15,364
I need to make you need to make sure you
have all the bill dependencies installing a
bigger the verge

868
02:26:16,198 --> 02:26:21,823
we have all these we have them cuz we did
this already

869
02:26:22,135 --> 02:26:28,943
open Susie Arch Linux Fedora possible
problems with plugin installation on Linux

870
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:36,963
he's had problems with building NOCO girl
which was the problem we had

871
02:26:38,111 --> 02:26:41,198
we didn't have that problem with that
specific problem

872
02:26:43,570 --> 02:26:49,183
bigger than beds dnf downloads bigger
project preparation add box

873
02:26:51,018 --> 02:26:54,230
I still don't see the instructions for how
to install it

874
02:26:54,617 --> 02:27:00,575
it doesn't say how to install the bug in
there's like a million different things and
none of them

875
02:27:00,976 --> 02:27:07,779
there it is okay Pac-Man fedora

876
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:20,346
you're now ready to install using vagrant
plugin installation methods for some of the
citruses you need to figure out a
configuration works

877
02:27:21,503 --> 02:27:26,887
extreme okay so let's try this I I did this
already

878
02:27:27,117 --> 02:27:34,494
and apparently that only installs it into
your current directory I think that's what
we lost I think that's what we lost

879
02:27:36,303 --> 02:27:44,199
I think since those are in a local that
vagrant directory I think that's what's
going on see a brownie brownie

880
02:27:44,199 --> 02:27:51,802
I'm going to be going to bed here soon
pretty soon hey I got in it got no girls
find oh my God that makes me happy

881
02:27:51,802 --> 02:27:56,552
I did not get that last time it did not get
it as well

882
02:28:02,403 --> 02:28:05,528
so it's going to get that

883
02:28:11,689 --> 02:28:18,482
building native extensions that makes me
wonder what it's doing my fans on Tanya
though so she'll probably be okay

884
02:28:26,806 --> 02:28:29,535
yep yep

885
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:41,446
if there we go this is this is

886
02:28:47,675 --> 02:28:51,348
I think this is the problem we had last time

887
02:28:52,846 --> 02:29:03,479
I don't know maybe not

888
02:29:03,497 --> 02:29:13,615
vagrant failed to properly resolved required
dependencies users can call me because I
miss configure plug installation or Transit
reports are blah blah blah

889
02:29:13,615 --> 02:29:16,005
at daycare

890
02:29:16,005 --> 02:29:22,155
I'm never going to hit Sarasota sell brand
new stuff yeah I threw myself into terraform
ansible

891
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:26,718
Isabel vagrant KVM and chemo all in 3 days

892
02:29:29,386 --> 02:29:30,923
this is what you get

893
02:29:32,884 --> 02:29:40,142
this is got a ton of dependencies that are
not being satisfied this is typical you know
stuff

894
02:29:42,146 --> 02:29:49,078
it so we can have to do maybe in an hour

895
02:29:52,939 --> 02:30:09,303
I don't understand this thing but if I'll
damage published in use contains the entire
tool chain required to reinstall bigger than
a plug-in NES dependencies and this is the
default behavior of anytime when you plug it
isn't so it's means it should be possible to
use a simple from saving a speaker to
install additional plugins

896
02:30:10,973 --> 02:30:19,720
I just don't make any sense I this looks
like they they bundled up all of their stuff

897
02:30:23,673 --> 02:30:30,414
all of their dependencies into a Docker
container to avoid all the Ruby shit so that
it would just work

898
02:30:30,895 --> 02:30:36,006
yeah I see what they're doing here huh

899
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:41,606
interesting

900
02:30:42,927 --> 02:31:01,250
you think remember to Ken around
compatibility with rubber runtime
environment this is part of the Upstream
Baker insulation and the library
dependencies that this project requires to
communicate with the birds in other words
because Ruby is a piece of shit that this is
a darker image build that there is a darker
image build and publish

901
02:31:02,315 --> 02:31:32,993
RV dumps in a ravine virtual a mess with
their doing yeah like my van and I know I
actually this this is probably the best way
to do this yeah yeah this should allow you
to text you vagrant with liquor in Liberty
without needed to deal with it compatibility
issues though you may need to extend the
image Briones should you make additional
used to the plug-in that this is your fault
and you should change the filter change
required to build this all the big red lid
and it's dependencies

902
02:31:33,672 --> 02:31:56,088
there is also a smaller image publish with
the slim side effects if you just need
vagrant Laverne and don't need to assign
ages to plug is your moment if you are
connecting to a remote system Levert You may
omit Dash Envy Mountain behind some
distribution specialist actually sounds like
a good idea now that I know I don't know
about darker look better

903
02:31:57,154 --> 02:32:02,019
so dr. Pol yeah

904
02:32:03,301 --> 02:32:09,723
running the image the real the real Slim
vagrant

905
02:32:09,723 --> 02:32:21,957
to get the image of the most recent released
a couple of LED vagrant they they can't live
vert vagrant Dash The Verge latest that if
you want the very latest you can get Edge

906
02:32:22,452 --> 02:32:27,597
running the image shit

907
02:32:30,418 --> 02:32:34,372
indoctrinate Atlas rise

908
02:32:34,372 --> 02:32:41,944
I really want to try this I think this I
think this is a better way to go because I
understand doctor now that are in and I
think it's probably going to go

909
02:32:43,971 --> 02:32:47,011
where's the doctor in June with religious

910
02:32:48,309 --> 02:32:54,126
yeah it's really not dashed privilege said
yeah I'm guessing

911
02:32:54,128 --> 02:32:57,641
yeah it's it has to be able to get yeah

912
02:32:57,641 --> 02:33:02,632
I don't know if that's safe but you know
it's probably nice

913
02:33:03,199 --> 02:33:24,029
because I would rather you look I don't mind
if they keep maintaining ancient Ruby ship
as long as they give us containerized
version and they did so I feel like I should
that's the right thing for me to do is use
that probably also don't have to walk around
with all this stuff either if we do this I
mean I mean for completion I guess I have to
do that but

914
02:33:26,242 --> 02:33:31,366
so if they Grant

915
02:33:37,505 --> 02:33:45,170
vagrant Okay so

916
02:33:46,175 --> 02:33:50,368
I can do this thing where I automatically to
text Megan

917
02:33:54,395 --> 02:34:02,184
now it go I'm going to put this in the in
Star this is something that might be able to

918
02:34:00,907 --> 02:34:09,929
assistant that I might be able to get behind
and not be upset about because it is old
Tech I don't mind learning a little Ruby
again

919
02:34:13,434 --> 02:34:14,742
you know

920
02:34:16,005 --> 02:34:23,956
ain't nobody covered privileged in their in
their their stuff here I would have guessed
they would have put that shocks for a lift
chair but they didn't

921
02:34:24,233 --> 02:34:31,077
so I don't know vagrant

922
02:34:33,366 --> 02:34:37,757
so

923
02:34:38,380 --> 02:35:01,158
I like Ruby I just yeah I like it I just
feel like it's kind of running out of time
and interpret language is always have the
problem like the one we just head I mean you
don't have this problem with you even with
her for me real good and if you have a nose
no problem as soon as we got to the binary
no Estetica compiled by owners are so much
easier to work with

924
02:35:01,262 --> 02:35:07,823
Arabic number for the I know I love a ruby
Community I love the Ruby Community even
especially months

925
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:14,708
oh I know I agree the Ruby Community has
been

926
02:35:16,439 --> 02:35:22,395
has been hands-down the most accommodating
friendliest Community I've ever had to work
with

927
02:35:22,679 --> 02:35:34,968
yep and they do not stand officer really I
think it's set by Matsumoto when he's just
so amazing I really like the really
Community I always have it's it's just that
you know

928
02:35:35,853 --> 02:35:42,139
I don't know ISO vagrant

929
02:35:42,512 --> 02:35:44,078
list

930
02:35:53,944 --> 02:36:01,406
you met him here is Mormonism I don't know
if he's still as it was in 2017 was

931
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:06,597
yeah I tried a little bit once not in person
but

932
02:36:08,481 --> 02:36:16,411
yeah and really inspired me to make the pro
classes pregnant make turn pro in a ruby

933
02:36:16,671 --> 02:36:20,893
I just read something I wanted you to say
yes exactly

934
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:55,137
yeah he's he's I like him a lot like a
moment I try to get everybody to do it in
fact it was because of Ruby that I found out
about second life because I was looking for
a way to do virtual meet-ups because I
didn't want to travel an hour to go to
really meet up let me tell that story before
but I meant that that's what I did and I
went to my first the first thing I ever went
to in Second Life was a ruby meet up because
I was learning about how to code in but I
like we was so much better than python

935
02:36:55,141 --> 02:36:59,651
I do but I haven't written it in a long time

936
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:11,757
you know it's funny because rust has a lot
of syntax elements from premature all the
languages including Ruby and I think it's
interesting

937
02:37:12,185 --> 02:37:16,019
every computer with my Honda out wasn't the
same space

938
02:37:16,019 --> 02:37:23,350
if it was a really great for making demands
specific languages is it was Fantastic Four
that still is

939
02:37:28,078 --> 02:37:32,604
head-to-head I don't think it was
head-to-head with my phone the different
thing

940
02:37:32,858 --> 02:37:39,671
it is Ruby and pearl knotheads a little bit
but that was always they were always
complementary of each other

941
02:37:39,672 --> 02:37:57,447
did it in LA I really hope I don't explode
that stuff really wasn't even python python
has been better at at doing C+ at disguising
sea than any other language so far that's
what makes python famous my phone is really
good at hiding

942
02:37:57,798 --> 02:38:02,611
at hiding C plus plus

943
02:38:02,611 --> 02:38:09,332
it's it's okay like it's all the credit when
it's actually see plus plus that's get
that's that that's the reason that people
use it

944
02:38:09,333 --> 02:38:19,083
are bees in action of pro which is why the
entire Metasploit database is designed to
use it

945
02:38:19,089 --> 02:38:28,404
so maybe I should just accept it I'll try to
sell this to vagrant

946
02:38:28,404 --> 02:38:31,979
box list

947
02:38:32,767 --> 02:38:39,385
vagrants I don't know now that her can't
find it still

948
02:38:39,385 --> 02:38:46,226
so I can't find it doesn't make any sense
Prince Road am that's why

949
02:38:57,727 --> 02:39:05,708
Batman there we go oh my God it did it oh my
god it worked

950
02:39:06,027 --> 02:39:09,765
it's only a holy cow wait a second

951
02:39:13,378 --> 02:39:19,038
filter initialize KVM device or resource
busy why

952
02:39:24,385 --> 02:39:31,656
Isis Mysteries was cuz it was it was already
something there they already have something
there

953
02:39:45,397 --> 02:39:46,655
wow

954
02:39:59,407 --> 02:40:04,229
can I see resource busy kuna system nice
resource busy

955
02:40:06,132 --> 02:40:07,928
I wouldn't say that

956
02:40:12,917 --> 02:40:15,305
oh man we're getting so close

957
02:40:20,482 --> 02:40:22,702
we're definitely getting closer

958
02:40:33,712 --> 02:40:40,098
oh like if he was going to crash I sent it
to this a crash

959
02:40:41,006 --> 02:40:47,760
I see how it is all the stuff's going away I
was VM stuff is like killing it

960
02:40:53,389 --> 02:41:04,694
python wants to be a one obvious way but it
really isn't us too bad it never really
filled that promise

961
02:41:05,432 --> 02:41:10,502
everything was all I was in between Ruby was
a pearl anyway you want kind of thing

962
02:41:12,179 --> 02:41:19,739
to win out yep I think it might I think
versus Wolverine so much just fucking works

963
02:41:20,253 --> 02:41:21,862
you know

964
02:41:24,412 --> 02:41:32,076
yeah I got to get shit done and I got to do
it tomorrow so I don't have time to fuck
around with all this other stuff

965
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:43,205
order me to yeah yes it absolutely was
completely agree especially accessories and
get ours as cool as they were don't make any
sense

966
02:41:44,856 --> 02:41:49,066
yeah it's it's this is not good I probably
have to reboot at this point

967
02:41:49,936 --> 02:41:56,918
Caribbean Caribbean failed 16 device
resource midi how is the device resource
busy there's no resource

968
02:41:57,855 --> 02:41:59,700
I don't see

969
02:42:08,101 --> 02:42:14,470
I don't know I just don't see I just don't
see it working

970
02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:33,541
I mean let's be realistic the only reason I
was using liver and cute chemo is because
it's so fucking fast it's so much faster
than than than virtualbox

971
02:42:35,644 --> 02:42:38,513
the versabox just works you know

972
02:42:43,830 --> 02:42:49,178
that's actually prove that I bought this is
Kelly so

973
02:42:50,170 --> 02:42:52,974
I'm going to I'm going to rip it out again

974
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:59,203
yeah I don't know

975
02:43:03,644 --> 02:43:07,057
initiate number to fill out your eye

976
02:43:15,303 --> 02:43:22,293
wait what are the fault that aren't your
ideas because we

977
02:43:20,718 --> 02:43:24,518
aren't your ID because you didn't Define
delivered about your eye

978
02:43:29,102 --> 02:43:31,935
oh no that's just an extended right

979
02:43:38,841 --> 02:43:42,413
out let's get rid of this guy

980
02:43:59,199 --> 02:44:00,539
exact

981
02:44:09,514 --> 02:44:13,637
hey current up and got passed a bunch of
other things besides problems

982
02:44:17,314 --> 02:44:23,180
give me some more information now is it
today starting to Maine

983
02:44:30,953 --> 02:44:35,292
can you call to the main crate with flags
failed

984
02:44:36,181 --> 02:44:43,856
turn alarm processing look connected to
monitor I have to give him create failed
device or resource busy

985
02:44:44,604 --> 02:44:47,763
how to initialize KVM device or resource
busy

986
02:44:48,839 --> 02:44:57,597
that's it that's it that's an air coming
from the chemo system so if we had actually
tried to build it with you or system it
would have failed to

987
02:45:05,544 --> 02:45:16,122
so that's what they were saying hey make
sure we're so we can keep him if we hit this
is one of the commands from Kimmy for come
up for critics up by the fall from the from
ground up

988
02:45:16,547 --> 02:45:23,390
is Deb to him already yeah I don't know what
it is but we got to figure out

989
02:45:23,391 --> 02:45:29,181
what it what is it that's what it'll tell
you it is it is it l s i o

990
02:45:37,799 --> 02:45:40,841
it's so if I think it right

991
02:45:50,222 --> 02:45:55,129
he's poor. We might need a rebate I could
have fought this Colonel and pretty bad

992
02:45:55,709 --> 02:46:00,856
I need to find out what's got that what's
got that baby I'm open already yeah

993
02:46:06,647 --> 02:46:09,668
many could be any number of things in this
point

994
02:46:17,366 --> 02:46:19,811
how to

995
02:46:30,934 --> 02:46:38,695
how can I just give him with the number
Andrews I think that might be a part of the
two is it doesn't have privileged access we
might have to add dash dash privilege to
Hood

996
02:46:38,695 --> 02:46:46,028
if I want to create a group C KVM it could
be many Cube it could be

997
02:46:47,834 --> 02:46:54,579
I need you to season by default so I don't
know any chance you have to be home by a
group.

998
02:47:15,424 --> 02:47:19,176
2 2 2 2 2 2

999
02:47:47,585 --> 02:47:51,865
is there is a member of the KVM in living
room group

1000
02:47:52,182 --> 02:47:58,575
wait I don't think I know because it ran the
process is 1,000

1001
02:47:58,961 --> 02:48:05,871
and so is Francis a thousandis 1000 / the
KVM group you need to launch a new shell

1002
02:48:08,247 --> 02:48:11,176
why do we have to ask ourselves a KVM rube

1003
02:48:12,818 --> 02:48:20,037
this is real it's real I'm going to your
user session buy snow cone machines

1004
02:48:22,540 --> 02:48:24,109
shaver missions

1005
02:48:32,959 --> 02:48:38,547
arkadium yeah that's the problem I'm not in
the KVM group

1006
02:48:39,585 --> 02:48:47,407
I don't think I am nope I don't remember me

1007
02:48:48,199 --> 02:48:52,194
having it be an issue though but obviously
it is

1008
02:48:56,913 --> 02:48:59,433
kbm is your name

1009
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:17,811
I whoops this is an old one

1010

know I love it it's beautiful it's a doggy

1052
02:56:13,384 --> 02:56:16,781
so it's so well done

1053
02:56:20,643 --> 02:56:25,426
because it sucks in

1054
02:56:29,460 --> 02:56:36,933
it is it's really pretty oh I like how it
builds up the edges that's really cool

make s a border without a border

1056
02:56:54,027 --> 02:56:59,652
I understand what this is says I tried to
say we were salvation of symbiosis

1057
02:56:59,834 --> 02:57:02,417
a certain logic abmd

1058
02:57:03,066 --> 02:57:08,031
security sensor that makes me wonder if
virtualbox is using it already

1059
02:57:08,262 --> 02:57:12,198
is there any is there any way we're supposed
to be running right now

1060
02:57:16,460 --> 02:57:24,096
disturbing you when you doing is my I sent a
picture

1061
02:57:25,475 --> 02:57:27,756
it looks like it's embedded in there

1062
02:57:28,314 --> 02:57:38,076
it doesn't look at does it does not look
like pain at all it looks like a painting I
mean I mean photograph

1063
02:57:39,547 --> 02:57:41,588
at the photograph I love it

1064
02:57:46,196 --> 02:57:53,987
the kernel modules running yeah okay so I
got to try something here

1065
02:57:54,667 --> 02:57:56,234
yeah there we go

1066
02:58:01,716 --> 02:58:09,549
Deputy warnings are there any other night

1067
02:58:12,084 --> 02:58:17,337
did you see that one oh yeah

1068
02:58:25,709 --> 02:58:29,475
let's do something crazy

1069
02:58:29,839 --> 02:58:48,892
it's about my computer is totally dying cuz
Papa less you see how it's completely
shutting out because it sucks it sucks its
populace has got all kinds of bugs the
latest one especially I can't even see what
I'm typing in my desktop manager anymore
thank God for us keys

1070
02:58:51,251 --> 02:58:55,857
it's it's absolute shit I cannot wait to get
back to Mint

1071
02:58:59,789 --> 02:59:04,724
sitting here going to go ahead and do that
and

1072
02:59:08,245 --> 02:59:16,044
I'll go for it hey there

1073
02:59:16,618 --> 02:59:20,217
so we're going to do

1074
02:59:21,845 --> 02:59:28,771
I mean I got versabox on here are we going
over some blocks

1075
02:59:29,844 --> 02:59:35,957
I think the new version has been released oh
goodie

1076
02:59:41,271 --> 02:59:47,985
okay that we that Library current default is
running

1077
02:59:48,581 --> 02:59:52,162
it says it's running that's why I couldn't
start the other one

1078
02:59:53,217 --> 02:59:57,673
and it might be because it still thinks it's
trying to use the other one I don't know you
know

1079
03:00:02,749 --> 03:00:04,539
so

1080
03:00:18,153 --> 03:00:19,978
yeah

1081
03:00:20,675 --> 03:00:26,994
I kind of want to turn it off and just make
a new distro from scratch and I wouldn't
have all these problems

1082
03:00:27,140 --> 03:00:33,474
I think that might be what's causing the
problem yeah

1083
03:00:37,308 --> 03:00:44,333
I need to turn this thing off I can't even
turn it off apparently I had a login though

1084
03:00:48,632 --> 03:00:54,795
machine pause

1085
03:00:59,448 --> 03:01:06,273
front for us Pokemon eating I can make an
operating system

1086
03:01:06,273 --> 03:01:14,194
thanks for the vote of confidence yeah I'm

1087
03:01:14,820 --> 03:01:34,564
you know what I threw myself at a ton of
stuff this weekend and all it is destroying
my ego is so much I learned so much but but
yeah I'm going to try to learn ansible
terraform vagrant Kimu KVM

1088
03:01:34,566 --> 03:01:38,870
all in 4 days 3 days

1089
03:01:42,072 --> 03:01:58,596
classy handful of people have been telling
me to travel to me as well I mean but at
least I'll know what people talk about when
you know when they yell at me when I yell
and I say hey I don't know I'm doing any say
Hey try this tonight okay

1090
03:01:59,939 --> 03:02:05,371
I feel confident this is going to work
slightlyis it going to work slightly better
so far so good

1091
03:02:07,143 --> 03:02:14,259
so far that was it I feel sort of hopeful

1092
03:02:15,221 --> 03:02:21,213
I feel sort of hopeful holy shit there were
no errors

1093
03:02:23,857 --> 03:02:26,239
oh my God

1094
03:02:34,534 --> 03:02:38,382
this is why I like being hackers

1095
03:02:39,909 --> 03:02:56,221
the greatest Hair Force you can do and be
good at almost everything is just a minute I
know you could you can't do it anymore. I
know what this feels like it's like you feel
like you have your handling something in
there like 10 other things that are like

1096
03:02:58,176 --> 03:03:02,692
it's super Annoying It's too I know exactly
what you're saying

1097
03:03:02,808 --> 03:03:06,539
it was just a habit

1098
03:03:09,013 --> 03:03:13,297
got you know what you was going to suck as
it's going to actually

1099
03:03:13,589 --> 03:03:18,171
well no because it did appendices is still
needed to resolve those so

1100
03:03:18,692 --> 03:03:22,404
now I just now just makes you want to try
Tara from a law firm

1101
03:03:23,608 --> 03:03:27,661
yeah it's so different I mean you kind of
knew what was going on before

1102
03:03:27,942 --> 03:03:41,683
it's something like that I work on cars to
Nike I remember my Dodge Dart when I knew
where the alternator was I can just take it
out and replace it when I go to bed and I
have no fucking idea to take my whole engine
and part cuz technology people

1103
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:47,835
if you want I can do it I can do it if
Chewbacca can do it I can do it

1104
03:03:53,240 --> 03:03:59,179
I mean I feel like there's something here
now I don't know what it is

1105
03:03:59,179 --> 03:04:03,707
I don't know how to get to it it's there

1106
03:04:06,567 --> 03:04:10,713
make a list how's it going polar

1107
03:04:20,222 --> 03:04:21,750
anyway

1108
03:04:27,208 --> 03:04:29,576
let's do this let's do

1109
03:04:33,487 --> 03:04:38,639
isn't there like an SSH think there is yes
yes there is

1110
03:04:39,482 --> 03:04:45,864
hey look look it connected holyshit

1111
03:04:47,655 --> 03:04:55,528
I have an Ubuntu 2010 suit machine I want to
learn kubernetes so do I

1112
03:04:57,016 --> 03:05:01,854
I really do and I've been doing it for a
Full Bucket year I still want to learn it

1113
03:05:02,545 --> 03:05:10,778
I've already know the different kinds of
mine Orchestra ways can I say that I know it
even though I've been a professional. It
adds up to you man

1114
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:35,207
you can view it's like I have a level 1
knowledge of it whenever I think you just
need to be precise right it's working so so
our vagrant lab Tunes up tends to be the
late in the winter most of the shit I need
to do is falls under vagrant and that saves
me from you I will still use terraform and
all that stuff but not before this

1115
03:05:36,026 --> 03:05:51,748
and this shit what you bring up yet and
bring up with him whatever you want to drink
whenever you can do straight that's probably
right in that a dance of operations to the
bank and file which you can do you get a
chance of a provision so that I can file

1116
03:05:51,749 --> 03:06:01,025
and this apparently figuring is old Tech
though so I don't know how much to invest in
this but I definitely am going to

1117
03:06:04,261 --> 03:06:10,992
I guess I could with two machines in this
rain what was the one there's like a vagrant
command it's like

1118
03:06:11,029 --> 03:06:18,253
realist the status

1119
03:06:18,499 --> 03:06:23,387
shit oh I know why

1120
03:06:25,980 --> 03:06:29,117
even if he's not going to work

1121
03:06:31,914 --> 03:06:34,524
is there a movie

1122
03:06:36,708 --> 03:06:41,342
vagrants

1123
03:06:46,199 --> 03:06:49,095
. was that their private

1124
03:06:51,655 --> 03:06:56,760
call find a whole bunch of proficient 5 on
ya

1125
03:06:57,122 --> 03:07:05,013
because I had no idea what they've done you
know you got to be able to talk about it

1126
03:07:06,420 --> 03:07:09,580
I can tell you exactly what I know about
Mega right now

1127
03:07:10,223 --> 03:07:25,925
I was just very much we can say can I say am
I do I know if bacon yes enough to bring up
a single thing you know and that's not
sufficient for most purposes

1128
03:07:27,107 --> 03:07:30,589
I I need to I need the ansible this guy big
time

1129
03:07:31,416 --> 03:07:35,452
I do I do I delete all this other shit in
here my life

1130
03:07:36,267 --> 03:07:39,816
and if you are very angry confirms his
version

1131
03:07:40,459 --> 03:08:04,003
I'm not going to comment below for complete
reference to go to Doc's are they grown up
everything and Val envirocars inbox is there
two boxes I am kind of glad that this that I
don't have to throw back or not completely
because of this is definitely the tool that
was targeted at what I wanted to do which is
pull up a bunch of GM's in order to software
testing noguchi drewski

1132
03:08:04,005 --> 03:08:09,818
God..... Disable automatic updating

1133
03:08:12,148 --> 03:08:19,799
next steps vagrant provisioning did you find
me link you're such a good person thank you
for that

1134
03:08:23,226 --> 03:08:26,060
if they going to file

1135
03:08:30,272 --> 03:08:38,217
trainer box configure the box with ansible

1136
03:08:39,573 --> 03:08:42,211
yeah I'm going to include that in here

1137
03:08:46,365 --> 03:08:54,010
no plugins no plugins no plugins plugins can
die

1138
03:08:57,114 --> 03:08:58,782
nope

1139
03:09:12,781 --> 03:09:14,663
all right

1140
03:09:42,886 --> 03:09:54,112
you're not really like about that when I ran
that it told me exactly what the error was
every other time I tried to do this I had no
idea what the other was

1141
03:09:55,091 --> 03:10:11,008
and I really appreciate that that was
something I don't know where that came from
but I I noticed that sad just when we ran
the dockerfile when we did the doctor
container we got a lot more information
about what was going wrong

1142
03:10:11,008 --> 03:10:21,908
and and I feel like that's where their
efforts are focused so I kind of want to
keep doing that ready for the live Birds
thing

1143
03:10:27,964 --> 03:10:33,732
it's all I saw kbm Kimu plus live Birds

1144
03:10:33,930 --> 03:10:37,872
another project another lab for that

1145
03:10:38,726 --> 03:10:42,600
make sure you fix all of her issues

1146
03:10:43,813 --> 03:10:47,549
and so vagrant for Linux

1147
03:10:47,832 --> 03:10:55,532
I kind of think we should just say we should
just do the docker file assault

1148
03:10:55,532 --> 03:11:02,373
install vagrant for Linux Docker image

1149
03:11:07,970 --> 03:11:14,744
and make these bald so

1150
03:11:14,744 --> 03:11:19,759
docker if if you haven't already

1151
03:11:33,338 --> 03:11:38,339
give me a work it's been a long painful
Journey Tony

1152
03:11:39,275 --> 03:11:52,768
I don't know if I can suggest you watch the
whole thing if you want the highlights I can
give you those backed up probably do a video
of my summary of all the learning

1153
03:11:54,540 --> 03:11:56,620
suffice it to say

1154
03:11:58,631 --> 03:12:03,379
vagrant vagrant sold as a ton of Reba
dependencies

1155
03:12:03,723 --> 03:12:19,384
and it doesn't play nicely with Levert and
Ubuntu also has a ton of problems with
libvirt so I'm going to give you a few
things that might help you out the first
thing is if I did this over again

1156
03:12:20,214 --> 03:12:21,713
I would

1157
03:12:23,601 --> 03:12:41,160
I don't know but I would probably is ready
on the difference the problem though is if
you want to use this stuff on your local
system you have to use the vert and you have
to use a bunch of probably either that or
Archer maybe Arch doesn't have the same
problems I don't know people use artes they
are used to these kind of problems so

1158
03:12:41,628 --> 03:12:42,942
if

1159
03:12:43,373 --> 03:13:20,249
I don't think I'm ready I don't think I'm
ready to throw out my desktop workstation
and use red hat or Cento us as my go-to
daily driver I just it's just not set for
set up for that I don't think I would want
to do that and all of the problems I had a
lot of them was with Bert would have been
avoided if I had so that means you have to
go there getting his chemo and liver liver
instead of just the average person who wants
to use bacon is just going to use virtualbox
to be done right to the beginners out there
this is what I would suggest install
virtualbox cuz you need it no matter what

1160
03:13:20,259 --> 03:13:58,922
Universal box anyway right most of the time
you need. I said just works and it's just
very easiest very beginner friendly and you
just download an ISO and you play around
with all your different Linux distros get
that skill make sure you can do that that's
good because you can try our child you can
try you know any history want and I'll draw
Elemental as you can try them all out and
see which one you want so that still have
used a whole box of the thing the next
schedule after that that I will I'm going to
talk about the infrastructure Engineering in
the boots in that would be to run in a
distance darker would be to run a vagrant

1161
03:13:58,927 --> 03:14:26,937
using so they can is like hey you remember
all the stuff we did with the gooey let's go
do it from the command line you can do it
from the virtualbox command line or you can
use vagrant and we're going to use that
instead because the vagrant command line is
going to be reusable for other providers as
well and then the third steps at 3 would be
probably write this down the third step is
anything that that uses histrionics it's my
daily driver yet

1162
03:14:26,942 --> 03:14:53,737
it's so that the third thing would be okay
now let's Leo so use the ultra-fast an ultra
crew or cool chemo and KVM on the local
system and let's combine that as a provider
for vagrant and that would be the third
thing and then that would be an introduction
to KVM and chemo and why you would use it so
actually I got to write this down because I
just want to

1163
03:14:57,068 --> 03:15:03,049
introduction to virtualization

1164
03:15:06,595 --> 03:15:13,819
so this is me my my normal route it was B
install virtualbox

1165
03:15:15,641 --> 03:15:21,886
and get a it's over to box

1166
03:15:21,886 --> 03:15:24,648
install Windows

1167
03:15:27,728 --> 03:15:34,608
into a VM set up a Windows VM

1168
03:15:37,566 --> 03:15:43,558
set up a Linux VM in virtualbox

1169
03:15:43,676 --> 03:15:50,847
set up a about this one too set up

1170
03:15:50,847 --> 03:15:57,011
an arch set up

1171
03:15:57,011 --> 03:16:01,186
a red hat maybe try Suzy

1172
03:16:04,099 --> 03:16:09,580
and these aren't these are kind of things
right and then what I would try

1173
03:16:10,366 --> 03:16:15,893
a set up a

1174
03:16:17,271 --> 03:16:24,845
send a virtual box VM from at using vagrants

1175
03:16:25,648 --> 03:16:27,901
I install vagrant

1176
03:16:33,178 --> 03:16:35,132
at using vagrant

1177
03:16:37,678 --> 03:16:43,158
install KVM Kimu

1178
03:16:45,292 --> 03:16:46,937
linford's

1179
03:16:55,324 --> 03:16:59,686
Lynn words G

1180
03:17:04,493 --> 03:17:12,469
and set up I can figure

1181
03:17:14,424 --> 03:17:18,047
and then what then I would say

1182
03:17:20,724 --> 03:17:25,447
set up a set up a live Birds

1183
03:17:31,041 --> 03:17:38,311
set up set up a liver VM using vagrant no
setup

1184
03:17:39,125 --> 03:17:43,589
set up and then

1185
03:17:44,181 --> 03:17:50,689
verts yam is a virtual manager

1186
03:17:56,345 --> 03:17:59,079
I said living room using make ranch

1187
03:18:11,424 --> 03:18:14,892
solve a grant as Docker container

1188
03:18:26,687 --> 03:18:32,526
and said Liberty in using a vagrant

1189
03:18:34,187 --> 03:18:35,813
container

1190
03:18:39,736 --> 03:18:47,023
set up multiple

1191
03:18:49,965 --> 03:18:56,001
yams at the same time using a crunch

1192
03:18:57,517 --> 03:19:01,881
and then configure

1193
03:19:02,867 --> 03:19:07,541
multiple vlans with ansible

1194
03:19:16,164 --> 03:19:20,050
combines with vagrants

1195
03:19:25,655 --> 03:19:32,169
head out goodnight baby buddy but animals do
not want to

1196
03:19:34,741 --> 03:19:36,828
yep for sure

1197
03:19:38,258 --> 03:19:42,770
and those are really expecting me to know
the ins-and-outs of your daddy's maybe they
are

1198
03:19:45,069 --> 03:19:52,617
so yeah

1199
03:19:57,707 --> 03:20:01,219
here's what I suggest

1200
03:20:01,219 --> 03:20:11,952
to get your head around all that is possible
with virtual ization

1201
03:20:14,516 --> 03:20:21,917
I was going to keep adding so install

1202
03:20:22,869 --> 03:20:28,267
several physical servers at home

1203
03:20:32,316 --> 03:20:39,231
combined physical servers with proxmox

1204
03:20:39,231 --> 03:20:45,269
hey thanks for that I feel servers withwords
with frocks locks or something

1205
03:20:57,127 --> 03:20:59,320
set up several

1206
03:21:02,512 --> 03:21:06,298
GM's using Salt Air form

1207
03:21:10,744 --> 03:21:18,670
plant nursery rhymes using terraform pointed
at physical

1208
03:21:19,082 --> 03:21:25,356
when did that proxmox so this is all stuff I
want to do

1209
03:21:26,681 --> 03:21:30,543
so that I need to do more immediately than
others

1210
03:21:33,420 --> 03:21:38,476
so I mean that's going to get you started I
guess

1211
03:22:10,978 --> 03:22:12,224
yeah

1212
03:22:31,582 --> 03:22:38,249
can Aloha salon

1213
03:22:39,251 --> 03:22:41,855
so there we go

1214
03:22:47,544 --> 03:22:56,226
and we go through that

1215
03:22:59,158 --> 03:23:04,702
2 2 2 2 2 Foot Locker

1216
03:23:06,825 --> 03:23:12,048
so vagrant container

1217
03:23:21,448 --> 03:23:26,497
don't need the plug-in if you do the
container inspiring

1218
03:23:28,143 --> 03:23:32,385
thank you for saying so I need that right
now

1219
03:23:33,550 --> 03:23:37,018
I don't feel very inspiring but whatever

1220
03:23:40,253 --> 03:23:45,622
so hey Ya

1221
03:23:49,393 --> 03:23:53,674
or Nick's on two

1222
03:24:01,225 --> 03:24:03,130
alright so

1223
03:24:03,395 --> 03:24:09,625
Rena Al hemerson machine with Lindbergh
provider create a

1224
03:24:12,937 --> 03:24:14,277
create

1225
03:24:33,201 --> 03:24:35,950
yeah actually we don't even need to do the
pole

1226
03:24:36,903 --> 03:24:44,311
okay focus is firing me or should I just
this is for my survival so I can go through
in search of Molino

1227
03:24:45,317 --> 03:24:57,311
i c i I do all these things so that I can go
back and remember and I just searched
through my stuff when I need to you know and
if some of those benefits then so be it
right

1228
03:24:59,604 --> 03:25:21,559
the ansible add hot commands and we're
really cool I'm so glad that that turned out
to be a thing I did learn ansible tonight I
mean enough for me to move on and say I know
I know it enough to be dangerous pretty big
a machine with a fact that's the next step I
feel like I feel like we're kind of at a
stopping point I don't want to do something
fun tonight as well

1229
03:25:20,813 --> 03:25:22,967
as well

1230
03:25:23,349 --> 03:25:37,806
at me this is been fun it's just been really
hard on my soul so if you're in the box and
we have so I think I think we're back at the
vagrant

1231
03:25:39,802 --> 03:25:44,526
and I don't even think we need to change the
way bigger and file delivered any more we
don't need you then

1232
03:25:45,084 --> 03:25:47,935
so so yeah

1233
03:25:51,222 --> 03:25:55,992
yep and I think we have a machine

1234
03:25:56,535 --> 03:26:01,396
and I think I can ssh what do we call it

1235
03:26:03,982 --> 03:26:08,944
I think we can do SSH

1236
03:26:09,194 --> 03:26:12,115
and that's going to give me access to it
there we go

1237
03:26:15,138 --> 03:26:17,206
I do feel like

1238
03:26:17,408 --> 03:26:25,188
yeah we're just on the server right just a
basic server yeah it SSH is into your
current server and that crazy

1239
03:26:25,667 --> 03:26:32,704
I feel like I can because this is managed by
live bird I think I can use this to I think
I could just do this

1240
03:26:33,525 --> 03:26:40,067
I can absolutely can I didn't tell me what
my password was though

1241
03:26:43,360 --> 03:26:50,266
no I didn't even give me one that's super
interesting so vagrant does Issa stage
passwords

1242
03:26:51,701 --> 03:26:57,618
as if I did password let me try this so I
can do

1243
03:26:58,422 --> 03:27:03,140
password as I can figure a way to send even
if it doesn't have a user

1244
03:27:03,818 --> 03:27:08,156
oh yeah it doesn't even have a user I wish
it

1245
03:27:08,439 --> 03:27:14,974
so yes it was so that's super interesting so
that means when

1246
03:27:16,899 --> 03:27:23,214
listen so Megan is totally going to change
this is all bullshit

1247
03:27:24,373 --> 03:27:31,791
it is almost you're not doing any of this
I'm not doing any of this

1248
03:27:34,174 --> 03:27:41,760
this is all bulshit for reference

1249
03:27:47,015 --> 03:27:54,390
best way to do this so far is to do the very
first thing I recommend

1250
03:27:54,446 --> 03:28:08,208
and there it is right there that is how he
was a good old doctor huh I mean this is
like a real solid example of why darker
matters so strongly

1251
03:28:09,827 --> 03:28:24,905
and and that's all I have to say about that
in fact I'm going to CD back into my. Files
and we going to my installer and I'm going
to exchange vagrants

1252
03:28:25,183 --> 03:28:30,057
they move it I did did

1253
03:28:30,087 --> 03:28:37,681
that should stall vagrants smocks install
vagrants

1254
03:28:37,987 --> 03:28:43,073
vagrants Ben Bosch

1255
03:28:49,281 --> 03:28:52,199
Echo

1256
03:29:01,717 --> 03:29:08,847
do you know add function

1257
03:29:10,557 --> 03:29:15,035
they are not telling us

1258
03:29:17,558 --> 03:29:24,770
measure C we can do this thing to say

1259
03:29:27,702 --> 03:29:32,796
type vagrant

1260
03:29:32,796 --> 03:29:37,059
run that you're bash and we get the output
there we go

1261
03:29:39,679 --> 03:29:42,132
single thing

1262
03:29:51,900 --> 03:29:55,664
it always puts tabs into I don't like that

1263
03:30:00,826 --> 03:30:05,610
if you're doing remote ones you don't need
itremote ones you don't need it so we are
however using

1264
03:30:07,590 --> 03:30:14,858
real passing of you need me to be D it's all
need

1265
03:30:15,183 --> 03:30:22,430
continuations Network host

1266
03:30:25,319 --> 03:30:32,297
that's supposed to be quoted you bad coders

1267
03:30:34,182 --> 03:30:40,528
I think I am ADD install vagrant

1268
03:30:44,279 --> 03:30:50,752
alright so how fast RC commit

1269
03:30:51,246 --> 03:30:54,916
add back vagrant

1270
03:30:59,934 --> 03:31:05,074
vajtuse container

1271
03:31:09,492 --> 03:31:17,204
all right that that is excellent news I do
still have to relearn you know some Ruby and
stuff

1272
03:31:18,199 --> 03:31:23,632
but who gives a shit don't need to worry
about that

1273
03:31:24,648 --> 03:31:34,567
I was looking at some additional Fuller to
the guests we have the first argument is a
path so you can actually synchronize the
folder so you can put it vagrant file

1274
03:31:34,899 --> 03:31:43,517
inside of something that you want to
initialize like with a with a bachelor
seniors and all that kind of stuff

1275
03:31:44,092 --> 03:31:50,929
and password for bigger boxes I did not know
that tell her that it's nice okay good to
know

1276
03:31:54,927 --> 03:31:58,078
I'm I'm going to take all the stuff out that
I don't need

1277
03:32:01,919 --> 03:32:09,224
God dammit is it end yeah I'm going to get
good at Ruby again

1278
03:32:10,661 --> 03:32:15,829
I forgot you could do that would be high

1279
03:32:15,882 --> 03:32:20,551
yeah I found some time if you don't want to
use a shipping line

1280
03:32:20,552 --> 03:32:26,950
you can do that which this is not designed
to have anyting Romanian it

1281
03:32:27,534 --> 03:32:31,821
out status statues

1282
03:32:33,640 --> 03:32:39,979
alright so I'm getting this too far I can
put it to bed

1283
03:32:45,378 --> 03:32:52,367
private key why didn't put my private key in
there

1284
03:32:56,629 --> 03:33:00,007

1286
03:33:05,670 --> 03:33:09,699
I think there's like a standard maker and
ignore file right

1287
03:33:18,276 --> 03:33:23,713
getting Nora I mean

1288
03:33:24,804 --> 03:33:27,320
can't ignore

1289
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:38,465

03:33:41,499 --> 03:33:46,721

1291
03:33:48,104 --> 03:33:52,038

status Game Force

1294
03:34:09,509 --> 03:34:15,726
I don't think I tagged that one no what's a
vagrant

1295
03:34:15,726 --> 03:34:21,161
so here it is is my steps and all my links

1296
03:34:22,120 --> 03:34:30,011
ortholinks Aaron different things it

1297
03:34:34,012 --> 03:34:40,833
oh shit is not in his

1298
03:34:53,146 --> 03:34:56,401
I was going to put these in here I don't
have time to fuck with it

1299
03:35:17,957 --> 03:35:24,506
all right I I feel good right so tomorrow
tomorrow to work day

1300
03:35:26,671 --> 03:35:33,600
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to write a vagrant file to bring up

1301
03:35:34,397 --> 03:35:40,329
3 GM's

1302
03:35:42,080 --> 03:35:50,188
when I was going to be the control plane one
of them is going to be an external server
and one of them is going to be a node

1303
03:35:50,321 --> 03:36:00,929
and on the external server I'm going to
install a singer and all of its dependencies
postgres and everything on the Node

1304
03:36:01,409 --> 03:36:15,755
well I don't care about the note we just
have to know to be the node I'm going to run
to Cuba ATM to do the insulation in the DM's
without using node that using a kind

1305
03:36:15,958 --> 03:36:19,012
I'm actually super excited about that
because I've never done it

1306
03:36:19,659 --> 03:36:28,459
and that should get me pretty far if not if
I want to add redundancy I can do that Henry
Carpenter Settles

1307
03:36:29,926 --> 03:36:31,812
I just searched everything

1308
03:36:32,254 --> 03:36:40,810
I saw a group or whatever so here's
everything I ever wrote about zettelkasten
right there

1309
03:36:41,446 --> 03:36:44,005
it's an aerosol built-in to get him

1310
03:36:44,162 --> 03:37:44,816
you get a free localized personal search
engine and get him for free that's the
reason I haven't rented it as a web page
because I don't want to fucking around with
Google and wait forever for Google to index
it I get him in almost immediately and it's
immediately visible most I can also just get
grab the thing and I know if you noticed but
I put all of my chat transcript in there as
well so I can if I want to see when I talked
about something on a given day I can go back
and find it so I really like that that's
just all come in come up that's all come
about because of a necessity really it's not
something I ever like you know consciously
thought about it just it's just right you
know you know it's off it's just a bunch of
read me files and get them the greatest
power from it comes from its Simplicity and
if I want to pull out of it if I want to
pull out like a website where I want to put
which I am going to do or go out I need to
make a nap cuz I'm the one downside of the
whole system right now is it if I am away
from my computer I have to have no way to
enter

1311
03:37:44,824 --> 03:38:01,003
you know what your date or anything it's
over the way I do that as I take a piece of
paper with me to write on it or I take my
phone and I talk into it but if I could talk
into an app on my phone and have it update
my little castle and get him that would be
the best and I will make that eventually
just a matter of time

1312
03:38:01,006 --> 03:38:15,481
so we're going to be a now know where we are
but I need to learn of EMS this is it this
is a matter of necessity so I have got to
learn to that how to do DM's because of the
ends are one of the few ways you can blow
something up

1313
03:38:15,481 --> 03:38:28,034
right so the ends are we on our way for you
to like destroy the universe without
destroying anything you cannot do that with
docker

1314
03:38:28,035 --> 03:38:37,619
so in case anybody is wondering where is
this you know where is interested bm2 coming
out from all the sudden I had

1315
03:38:37,620 --> 03:39:22,252
a tasket work which was ultimately check the
the the disc you know ization for a position
volume which is already hard enough and and
that means it implies being able to fill a
desk are getting pretty close and see what
happens when you fill it in that led me to
conclude that there that I can't do that in
kind which uses Docker to emulate a
kubernetes environment is not a true one and
if I were to do that same sort of testing on
kind I would have had to fill my route hard
drive because Docker right I don't have a
separate volume I have imagined I could do
some magic with doctor and have it use a
different volume and blah blah blah and Feel
That by Eminem and tried you actually I
tried to use NFS is a different storage

1316
03:39:20,955 --> 03:40:17,657
storage classes and kind and then filled in
NFS mountain and have that report and I
probably will end up doing it again anyway
but but another easy way to do that easier
way is to just at which also fills another
need which is to set up a true kubernetes
environment is to setup a virtual machine in
this is you'll see a bunch of old hats with
kubernetes on YouTube that's what they do
they pop up 3 or 4:10 different you know
computers virtual machines with vagrant and
an ale then configure those to run for
vanities and no the practice of the
community skills and they'll try their
different appointments and stuff then I'll
tear the whole thing down with you know one
vagrant come in and so that is what I seek
to do so that when I blow up the disk on a
virtual machine it doesn't touch the host of
operating system at all

1317
03:40:17,663 --> 03:41:17,741
so in my case coronavirus will run on top of
a VM yeah it's actually it's not as fast but
for the sake of testing and development of
being able to bring up a number and it's a
bit a bit of infrastructure and then bring
up vm's and then do that and then covering
it he's an install cameras on those virtual
machines if you think about it that's
exactly what's happening a Google and Amazon
and as they are running kubernetes in
Virtual machines every single one of them I
think I think some there's some of that are
starting to offer on metal but mostly they
are doing that already so they're already
running it on a virtual machine in that
gives you the flexibility to developer to
like messy or configuration and stuff and so
that's that's why I'm doing this I want to
be able to break things and not have it
break the host operating system and darker
is not good enough for that doctor might let
you mess with your files and just as
ephemeral

1318
03:41:17,748 --> 03:42:17,900
throw it away and make a new one which is
great for learning how to code and stuff but
when it comes to testing how am I going to
screw over the storage class by filling a
disc and really messing with it and that's
not the kind of thing that you can test with
containers because you need devices for that
and in order to have devices you have to
have a machine and in order to have a
machine without a physical machine you need
to be M so he thinks it's all foggy so
that's that's that's what's going on I know
I feel like you know burned myself out today
so I'm going to get no hard feelings if
anybody's watching you know somebody gave me
it works on my machine today and I got a
little bent out of shape by then cuz I was
frustrated no hard feelings to anybody will
be all back where we were again will be good
friends tomorrow but I appreciate it and
really when I push the edge the way I have
been I mean I've been literally sitting here
for the most part since noon

1319
03:42:18,699 --> 03:43:18,128
you know I I tend to to burn out quickly
when I'm trying to do too many things at
once but but I want to say that I feel like
today was a Monumental success I can't
believe it ended with me going back to
vagrant then that just blows my mind and I
can't I'm going to focus on the good things
I can't overstate my appreciation for chunky
who helped us fix liver knowing that there
were problems and being able to specifically
identify those problems would she have now
codified into something that could be
followed in fixed for anybody on a bun to
that is not something you're going to be
able to avoid if you want to run vagrant on
want to you're not going to able to get away
from that so yeah. Darker does have
limitations doctor is just at the end of the
day everything in dr. shares the same
underlying operating system and machine

1320
03:43:18,135 --> 03:43:35,277
Docker everything in Docker it might look
like a separate machine but it's not it's
sharing the same Colonel as sharing the same
memory Works in my machine if you say it
works on my machine you need to back it up
right

1321
03:43:35,278 --> 03:44:02,167
and you need to tell me what your machine is
and whether it's a bunch of my stuff like
that I just I don't I don't I've never dealt
with that I've never dealt well with the
with the works for me you're just a dumb ass
and you've obviously Fox something up that
that kind of attitude I have no Toleration
for that attitude at all and nit you run
into that attitude all the time MacGyver
actually that's where he's gone to because
he's given the same shit as well and I timed
him out

1322
03:44:00,804 --> 03:45:01,318
well and I can't imagine never came back if
you going to treat me like that or you like
that and they don't want to come back I'm
sorry I I don't want to do well on the drama
but I really don't give a shit people that
act like that and I TR toxic plague and I
just don't want him anywhere near me I am
toxic Enough by myself I can plenty toxic
you know and I think you should strive to
understand and and and you don't people do
do that and then they still think I do I
can't I don't know what I want to say it
works on the machine and if that's the truth
and you know at least back it up and he did
so temperature in your contacts cause 90% of
a drama yeah it's true it's true and I don't
want to make this an attack on a new one
person this is this is about it's more about
a personality type and if you're in it for
any amount of time you know these people
you've worked with these people people think
I am this guy and it too many and many times
I am that guy

1323
03:45:01,325 --> 03:45:20,938
you know and it's it's just doesn't help
that so curious if you increase the replica
set is there still is as soon as you say
machine if you're in Docker absolutely yeah
if using doctors your driver in Kinder
minikube both of which you sucker is it the
fault wherever that finds it yes the answer
is yes

1324
03:45:21,025 --> 03:45:28,161
if used MINI coop if use MINI Coupe with a
virtual machine or a liver driver it
actually makes a separate machine

1325
03:45:28,222 --> 03:45:58,597
and some people would argue that that's
maybe the way to do this if I can't let me
think about that for a second if I were to
use a mini cube with and I were to change
the driver in mini Cube it would actually
spin up actual machines that I could then
break and I wouldn't have to do the cut the
cube ATM stuff I kind of want to do the
Canadian stuff because I need to learn it as
well but but you don't make you the
difference between Cuban kind is it mini
Cube lets you use avert an actual virtual
machine

1326
03:45:58,600 --> 03:46:25,429
and kind kind does not know the virtual
machine that gives you is highly customized
to run to ronettis and it and you know you
can get over there and do your thing but I
don't know is if you do with vagrant then
you're actually install and committed
yourself to letting me keep sage in that
case has it's like it stalls. It is for you
and me keep does let you drive it right so
it can do that

1327
03:46:26,481 --> 03:46:33,240
so now sorry me too

1328
03:46:36,799 --> 03:46:38,847
make you

1329
03:46:43,001 --> 03:46:50,597
oh my gosh who am I copy. I hope I don't
have covid-19

1330
03:46:50,597 --> 03:46:56,828
you know I might have it God damn it this
feels like it

1331
03:46:58,121 --> 03:47:04,957
am I cry this is not an allergy this is
something different my son has covid is next
door

1332
03:47:05,196 --> 03:47:10,339
yeah I was confirmed he's only supposed to
be contagious for three more days

1333
03:47:10,339 --> 03:47:16,759
I know it doesn't equal, but I'm still
terrified omnicron doesn't get your sense of
taste is bad

1334
03:47:17,902 --> 03:47:19,779
I know

1335
03:47:19,779 --> 03:47:27,490
I am sure I don't have it I I I get allergic
to things to drink some hot tea I know

1336
03:47:28,278 --> 03:47:30,884
I'm sure something

1337
03:47:31,399 --> 03:47:37,908
yeah I'll be fine so

1338
03:47:39,728 --> 03:47:47,384
mini can help started leaving at 4 doctor in
vpod man out on this profile

1339
03:47:47,384 --> 03:47:53,631
teleservices Mount shuttle I do like this
might be the way to go actually

1340
03:47:56,134 --> 03:48:07,480
and I feel like crap I know I know I know
I've heard that story more than once
actually free people suck with that

1341
03:48:07,480 --> 03:48:09,953
let me just say

1342
03:48:09,953 --> 03:48:18,479
get some vitamin D think yeah yes yes vanity
and sink always works actually have that
stuff somewhere

1343
03:48:18,479 --> 03:48:27,414
I'm really glad that I we talk through this
just now because I think the fastest way to
test what I want is to use mini cube with

1344
03:48:27,415 --> 03:48:33,531
is to is to use mini cube with a Levert
driver

1345
03:48:33,531 --> 03:48:36,742
and I'm kind of curious right now

1346
03:48:38,709 --> 03:48:41,625
I'm kind of getting ahead of myself I'm not
going to sleep unless I look at

1347
03:48:46,558 --> 03:48:53,307
thank you that's not the kind of things you
do kind by the way image

1348
03:48:54,576 --> 03:48:59,580
OS and you can just not exist

1349

Lincoln Logs

1350
03:49:08,134 --> 03:49:13,359
I don't remember right my kind of Mini
Cooper has a mixing up

1351
03:49:16,371 --> 03:49:20,591
interesting I want to do something here mini
Cube

1352
03:49:22,281 --> 03:49:24,489
I can do that. So nodes

1353
03:49:26,981 --> 03:49:32,556
I don't know it's too late snowed I think of
ways to catch a dance coffee

1354
03:49:32,893 --> 03:49:35,029
Lane service status

1355
03:49:37,759 --> 03:49:45,310
American not found right mini Cube let's
tell me about some

1356
03:49:45,572 --> 03:49:51,754
yeah okay so we can actually we could do one

1357
03:49:52,196 --> 03:49:58,207
I'll give you like the number of notes
everything how is it it's like

1358
03:49:59,804 --> 03:50:06,834
I'm trying to find it the most survivors is
a KVM

1359
03:50:10,274 --> 03:50:16,615
got if we could use it we may live right
driver window work before but I just
installed it so I think I can do it now

1360
03:50:19,253 --> 03:50:27,127
Advocate doctor finds them in order by the
way there's a box parallel to M & S H

1361
03:50:28,248 --> 03:50:35,899
remote SSH was that even mean that's Mac
well

1362
03:50:36,528 --> 03:50:40,288
Lenox Dr KVM KVM

1363
03:50:42,231 --> 03:50:47,709
god dammit give him being based preferred

entertain her legs container pod-man nunber
metal

1365
03:50:55,405 --> 03:50:58,182
what when do they have none

1366
03:51:06,649 --> 03:51:13,332
give him two mini Q

1367
03:51:13,620 --> 03:51:19,948
create cluster create SP

1371
03:51:50,747 --> 03:51:55,020
start KVM driver

1372
03:51:58,028 --> 03:52:06,904
Chris gave him TV unless it's not going to
work now because Kate many confusing it must
I turn it off

1373
03:52:10,442 --> 03:52:17,703
holy shit look at this it's using a Mini
Cooper I so it's actually doing like a
vagrant and creating a new image

1374
03:52:18,273 --> 03:52:25,170
and it's doing to I think it's 32 or the
richest thing one

1375
03:52:25,170 --> 03:52:31,981
is there any control plane node flooring
closer how's it going alley

1376
03:52:31,981 --> 03:52:39,574
Ali can't get on

1377
03:52:39,574 --> 03:52:43,064
hey Cat

1378
03:52:46,047 --> 03:52:52,794
more Cube system pod Courtney and S only
shit

1379
03:52:52,795 --> 03:52:54,955
holyshit

1380
03:52:58,560 --> 03:53:05,050
mksh Roselle

1381
03:53:05,089 --> 03:53:10,508
SP Color Oops

1382
03:53:10,635 --> 03:53:17,357
any cube is how fast that was holyshit
holyshit

1383
03:53:17,357 --> 03:53:21,439
wait I come isn't home darker I don't
supposed to be darker

1384
03:53:22,759 --> 03:53:30,750
I can't get no MK list MK

1385
03:53:32,400 --> 03:53:40,247
profile running Docker on time VM driver KVM

1386
03:53:41,158 --> 03:53:43,713
how is it doing a doctor run time though

1387
03:53:47,571 --> 03:53:49,698
it doesn't make any sense

1388
03:53:56,307 --> 03:54:02,552
what are the valid neq run times

1389
03:54:08,052 --> 03:54:12,585
in time antenna run time to PCS

1390
03:54:12,967 --> 03:54:18,081
doctor o m m m m n a c container engine I
feel stupid

1391
03:54:19,577 --> 03:54:27,118
the Emmys I just ran into him yeah as it
says

1392
03:54:28,446 --> 03:54:33,714
this is a VM this is 100% of e m

1393
03:54:36,395 --> 03:54:40,061
yeah it's a totally understand its own
network and everything

1394
03:54:42,642 --> 03:54:48,191
yeah watch said I had to do this I mean d a
p l c

1395
03:54:50,021 --> 03:54:51,327
I got

1396
03:54:54,506 --> 03:54:59,770
I mean that that might be in that might be a
pretty I think I might be in trouble here

1397
03:55:02,557 --> 03:55:08,649
are you see this it has see how much she a
little say a little Ramen has

1398
03:55:10,087 --> 03:55:14,900
now there's all on my computer that I'm
streaming from so

1399
03:55:21,008 --> 03:55:28,591
sh Moore

1400
03:55:29,418 --> 03:55:35,558
how many gig is a 14-9 see how things are
going for now you know why because the root
file system watch

1401
03:55:36,711 --> 03:56:12,233
agonize over the amounts you know what the
other or do they mail stuff from mini Cube
these are these are from this is so fucking
awesome this is a big me to get fat again it
look kind a Mini Cooper Fantastic Four
different reasons but this is really great
this fixes the problem I was having I don't
know why I didn't think about this before I
needed a miniature you can use a driver I
can blow up a Mini Coop node and not have it
touched my computer because he uses me a
driver you should be really careful because
the default for mini cube is to use Docker
if it finds on your system

1402
03:56:12,585 --> 03:56:28,609
how to start a clean environment absolutely
and that's what this is about the sun trying
to tell you this actually does everything
that I needed it sets it up it's got a
Docker container over here it's like an
amazing I mean this is really amazing

1403
03:56:32,503 --> 03:56:38,779
I just I don't know how this this is yet
another way to solve the problem

1404
03:56:39,260 --> 03:56:52,904
She-Ra somebody dropped out oh yeah starting
you know they're building yourself a cluster
or practicing test and get some certificates
or something and has lots of ways to get you
work right

1405
03:56:54,863 --> 03:56:57,623
this this is phenomenal to me

1406
03:57:01,003 --> 03:57:07,105
oh my God is running at CD and everything
this is so fucking awesome

1407
03:57:07,105 --> 03:57:11,758
this is so fucking awesome

1408
03:57:13,054 --> 03:57:18,267
I'm so glad we learn about Big Orange but
the difference is that

1409
03:57:18,268 --> 03:57:27,543
if I do it with vagrant then I have to set
up an ansible thing to set up the
communities environment when it Vinnie Cube
does all of that automatically for you

1410
03:57:28,582 --> 03:57:33,941
well I I actually I'm going to write about
this

1411
03:57:34,463 --> 03:57:39,722
any Cube with

1412
03:57:39,723 --> 03:57:46,713
the VM with a KVM to driver

1413
03:57:48,075 --> 03:57:51,480
when's a

1414
03:57:54,134 --> 03:58:01,188
for the win I have had a second to put kind
for fast

1415
03:58:02,435 --> 03:58:05,447
mini Cube Plus

1416
03:58:07,370 --> 03:58:11,756
KVM to driver for real

1417
03:58:16,416 --> 03:58:23,619
people like me asking a question

1418
03:58:26,264 --> 03:58:36,825
should I use KVM I mean should you use
unique you or kind to learn kubernetes are

1419
03:58:44,238 --> 03:58:45,642
people

1420
03:58:50,215 --> 03:58:55,259
yes both are amazing and essential

1421
03:58:59,382 --> 03:59:07,061
kind is the lightest-weight and the fastest
to set up

1422
03:59:07,354 --> 03:59:13,421
but mini Cube with a

1423
03:59:13,660 --> 03:59:20,381
true virtual machine driver like KVM

1424
03:59:21,160 --> 03:59:26,042
is the most real

1425
03:59:32,489 --> 03:59:34,529
real setup

1426
03:59:41,260 --> 03:59:43,073
I discovered this

1427
03:59:47,049 --> 03:59:59,001
I'll try and you to blow up a storage class
to see what would break and how I would know

1428
04:00:00,350 --> 04:00:03,673
so that I could write software to prevent it

1429
04:00:13,836 --> 04:00:23,164
such a task is very precarious with kind
since there is

1430
04:00:23,797 --> 04:00:28,528
nothing protecting your

1431
04:00:31,289 --> 04:00:39,600
hard drive that is being used as the default
storage class

1432
04:00:40,359 --> 04:00:45,047
but with a VM how many Q

1433
04:00:47,731 --> 04:00:55,498
There is no danger even if I he'll the disc

1434
04:00:56,057 --> 04:01:03,276
this is perfect for really testing

1435
04:01:04,090 --> 04:01:11,296
testing scenarios you hope you never

1436
04:01:11,622 --> 04:01:20,211
have to see in the real world it's like
being able to

1437
04:01:21,107 --> 04:01:24,898
to do controlled Burns

1438
04:01:25,246 --> 04:01:30,817
As A Firefighter and get good dealing with
them

1439
04:01:33,927 --> 04:01:38,964
mini Cube is ideal for this

1440
04:01:42,142 --> 04:01:47,452
it's worth mentioning

1441
04:01:48,656 --> 04:01:56,356
that if and if you

1442
04:01:56,760 --> 04:01:59,546
I want to get hands

1443
04:01:59,546 --> 04:02:05,746
on experience installing an Enterprise

1444
04:02:06,633 --> 04:02:12,358
scale simulation of kubernetes

1445
04:02:12,793 --> 04:02:19,867
on machines easy

1446
04:02:21,084 --> 04:02:25,879
is in Cuba ATM that vagrant

1447
04:02:26,930 --> 04:02:34,037
with the liverworts then avert

1448
04:02:36,879 --> 04:02:43,907
driver allows or that

1449
04:02:44,971 --> 04:02:46,673
it does

1450
04:02:52,172 --> 04:02:57,125
it sets up all the

1451
04:02:57,607 --> 04:03:06,140
emulated virtual machines your computer your
workstation can support

1452
04:03:11,081 --> 04:03:17,040
about 1 / 1 GHz

1453
04:03:20,115 --> 04:03:24,201
of CPU what's the estimate

1454
04:03:27,479 --> 04:03:32,248
and then you are free to do the rest

1455
04:03:38,566 --> 04:03:40,207
so yeah

1456
04:03:45,785 --> 04:03:50,965
cloud cnco

1457
04:03:57,913 --> 04:03:59,682
her native

1458
04:04:03,870 --> 04:04:10,378
I don't know what else to say. He's testing

1459
04:04:13,249 --> 04:04:20,297
operations yep

1460
04:04:24,402 --> 04:04:26,554
supposed to last

1461
04:04:28,062 --> 04:04:37,076
there you go that's my summary on that and
and on that note

1462
04:04:38,258 --> 04:05:11,501
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to raid
at tennis who just came online and when
please say hi to hit I am going to go off
and play games we'll bit later tonight and I
don't know how long I'll be probably 5 10 15
minutes or something so again thank you
everybody I can't tell you how much fun this
has been at little thing at the end thereof
my summer is really been useful and going to
save me a lot of time tomorrow like a
tremendous amount of time I can have to set

have time otherwise I'll see you guys later

1463
04:05:11,504 --> 04:05:15,402
let me see where's my Raider Channel thing

1464
04:05:23,202 --> 04:05:28,584
yeah nice

1465
04:05:31,133 --> 04:05:34,983
are you raid in one second by everybody
