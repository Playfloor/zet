well as everything else in there I think
it's above us is like up filled up his image
is what it is it's one of those California
chesty things

77
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:41,365
what's that if a betta fish is pretty strong

78
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:47,660
that that that's because we have our senses
on and I've been living my senses on all day

79
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:55,646
if you maybe regular Key Food surge of
Senses of OSHA oh shit was this

80
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:59,953

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,121

82
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:17,350

time this is

83
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:20,646

sleep and come go to sleep right now

85
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:35,405
I kind of need to go to sleep I don't go to
sleep though cuz I'm a Witcher

86
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:42,268
stash this is cool anything you put in the
stash you can pull out of the stash later

87
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:46,424
I don't have anything in the stash cuz I
just saw my shit

88
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:55,715
but if I wanted to I could I guess I wanted
to put my fancy pants fancy ass like clothes
in there I probably should do that but no
I'm going to inspect

89
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:11,377
so we found series room so we have
tomorrow's room at the mystery of tomorrow
going on and we also have series room which
is the main quest tomorrow's questions
tomorrow we're having it tomorrow is kind of
a

90
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:18,874
, Cypress Bayou the natural obscurity of
curses

91
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:23,211
let's read it

92
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:36,394
to my dear friends Phillip banana from Court
minister of culture of the kingdom of
tameria Zima 1265

93
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:53,846
whoever thinks curses are only are only a
manifestation of one's being ill will
towards another his solar sorely mistaken
shockingly, play some reports a cast on it
wouldn't lie on oneself on object in one's
immediate environment the cause of doing so
can be difficult to predict

94
00:12:53,848 --> 00:13:11,826
in many cases that lead to harm or even
death of the person think about the curse or
other people spending time with the object
or being on which the first fell that is why
it is so essential to take preventative
measures to safeguard oneself as soon as
possible against the casting of curses as an
absolute minimum

95
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:25,662
Amelia Amelia Veracruz Leon recommends
cleansing oneself of all negative thoughts
striving to be at one with the world and
achieving Harmony baton between body and
mind what is she

96
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:33,896
well so there's something going on about
curses here

97
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:39,633
and they wouldn't tell us about curses
unless somebody was cursed

98
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:45,154
so I think somebody is cursed

99
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:50,471
somebody related to series Quest is cursed

100
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:56,747
we don't know who it's not Siri might be
Siri could be tomorrow

101
00:13:56,747 --> 00:14:00,194
some be related to Siri to sirius is course
they wouldn't give you a hint if it weren't
that

102
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:12,452
I got them with the lights on because it
just makes me happy enough that we had, nice
room there was this one over here to the
other Quest though

103
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:18,708

Witcher

186
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:53,970
I think it's funny that you cuz I still
everything in this game and did you ever get
any consequences unless you're like right in
front of the Guard

187
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:57,753
and they got to be able to figure out that I
took other stuff

188
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:07,904
okay I'm a little worried 222

189
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:21,701
Emerald dust shit Emerald us is good

190
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:28,903
you can craft all kinds of stuff like that I
think we're on the right track

191
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,520
the gala stuff guess not

192
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:46,713

cyanide

194

make it smaller my face you don't need to
see me this big

197
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:47,920
I think it's more that you guys have chat on
even make me turn chat off to me

198
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:58,388
and I got smaller like this really nothing

207
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:01,436

corner

208
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:14,598

go figure out where it is

344
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:16,857

bad

349
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:43,348

00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:47,799
Northern Realms guard

351
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:51,973
what's the new card I just got out of this

352
00:50:51,999 --> 00:51:04,607

that great of a card God damn it I need to
start winning some Heroes heroes are the
ones that kick ass this like this guy this
guy kicks ass man

353
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:15,368
that's a guaranteed can't touch him and he
can play that you can play with either place
that's going to be a good monster deck
eventually eventually

354
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:24,797
and the new here are there any and all these
are there any and all these it was this guy
Claire weather in that we don't do that

355
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:26,894
Circle Game

356
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:38,765
all right one last one I'll get some money
here I know you guys are bored with this is
really funny like a decoy I like it when
somebody is awesome

357
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:44,088
God damn it. I drew Alyssa same cards as
crazy

358
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:51,163
I mean he's kind of went so let's redo him
through him

359
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,676
all right that's better

360
00:51:56,753 --> 00:52:07,820
do you have any Siege things at all I don't
have no I do have a seat thing okay great
that's going to have to kick ass then these
guys are going to add points everybody okay
so big time Siege

361
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:16,672
I thought I did replace it I did I can
replace it but I got to see Joe God

362
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:23,806
I'm going to destroy him this turn level 1
all right

363
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:33,239
I mean hey look I got to work mr. Scalia guy

364
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:45,702
what is this fact so, that's why I thought

365
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:50,174
happy weekend everybody how are you

366
00:52:57,113 --> 00:53:06,241
Abigail I'm in this to win this about
Windows I win 20 gold which is a lot shit

367
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:08,622
what the fuck is that

368
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:18,563
do we want to keep going on with this battle
or not I guess we do

369
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:26,228
we're actually pretty well-matched

370
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,496
shit that's like do I want to let him win it
and burn up all those cards or not

371
00:53:38,921 --> 00:53:42,027
or do I really kick his ass right now

372
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:47,831
that's the trick right

373
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:59,467
I don't know if I'm if I'm at horn yet hey
look he put two people on there so if I did
that let's do this

374
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,814
he'll lose Marlisa.

375
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:07,816
All right so that's going to take us down a
notch that should put me ahead yeah

376
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:15,588
and that that was a good you said that card,
my God she's sexy I'm doing pretty good

377
00:54:16,813 --> 00:54:20,540
so when we got here

378
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:28,334
I think I'm winning actually it does he plan
on a car what the hell is Tuesday idiot

379
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:36,565
I'm going to gamble on this I'm going to get
in this game

380
00:54:36,758 --> 00:54:40,611
I'm pretty sure I get the next two games
automatically

381
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:47,383
it cuz he is out of cars and I have I just
put back in really high playing cards for my
deck

382
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:56,490
why did they pass why did he pass

383
00:55:02,352 --> 00:55:10,130
why did he pass that's interesting going to
pass to I'm going to give up on that game

384
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:19,159
depression test

385
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:25,706
play Chief Keef fast he literally passed out
I have to play as like one card

386
00:55:29,194 --> 00:55:31,549
I mean

387
00:55:36,161 --> 00:55:40,936
okay he already passed so I'm going to pass
now I'm going to win

388
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:46,663
I definitely won this he doesn't play every
fucking thing here

389
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:58,138
all right unless he has God damn I'm going
to blow him the fuck away if my Siege stuff

390
00:55:59,694 --> 00:56:06,044
you got nothingI'm I hate to tell you but
you got nothing

391
00:56:06,303 --> 00:56:13,373
imma let you pay all your fucking cards up
soon to blow you away unless you have
infinitive Austin there

392
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:21,180
and I frost the other one and unless he has
a weather card

393
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:24,281
if you have the weather card we are fucked

394
00:56:29,118 --> 00:56:34,690
let me watch watch this I'm going to double
it all at the very end 24

395
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:46,988
not sure what you got dude show me how much
I owe shit he had to put a weather thank God
I was afraid he had the other whether card
that would have kicked my ass watch this

396
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:52,188
30 what you got you don't even a damn cars
to play dude

397
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:55,566
are you not going to play that last card
what the fuck

398
00:56:57,424 --> 00:57:05,925
is there second game is Arthur game right
all right with feeling now 16 points vs your
13

399
00:57:09,977 --> 00:57:13,655
yeah that's me winning in a dramatic fashion

400
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:19,324
I don't think they hit he has any clear
stuff 120 friends or not

401
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:28,640
alright one more one more because I want to
buy those boots I want to buy those boots

402
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:36,164
I want to kick your ass and Gwen a couple
more times so I can buy the boots I know you
guys don't like this I don't care

403
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,464
all right let's do he doesn't have three to
deck it out

404
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:52,846
okay biting Frost knocks out first levels

405
00:57:53,892 --> 00:58:00,113
another Siege we got lots of first levels in
this deck

406
00:58:00,426 --> 00:58:08,226
so I will not be playing biting Frost ever
so we can replace that

407
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,816
it shut you are seized dudes

408
00:58:11,862 --> 00:58:20,627
oh my God we're going to kick out so it
doesn't have a spine this done this is fun
let's do it

409
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:27,634
I had a spy

410
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:32,825
weather in play something really good and
his spy the shit out of him

411
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:41,060
play Cervantes Battlefield counselor to
phone the solo and Draw 2 card from your
deck

412
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:44,073
as if I wasn't already going to win

413
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:50,931
you want to play Ultra is okay with the
archers

414
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:57,893
I think it's a good idea to keep on the same
room as him so it doesn't kill the weather
in the same row

415
00:58:58,924 --> 00:59:04,237
that's just a tactic Kimberly I'm flaking
ranged

416
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,707
what the hell

417
00:59:14,162 --> 00:59:16,050

418
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,608

you can have it

422
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:59,166
if you want it that bad it's fine the thing
the AI does not know how to do is when to
quit

423
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:06,367
it does not know when to quit it does not
it's stupid it doesn't know about the cards
to give him in until

424
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:14,503
if you want to only I that's why I that's
how you doing

425
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:20,190
got to actually get her

426
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:25,262

played instantly

427
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:32,807

431
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:15,059

think that's the transfer has probably
wasted right but I have to play him some
going because I have to buy those cards

545

I can do the the I just could not get into
the mechanic a mechanic is just just not my
thing

559
01:17:09,696 --> 01:17:15,329
you're really going to play that already did
you really want to win don't you

560
01:17:16,394 --> 01:17:23,608
I mean yeah you're done

561
01:17:23,755 --> 01:17:31,089
you're done if you're going to burn in a car
to try to beat that you're stupid uh oh

562
01:17:32,922 --> 01:17:38,959
seriously I am not spending any more cards
on you

563
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:44,871
oh that's the hot girl now I don't think
I'll ever

564
01:17:47,436 --> 01:17:57,294
why would you do that it's got to be going
to burn all of his cards of he had to draw
cards did you see that

565
01:17:57,296 --> 01:18:04,160
did you see that he had two spies shit I got
to remember that next round

566
01:18:04,672 --> 01:18:12,427
I should have decoyed I was stupid identical
I'll say my name over this right now

567
01:18:12,428 --> 01:18:14,811
I should be covered

568
01:18:19,742 --> 01:18:22,812
she passed really

569
01:18:27,857 --> 01:18:32,492
I think you just got I think they has a
bunch of other cards

570
01:18:32,493 --> 01:18:39,495
I shouldn't there I just forgot to do, again
I should be for this by yeah

571
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:46,124
yeah it was done I'm getting kind of sloppy
and I have a decoy enough to do

572
01:18:46,742 --> 01:18:51,853
he just pulled two cards out again a fucking

573
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:57,813
we might be in trouble I've been playing too
sloppy

574
01:18:57,813 --> 01:19:03,015
I can't play the decoy now God damn it cuz
I'm a lazy ass

575
01:19:03,015 --> 01:19:06,498
I did wrong I did it wrong

576
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:15,376
so I know there's a lot you know what you
didn't see my last three games I'm playing
this game really quickly

577
01:19:15,377 --> 01:19:22,966
so there I'd still think I I think I won

578
01:19:23,684 --> 01:19:30,686
please have a weather card please have a
weather card please I have a weather card
it's only got right here

579
01:19:33,746 --> 01:19:39,856
I don't think he has 22in I don't think he
does I'm going to say he doesn't

580
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:51,702
I don't think he has 22 in him I got 100 I
lucked out

581
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:54,890
and that eventually lost

582
01:19:55,347 --> 01:20:04,902
I put that fast I didn't pay attention I
miss play my my dick I didn't Paid It All
actually.

583
01:20:05,886 --> 01:20:12,028
Once ranked Siege once ranked sees you the
beating I didn't need to

584
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:19,395
I didn't need to swap I think I needed to

585
01:20:21,793 --> 01:20:29,172
that we could we could have did we could do
the we could do that he's got a lot of spies
I want to try something with the spies

586
01:20:31,684 --> 01:20:37,375
I want to try something with you spies I'm
going to try to steal one of the spies

587
01:20:38,343 --> 01:20:44,652
I think I can write I think I can still want
to despise of a plant

588
01:20:46,126 --> 01:20:52,824
also didn't play tarantula decoy

589
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:56,796
what kind of kind of what kind of spread out
that's not bad

590
01:20:57,175 --> 01:21:01,697
I'm kind of spread out he's kind of a dick
when you can replace him

591
01:21:04,647 --> 01:21:07,798
as much better all right I'll see you then

592
01:21:12,971 --> 01:21:19,121
when one car per person yeah I know I know

593
01:21:20,747 --> 01:21:28,371
I actually want to try something I needed
more money to so he just play this little
guy was she the same

594
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:40,011
I see how far it goes

595
01:21:54,215 --> 01:21:58,084
if he's going to push this. I think he's an
idiot

596
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:10,472
dad at at at at at at at at at at the
Georgia

597
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:24,251
Anchors Aweigh spit why did I get any cards

598
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:31,997
what happened why did I get any cars from
her I supposed to get a card from her

599
01:22:31,997 --> 01:22:39,040
oh I did have any discard I told him this
play that.

600
01:22:44,564 --> 01:22:46,964
I try to recover

601
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:55,269
and play something stupid you passed you
passed on 22 seriously

602
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:02,677
you're seriously going to pass on 22 God
damn it I mean it's an easy win

603
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:12,447
easy win so I can't stress it up there

604
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:15,833
tkl keyboard if you have a preference

605
01:23:16,017 --> 01:23:20,887
I don't know we talked about I don't give a
shit about keyboards

606
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:26,447
I used the best keyboard used by writers and
authors not gamers

607
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:36,080
I want to play early so I can get her decoy
back

608
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:39,252
I may have to buy a new car immediately
right

609
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:44,383
yeah that's to her

610
01:23:44,972 --> 01:23:58,108
Chucky's why I don't want travel on my keys
I want low-profile keyboard scientifically
proven to be better keep or better offer for
help better for type better for Speed

611
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:01,058
I guess

612
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:14,340
ticket to to to to to to to

613
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:23,630
are you just sending I don't know if any of
that yet

614
01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:28,099
I mean if I need to

615
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:40,359
I want to go to High I don't want to go too
high here we go

616
01:24:44,539 --> 01:24:50,485
66% size yeah I just in pain all the time

617
01:24:51,177 --> 01:24:56,165
I sent that all the time here I really am
not a fan of that stuff

618
01:25:02,658 --> 01:25:07,733
yeah I've seen a lot of them it's kind of
trendy it's like a Zoomer thing

619
01:25:09,113 --> 01:25:16,529
there's no reason for it just if you like it
you like it fine that's fine but just people
who like

620
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,916
history of the gates album

621
01:25:20,818 --> 01:25:31,396
crazy ass so you know cyberpunk keyboards or
understand funky words that are completely
useless but they like them you know and
that's fine that's what they like

622
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:40,319
12 to 12 who wins when there's a when
there's a tie so I want to know

623
01:25:41,966 --> 01:25:46,625
who wins when there's a tie I just want to
find out

624
01:25:48,485 --> 01:25:53,750
no because you can supply card hasn't passed
yet so

625
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:02,769
this is tricky on bike

626
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:10,122
there is actually a rule about this where
one always if there's a tie to automatically
win I think it's a monsters

627
01:26:14,353 --> 01:26:20,997
I really feel like it's dangerous to go
another round but if I knock him out on this
when I win the whole game so

628
01:26:21,689 --> 01:26:23,654
going to go ahead and do it

629
01:26:30,428 --> 01:26:33,386
right side real real estate

630
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:38,815
I stretch my shoulders recharge Mouse

631
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:43,271
yeah. That's that's a legit that's a legit
thing

632
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:50,701
yeah that's I think I could try to jail
based on that I hear what you're saying

633
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:54,342
I hear what you're saying yep

634
01:26:57,746 --> 01:27:23,933
I see what you did yeah that is that is
probably one of my biggest annoyances is
that I have to go so far I still use my
number I had for so much though you know
what I mean I really do I use my new phone
for a lot of things a nerd and numbers a lot
so I don't I don't but I do know what that
makes sense if only had to get do was go
over here that would that would reduce my
shoulder strain a lot

635
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:28,666
I think about that DiCaprio no that's a good
that's a good idea that's a good point

636
01:27:29,106 --> 01:27:37,877
yep Mac does make one that's just that's
just like the Strait of keys I do use the
arrow keys on occasion

637
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:44,476
there's no applications that make more sense
20 keys sometimes I use page epenesa

638
01:27:48,173 --> 01:27:52,807
but yeah that does make sense

639
01:27:53,253 --> 01:28:08,141
I like I would probably really love a 60%
keyboard my fingers are not long enough to
do really intense I've noticed it on the
laptop that has 60% or 70% like that imma
let imma let imma let better

640
01:28:08,143 --> 01:28:15,118
yeah I'm a lot faster I have noticed that
certain so that that might be something I
would consider

641
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:22,787
hey I got coal I just go kill something and
then I'll go to bed

642
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:29,526
find the pillar set a roach or a girl
stretch

643
01:28:29,526 --> 01:28:37,296
wait where's Roach any toll roads account
number

644
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:45,944
I can't do that yeah yeah I like to hear
your keyboard on his eye yeah

645
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:52,878
Rush where are you dude you make me run the
whole way

646
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:59,636
you aren't you I don't like fastrax there's
a lot of people use special said you not
like them

647
01:29:02,385 --> 01:29:08,375
they're your buddy all right let's go

648
01:29:11,797 --> 01:29:18,871
yeah I think you're right I think is my
right shoulder does sometimes have trouble
so that makes a lot of sense actually

649
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:28,485
my heart's time should be going down I'm on
the Strode

650
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:49,307
I don't understand it should be taking a
horse out of town because we're on the road

651
01:29:57,097 --> 01:30:00,055
