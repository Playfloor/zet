1
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:37,928
hi there I go in a bit I'm actually making
coffee making coffee

2
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,308
all right

3
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:04,632
I got to come so tonight we're going to have
is to make a is to create a melting point

4
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:12,618
hours to create an additional volume
additional files are some additional disc on

5
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:20,261
these new virtual machines to get created
where he done it once or going to use
normally we just have disk for this

6
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:27,940
but what I want to do is see if there is a
way

7
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:35,345
to do it with the vagrant file disk
directive

8
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:43,019
so if we go we got discontinued all right

9
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:46,564
have a look at Thanksgiving duration

10
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:53,341
this time zone

11
00:04:53,945 --> 00:05:01,763
this DVD floppy this is new by the way he's
such a pain in the provider we have we know
that some

12
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,092
virtualbox provider provides all this

13
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:13,805
and yeah we were able to do all this

14
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:26,305
yeah that's interesting

15
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,306
I understand what I just meant I didn't have
to provide the file and it just made it
automatically

16
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:46,922
as interesting you and so

17
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:54,474
and I want to see if we can actually cause
it to format

18
00:05:54,534 --> 00:06:01,428
don't think that's because something we can
do through the through it vacant Rosanna
Couture do that for the Proviso provide
provisioning

19
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,370
it was his response was the following
categories for the best the best you can do

20
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:16,555
is 2 it's kind of loud music

21
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:27,942
how's it going I'm in Lenox welcome so

22
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:33,859
I don't want to sound to something for you
at the sound there

23
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:57,274
so it's so basically what we would be doing
is dealing with discs and

24
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,341
I want to know if they did take it to the

25
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:07,321
do you work out of Hickory the file system
that runs on the disc

26
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:14,909
configure discipline of disrespect to the
reader right action of this metafile are you
did

27
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:16,849
oh that's nice

28
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:25,576
yeah it's it's pretty fun if you're on Linux
you probably know more about NFS than I do
it's been a long time since it's an
interface I'm done it since the 90s

29
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:29,591
so are you familiar with vagrant

30
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:36,106
pickets for provisioning virtual machines
dynamically

31
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:43,239
this pedophile both built-in disc actions if
he's going to just expect to be read right

32
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:52,103
inside the machines dated rectory keep track
of the last configured steak for decillion
brighter

33
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:57,733
I forgot my sweater maker that uses the file
to see what this work to figure to last run

34
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:07,223
oh yeah we need to play with that Tony while
I really want to play with that I get 10 if
this stuff finishing tomorrow I'm going to
be doing that a lot

35
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:12,065
we should talk about that oh my gosh

36
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,800
yeah well we should

37
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:33,881
a real to send a note and you weren't able
to tap into it and send him a reference to
it it's nice if it is no longer verify like
can be assumed they just kind of over there
hey how's it going

38
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,813
manticore

39
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:48,473
it's going to be required for provider help
her with virtualbox reserve a car needs a
way to help you track with your find a
Spanish word vagrant

40
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,558
and are you IDs

41
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,344
Panabaker

42
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:06,042
when you do it when you do answer will stuff
do you how do you provision of EMS we've
been talking a lot about that

43
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:13,931
I thought seriously about doing that but
vagrants to do everything I want one shot
right

44
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,895
anthem of the sea right I understand I just
don't know how

45
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:23,065
reminder name

46
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:31,187
size primary name file

47
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:35,996
discount extension of charger that has what
kind of file extension have

48
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:55,321
okay I think I got everything all right so
I'm actually good news because you see how
hard it is to practice provisioning a hard
drive with fdisk this is so fun Amelie huge
for education

49
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:02,076
and I'm not sure why I didn't really Embrace
this more before

50
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:17,012
because this allows me to do things that are
just like totally taboo and dangerous
anywhere else that can't be done with
containers so this is definitely a huge huge
tool vagrant Vigor to like vagrant

51
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:22,911
I'm starting to think that big run is Benson
tastic

52
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:26,732
hint after stocks are good yeah

53
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:37,848
you know them all nice thank you here we're
going to try to keep it fun in 2020 be doing
a lot of planning for 20 20 20 22 coming up
here

54
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:54,815
oh that's nice of said to say that I
appreciate it so let me let me show you
something this is at this point I am really
seriously thinking about

55
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:59,818
adding this and I in a serious way

56
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:09,246
is it let me let me go ahead and run this
vagrant up so here's a necrophile

57
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:49,367
and just a recap for everybody have to make
sure to export bigger experimental this is
what I was losing before there are two
different ways the old way and the new way
for provisioning disk through vagrant the
new way uses the really awesome disc thing
this year but it doesn't work without
exploiting his experimental it works fine
but it's listed as experimental and he noted
that way there's another way to do it but
you have to do like you have to make calls
to the provider which is kind of a pain in
the butt but you can do it

58
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,787
and so this says this is this Loop for a
permission so different

59
00:11:55,787 --> 00:12:11,141
workers this is actually really good and
Ruby Syntax for the scything and here's
where we defend everything and we're pulling
down the same M8 which I understand is the
best bet and red hat Enterprise non Red Hat
red hat

60
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:14,536
and then we have the hostname to them and
give him a virtualbox

61
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:21,841
I'll give him CPR memory and disc and the
disk is not under the provider Loop

62
00:12:21,392 --> 00:13:13,608
hi how's it going so and then this is I
can't tell you how valuable this is because
by doing this I can provision one 10 or 20
different discs and I can I could set those
disks have been in a raid 5 simulation I
could do whatever I wanted to I can create
raw Blockhead block devices for a database
if I wanted to test it that way and sitting
sitting up discs and praising him in
virtualbox is not an easy task using the
gooey you can do it right but it's it's very
complicated this is so much easier this way
you can kind of script into the says give
and give if the if the note is control give
it a 10 MB it's the really small so I can
fill it up and see what happens when it gets
too full and then go ahead and and run the
provision script on everything

63
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:40,340
and the provision script is is here going to
turn swap off just cuz we don't need it and
this is going to go ahead and sell the NFS
utils because we're going to put in if
that's on your eventually but we're also
going to automatically format and place a
file system on the disk volume that we just
attached and I'll do that now so

64
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:44,881
house for sale get it provisioning so any
regular up

65
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:58,646
oh I left a comment I like him a lot he's
never once treated me but I really love him

66
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:06,885
it's time to go that way I'm just a
small-time friends well

67
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:25,847
alright so let's go ahead and but I'm just
sitting up

68
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,259
I forgot my coffee I'm going to pack

69
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:45,598
yeah I forgot I Mike I definitely did so
it's like

70
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:55,195
I love this is this this Stillness of the
software is being created

71
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,404
what they mean by infrastructure as
codestructures code

72
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:11,786
you know it it's actually running

73
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:21,575
we look to run the run some code and to
actually make to make virtual machines or
simulated Hardware

74
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:25,773
and that's a big deal it's like a really big
deal

75
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:34,252
so you know you can't escape learning how to
code coding is everywhere it really is you
know

76
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:52,251
and what are you whether you're like a
terminal junkie like us or you just doing
something else

77
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:59,646
the steps at this coat is doing to create
these were some issues for us pretty amazing

78
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:32,975
I just think this is a nominal I know it
looks boring but you have no idea how cool I
think this is

79
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:47,749
I am here because this is going to let us
test using some of the most dangerous
commands known to Lenox and I'm not talking
about our msrf I'm talking about things like
Didi and fdisk scary scary commands

80
00:18:55,536 --> 00:19:00,745
I wonder I wonder if Will is running if we
could kind of be kind of the hood

81
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:19,998
I want to and it writes in here are this
machines right control there's our machines

82
00:19:27,694 --> 00:19:29,928
what are these things

83
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:53,414
why is Yuki scary scary Jack idea he's one
of the few commands you can totally nuke
your break your computer. Break it you can
not the reason for my entire hard drive you
cancel this break your heart right now
depends on the NBA already know how much you
can restore from that and if you need it the
master boot record

84
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:09,428
I recovered this before by grabbing an NBR
off another disk and rewriting it to another
disk secret is to survive so then we are 144
B I think the beginning of every disc

85
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:19,089
if you happen to be are in a the B used to
be the boot record from this I think that
some of that discard to texture is change
then point I was trying to make is that

86
00:20:19,089 --> 00:21:11,306
experimenting with this architecture is
extremely dangerous and time-consuming on
hardware and that's how I learned we had to
get old disks write and I'd have my chassis
open on my table and I'm plugging in a new
you know old school ID driving before scuzzy
right we can plug in a new ribbon cable I
plug the drive-in and I'd fuck around with
Dad and I try to get to reformat it and then
I would then I would break it and I'll get
another disc going to put that in there and
I try to get that was how you that was how
you messed around with with learning how to
provision disc in and formatted and copy it
off and everything that was steps I did it
it if you wanted to experiment with Linux
and get you know dirty and down and dirty
with some of the more dangerous commands it
involve disk space and Ayo and and stuff
like that you had to do it with Hardware

87
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:16,394
and so a lot of Linux people from my
generation had Hardware everywhere

88
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:23,859
with Hardware I still have I still have
probably 15 IDE drive just sitting in a
drawer

89
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:33,236
yeah yeah if you can imagine I was so mad
Dragon 2000 actually have the box I bought
Mandrake in a box

90
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:35,930
so

91
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:42,259
how's it going off so don't you have the
back then the back then you had to play

92
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:55,048
then you had to play with Hardware in order
to test all this stuff and now now I can run
a script I mean seriously how fucking cool
is it that I can resist taking longer than
usual I'm wondering why there is Serenity
way

93
00:21:55,696 --> 00:22:03,626
I guess not what's an Oculus

94
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:09,539
Mandrake with Susie yeah

95
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:18,843
Dalek it was just hard to read news on
German all right so then we go so there when
I work or two is to taking longer than usual

96
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,606
this virtualbox it definitely takes longer
than

97
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:30,959
then then they delivered drivers but it's
more popular in mainstream

98
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:56,450
alright so so now what are we doing

99
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:05,936
I'm going to go get some

100
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:15,928
okay so here's the here's the part that's
terrifying okay there's a couple commands
that are you should to be to have a healthy
respect for

101
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:38,303
Lenox right I mean everybody uses are
disrupting her for Dad and Dede they've
heard about that they've never heard of that
if desk right this another one of those
commands that you should be we should have
healthy healthy skepticism are healthy and I
don't you don't want to just throw the Three
Stooges around so what's the first things
first let's do a loop here

102
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:53,745
and we're going to run this is a little one
liner that says run lsblk which list all the
blocks of ice has those are disk volume to
Tash devices to on the entire thing and I
want to show you the at the

103
00:23:53,746 --> 00:24:02,095
as you can see this one has I hate it does
this morning I wonder if he can tell the
wake-up vagrant to do not do the warnings

104
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,127
owner says I can afford a car to turn off
the warnings

105
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:20,242
same old vagrant experimental

106
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:24,839
Brinks makes it hard to read

107
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,213
I guess so

108
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:41,441
recent photos back if you use to name every
single Smirnoff he shook his head Flygon

109
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:47,497
if you want me to do that Healdsburg future
1 and teacher 2

110
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:54,956
cloud in it enable this feature allows users
to use cloud in a future more information on
this

111
00:24:55,894 --> 00:25:04,885
McKenzie providers and it was feature will
allow bigger to manage configuration too
sweet to that type triggers

112
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:11,600
I don't know I wonder how I can get it to

113
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:19,555
Icelandair picture a certification to
package

114
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:22,362
I need to get rid of it

115
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:33,314
I wonder if it writes it just it out I said
Aaron let's try

116
00:25:34,197 --> 00:25:38,509
I asked you to go see your dental

117
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:42,869
and net-net take care of it

118
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:52,067
I mean wait let me try something else here
so that got rid of the errors also I had a
feeling Q is going to do it

119
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:58,899
I hope it does anyway guess not hairless
two-man vagrant

120
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:07,333
oh how you doing drugs have drafix

121
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:18,237
yeah I slept love having you all here so
this is to do there is no flag

122
00:26:18,238 --> 00:26:22,139
that's too bad I can help without

123
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:26,703
I can hope without her friend autocomplete
cut a straight Hall to help and then login

124
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:35,397
operator resume I should have suspended box
that has just spent upload validate version

125
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:41,684
he is just version I think that's for bows

126
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:49,598
any online interactive output no TTY

127
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:58,363
enable debug output yeah alright fine I'll
go back to her

128
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:05,965
our humble redirect to re-direct Avenue and
Lisa Rosen don't know that God

129
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:14,327
I mean to standard out standard are lots of
people then they won't do that so this is
what I wanted to show

130
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:45,649
hey so this is Cesar the three systems
there's you know we have control and then we
have work or one or two he knows that
control has an SD be on here but it doesn't
have any petitions on it yet because it's a
volume has been created as I said in the old
days I would have to wipe a disc and plug it
in to get that hey how's it going to kiss
your python was Django I don't use either
I'm not suit a suitable person to talk to
about that

131
00:27:45,738 --> 00:28:00,976
yeah I don't use those Savages go for any of
that I don't I don't I just don't know I'm
not saying don't use it I just don't know
and we haven't talked to somebody else who
uses that kind of stuff

132
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:35,659
night so let's let's do this, but this is
the fun part so we can use Bakery SSH to
connect to the control box which is the one
that's got the the volume on it right I mean
lsblk to show the blocked devices right so
another reason for doing this is let's say
let's say you don't want to try all this
stuff and you wanted to learn Linux write
what you can do all of these commands and
learn them in a virtual machine without
hurting anybody

133
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:41,313
iheartraves container how did you fantastic

134
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:43,835
is rajamanickam

135
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:52,511
do you mind if I put that really kind, and
in my in my nice things file I'm going to
anyway

136
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:59,599
the keeps me running mccd

137
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:10,753
I do I have a I have a file that I keep that
just makes me happy because God knows I'm
taking shit from people

138
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:22,376
principal telling you make entire videos
about all the reasons you shouldn't do
anything I say and then I'm going to ruin
your life if you follow me and

139
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:28,071
I've never seen you like more than an hour
of my videos

140
00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:36,047
whatever we got to learn to live without
worrying about those people right

141
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:47,074
I mean I'm going to I'll jump that out 2 2 2
2 2

142
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:56,445
it's very cool that you're doing that stuff
yeah we're going to do some zettelkasten
stuff tomorrow

143
00:29:57,945 --> 00:30:05,536
paragon nice

144
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:12,385
hey man. I put it in here cuz you're very
quiet I clicked on your link it didn't go
there

145
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:20,311
I don't know why but I think she's busted
add

146
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:35,573
is it in Brazil oh yeah

147
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:54,846
I love Brazil Nevaeh Paula Ferrari is like
one of my Heroes that you know this is a
thing we can we have Heroes when I say that
I'm Apollo for is my hero I do not approve
of his misogynistic anti-women rhetoric was
in the sixties when he wrote that book

148
00:30:54,849 --> 00:31:02,370
I don't when you say as soon as you're here
that doesn't necessarily mean you approve of
everything you did I also think Martin
Luther King is a fantastic human being and a
great person to emulate

149
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:08,823
person to emulate and be a hero he's also a
Serial adulterer you know so I just want to
put that out there because I'm afraid people

150
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:29,639
I think that we can hear worship certain
people based on the good that they've done
and try to we can't forget the bad that
they've done because we will repeat it you
know but at the same time I think we should
focus on what people try as hard as you can
to do to focus mostly on the good and
goddamn fairy is done a lot of amazing
things

151
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:35,817
what do you think I'm going to just like
containers over like b a c

152
00:31:41,053 --> 00:32:02,789
I can't speak to that directly I don't have
any direct information on that the biggest
Advantage is that they won interns employed
on billions if not trillions of different
containerized engines right now and
orchestration Frameworks so that's the
advantage advantages that is when you say
container today

153
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:11,284
99.9% of everybody who hears the word
container today think cellex-c that is the
biggest single advantage

154
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,895
so

155
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:23,810
that's a pretty substantial one alright so
here's the really fun things we get to do
this it here's a funky man so it was a
command call fdisk right

156
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:40,528
and what if this does is it takes a raw bit
of volume space so it's actually it warms my
heart to see fda's by the way sdarcc devices

157
00:32:40,823 --> 00:33:14,350
right either schedule devices or there say
to a devices or let you know but you didn't
used to csda in DC this nvme shit right you
know about that right and if you run this
command on on any modern system is got it
like that block storage I mean it's got like
SSD you get this right and by the way this
is why people fucking hate snap like that it
melts all this packages is a root device
stupid is that so stupid loopback devices

158
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:20,263
I can't even write it yeah I can never
remember it

159
00:33:20,263 --> 00:34:04,130
I look at it and I'm like what and give me
zero and blah blah blah and they got this
crazy I mean it's not as cool as you know
and then he's like really modest SDA there's
my media drive right so this is my USB stick
that's plugged in so it warms my heart to
see SDA because FDA, is the way it used to
be used to be that you know that really
basic things in your head so that so lsblk
shows you all the devices on your system as
a relatively modern thing and let's be okay
with not around when I didn't Unix before
why don't you remember how he's doing we we
would do after such a l l s is also a Linux
command I think

160
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:06,940
and if you're on a Mac you can't do these
that all

161
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:14,765
if that's that she'll know I had to do his
route which I also thought maybe we could
probably leave from Prague

162
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:21,392
right there you go so this is this is a much
easier way to do the same thing

163
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:28,704
and empty at this cuz it's pretty old
program and it's going to happen to know so
I'm going to use it

164
00:34:28,762 --> 00:35:29,950
so again I am on this extra machine here so
I can do things that I normally would not do
it actually what I'm about to do is really
fun if you're new to Lenox because we're
actually going to provision our own hard
drive from the command line I mean I'm sorry
I will file system and that's what if this
does an in-form ask the file system to
accept any number of different different
about any kind of file system we want on
there right now it's just raw storage blocks
or so to the she has to do has to do I have
to ask and he has appointed to the device s
d a b Wright dentist that's a petition has
different work and do that you can sub
partition to put your file systems on there
and everything and we'll do that eventually
but right now it is it is any of this you
have this is fdisk command this command is
super scary and dangerous because if you
point it at your hard drive and you do the
wrong thing and you had the partition table
completely you could

165
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:42,025
Wheatley wipe your just now you have to just
ways of recovering stuff on your disk of
course but in terms of like getting the
exact file system back you can have a real
hard time with that so you can put it in for
help and you can look around all the
different commands

166
00:35:41,254 --> 00:36:30,674
all the different commands and you can see
that there's no print out this menu change
the display enter units extra functionality
extra functionality is pretty crazy you can
like you know toggle that bit of old desks
and stuff and things like that but this this
command expects you to have pretty low-level
knowledge of file systems and I know what
they are about and how to use them and which
one to put on there and most people who jump
into fdisk when they first get going they
don't have any idea and they can create all
kinds of problems I don't know what kind of
file system put on there and it didn't know
whether the issue is NTFS or they should use
the xt2 and different so let me show me by
all the different file system you can pick
from where is it set

167
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:40,249
don't just lay out to SF describe that's new
load this cloud from acceptance for file
that's new I don't remember those

168
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:45,958
I can missing some options here yeah here we
go so generic

169
00:36:46,319 --> 00:37:18,041
so changed a little bit rated memory say it
different if you need a bail I think you
could control see out of here if you get
scared you know if you if you accidentally
did Dave SDA it would be a bad thing but
these days your main drives probably going
to be in Via me so pretty clear that you're
not going to be working on that top of the
beautiful flag you need to turn a beautiful
flag on if you're going to make a bootable
in NBR and this is what's going to be our
Taco Bell

170
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:21,592
I mean yeah this works for bac2

171
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:38,251
delete a partition list of free partitions
Listen to Partition types add a new petition
for partition table changes verify the
partition table so we're partitioning disk
using command line you can probably use it
as a graphic tool for doing this

172
00:37:38,700 --> 00:38:23,710
I forget the name of it gparted I know it
must look at see what your part is I don't
you can't read you part of cuz I don't have
Graphics that's right once again command
line for the rescue so let's list all the
predictions are they are so here's all the
different partition types and any one of
these partitions can be made it which is
really cool because you can actually
stimulate I grabbing a disc from somebody
else and installing it that way we're not
going to that we're going to stick with easy
stuff you got that Windows 95 a 32A I asked
fat16 got these are old Us in here now

173
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:28,502
did they had butterface Rufus got everyone
that was huge

174
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:34,052
I look they have like hexadecimal numbers
now because they got

175
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:41,553
there's a bunch of new ones I haven't I
haven't seen before

176
00:38:41,554 --> 00:38:46,567
yeah this is much anyways I'm kind of its
kind of fun because I haven't used it in a
long time

177
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:58,630
so I'm going to go up here and look at some
of the other ones I have Xanax extended
Lenox and Lenox Swap this is pretty much the
standard where free to pick

178
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:12,242
I think when he said his EXT2 it'll it'll
default to the right thing and I'll do some
the next one but if you wanted to change it

179
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:15,849
where are using virtual box from vagrant

180
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:23,267
you definitely definitely want virtualbox
and vagrant then or you can use live Birds

181
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:39,099
he's delivered for that too but I'm sitting
sitting at volumes and liver and chemo is
totally different than River box so I use
virtualbox without the graphics and that's
what I'm doing right now

182
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:47,600
XT XT 2 3 yeah I used to be better if I
don't see better on here did you see it

183
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:54,949
I'm trying I'm trying to see if I'm trying
to see if they added it as one of the
Sanders ones that you can add you know

184
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,847
I don't see it I see if my

185
00:39:57,847 --> 00:40:04,526
maybe as a secret name hfss is Mac this is
the Mac 1

186
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:20,701
NTFS it is if you the only time you ever
have to do this is if you wanted to create a
disc volume that could be loaded into
Windows without a problem as well and then
you can plug it into Windows or or when

187
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:34,577
GFS I haven't looked at the fs at all I
heard good things but I haven't again I
haven't been in this low-level in a while so
I go back and forth between low-level and

188
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:40,446
yeah between low-level and yellow old school
stuff

189
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:48,666
Advanced VMware View FS vmfs that's
interesting I can put it on there

190
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:54,028
a bar with Arch that's pretty common I sent
Beauty

191
00:40:56,047 --> 00:41:01,332
GSL I don't see it I don't see it under the
standard here

192
00:41:03,952 --> 00:41:11,316
what is what is the is it is it listen after
school or is it to New 4 ft ask and I wonder

193
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:22,950
btrfs I don't see it

194
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:37,017
yeah I don't see it here I don't see this in
a list

195
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:47,687
yeah I would never use better if that's
anything serious it really no need to

196
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:55,505
but if it says it's rebuilding backups
that's what that's why people love it until
it doesn't work

197
00:41:57,008 --> 00:42:08,164
I could do a logical volume manager so they
have it in this case you don't want that
this case I just want raw disc because I
just want to fill it and and tested and
stuff so I want to test out a different
volume

198
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:15,298
so anyway we can we can pick out those
things

199
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:49,312
yeah if you have been experienced is fine I
don't deal with this every day most
beginners wouldn't want him so really all we
want to do here if you want to create a new
Partition right so you can press M to figure
out how to do that again if you need to and
we're going to listen let's listen to free
unpartition space it's always fun capital F
so this this is all the free sectors and
they're listed in blocks which 512 B and as
I understand it blocks used to make up you
know

200
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:57,407
different sections of the disc but that's a
different thing now I know why they've been
measuring it if I told B for a very long
time

201
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:02,410
sectors of 1512 by

202
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:07,908
so start and end so this is

203
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,558
right now

204
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:22,333
the amount free is 9 MB so they must have
written some stuff at the beginning of the
disk partition and so it's left out some
stuff for us

205
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:27,460
it's in the phone previously I think it is
to you that your first I've heard about that
one too

206
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:50,001
so we we we are going to make a new a new
position so if you get afraid you don't
remember what it is going to go. I do this
already so you like my thing is if you
screwed up you didn't break anything it's
just a file yeah because it's virtual it's
just a file that's what in the files acting
as if it's a disk drive and so if you screw
it up you just redo it

207
00:43:50,623 --> 00:44:17,311
I can't tell you I've said that many times
already tonight and overstayed how cool that
is so the partition table this is the scary
command this is a command that when you to a
p it actually writes it to the partition
table and from that moment on that disk is
you committed a verify print information
about a partition add a new Partition so
let's do a new one and we're going to make a
new primary petition

208
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:25,337
honest this cuz it's a raw device me to call
British number one and we're going to use
all of the disc

209
00:44:25,338 --> 00:45:02,388
I have four sectors and beginning the last
sector is the end if you wanted to chop the
disc up you could do that now we don't
really need to do that because we just could
add a new device in vagra right if you if
you'd only reason you never want to chop up
an existing physical hard drive is if it was
an existing physical aren't ripe if it if
you're doing virtualization you can read
signs your hard drives for those devices get
attached virtually to your answer the
controller and then to your machine your
virtual machine is so you can size that hard
drive by by pretending to change their
physical size instead of

210
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:32,039
instead of having to chop them up dealing
with a chopped-up partition unless you
really really have to do that is not fun
usually is when I accepted a false nail to
get really into this if you ever make your
own artifices I mean Arch if you ever want
to you know get into the down-and-dirty
suffused into or Arch and building earlier
Lennox and scratching to get really into
this down and dirty detail but right now I
just want to add a new one so it's going to
hit enter create a new Partition one of type
Lennox of size 9 men

211
00:45:32,100 --> 00:46:27,073
and and now we need to print it so for
pushpe a prince it was a type of person to a
110 W is right sorry I love you is right.
He's the dangerous one of these W and it
doesn't warn you it just does it so now we
have a new Partition Deb s t b h d d
chopping matters yeah I think you're
probably right if you're doing if using
actual physical drives course nothing about
it at partitioning isn't important thing to
understand is that you can pretend to have
an actual thing and end partition it up the
way you want it takes care of the primary
disc for you automatically so you don't have
to do that but yeah and there's a number of
things you can try you can actually try to
do a dual boot that be kind of fun actually

212
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:37,933
any kind of fun to play with and see if you
can make a machine to dual boot in machine
from drugs for virtualbox and have it prompt
you out and grab that fast I mean I have it
from you and grab to do something

213
00:46:38,514 --> 00:47:39,042
have you weird and be funny and weird at the
same time anyway just cuz you want a bunch
of machines ice Nefertiti learning how to
install Linux it's it's not for that if you
want to do that just get yourself an old
machine and just practice reimaging it
constantly and dealing with the BIOS and
stuff because those are things you have to
understand if you want to install your own
mini my name is a plug for this is, coming
up on a long-term calendar we're going to
talk about all the stuff in great detail
during the infrastructure engineering boost
I'm sorry that's only 6 weeks of boost but
we're definitely going to talk about how to
install Linux on Hardware how to provision
stuff in Virtual machines what's
virtualization with containerization how
should you run your own home lab how to
setup your own net working at home all day
at the basics Westrate 5 that kind of thing
all the basics of just an infrastructure
with regard to Lenox and then that can kind
of

214
00:47:39,051 --> 00:48:34,860
build on your knowledge of the command line
you learn for the boots everything so that's
that's the goal anyway hey how's it going to
bust your chops and I mean I'm going to
that's my goal and that's my goal I can't
promise I'm going to be able to make it but
that's that's my goal right now so so here
we've got a new a new thing now if we do
Ellis be okay now it'll look different so
now we have we have our SD be about a
primary disc of a device that's what this is
and two devices to this device's volume so
everyone called and universities this this
one is using Lan so that's the logical
volume manager which allows you to do some
fancy stuff with this by allocating extra
long story short allows you to resize a disk
it's already been created he didn't have
that you have to destroy the whole disk and
make a new one or get you some fancy tool
that lets you shrink it

215
00:48:37,181 --> 00:49:21,561
so now we have a 9 MB partition called part
at has no Mount Point currently because and
that means we can't do anything with it it's
not melted is not is no way to access it
right soon so now we have to add up or did
you know the reason I'm going through this
is because these are steps that I definitely
am going to want a script and I don't
underst ripped it up to ask for so I mean it
would be silly to do so so I need to I need
to like think about that for a second
because I need to strip that but let's go
through and do the mail Point process and
then we'll come back and see what how much
of the stuff could be could be scripted

216
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:29,651
alright so first things first

217
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:38,627
all right let's go out to wait what's up

218
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:51,933
all right I do see this is same

219
00:49:52,728 --> 00:50:07,757
we need to mount it so we could just get
really cheap and dirty and make him out
point so make make directory why it's been
so long since I've done this and I call NFS
it doesn't matter what you calling

220
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:21,205
and if that's stuff is generally mounted
stuff generally goes in / I meant a sentence
using t o p t doesn't matter

221
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:25,022
this is going to be hard though because

222
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:31,491
I know I know I don't know how this is going
to

223
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:49,986
and it's going to work at 3 or not we're
going to find out so the old school way of
doing this it's just too basic mount it
because it's a really easy Mount we can
assume all of the false I think it's going
to ring mount a read-only so we're going to
try it so we're going to mount Dev

224
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:57,105
SS db-21 on m n t n f s

225
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,268
and Larry can do that course

226
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:14,291
I got to spend so long people can laugh at
me all the time and I cannot remember my
commands wrong if this site bad superblock
icv missing code page

227
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:21,978
I'm doing it backwards that's super block I
don't think I can do this

228
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:27,705
am I doing that made it wrong I got a bad
superblock

229
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:35,451
how do I got to do to get backwards I think
I might have done it backwards

230
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:41,260
is CB1 how I did

231
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:49,506
yeah I'm doing it wrong so we need to figure
out how to do this I know it can be done I'm
just doing it wrong

232
00:51:51,124 --> 00:51:55,839
and see her locked it's good it's okay for
me to figure out again

233
00:51:57,336 --> 00:52:02,944
Mount CB 1

234
00:52:05,718 --> 00:52:11,362
Integrity of this type how's it going at
this time

235
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:18,654
I don't think it's it's allowing me to do
the defaults having a read up on it

236
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:22,588
mounting new Drive

237
00:52:28,026 --> 00:52:34,920
I wonder if it's because I have to do it
over so I have to make it a one of the one
of the Virtual Drive types

238
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,492
I think I might have to make it one of the
Virtual Drive types

239
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:51,685
yeah I think I do I think I might have to I
think I might have to use one of the lever
to file systems from VMware

240
00:52:56,931 --> 00:53:03,110
Tennessee a we didn't have to squeeze it
already

241
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:11,409
can you change display switch off this guy.
Compatibility mode

242
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,506
preposition

243
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:22,444
I'm pretty sure I should be pretty someone
help me get in and we did that already

244
00:53:22,445 --> 00:53:26,273
I don't think it needs a boot sector has it

245
00:53:26,274 --> 00:53:33,522
I shouldn't have fish it needed she needed
me or anything because it's not booting it's
like why isn't love a supermarket

246
00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:42,839
fingerless person makes me selfish crazy
like spouses to melt Point yeah oh we forgot
to format it

247
00:53:43,335 --> 00:53:50,671
I just worry about it I totally forgot to
format it

248
00:53:50,672 --> 00:53:55,764
yam we need this that's what this is

249
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:59,536
right

250
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:07,485
it was $60 at the label on the kitchen
device this is also going to mount it I
think

251
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:22,383
yeah this is normally this is cool to do
this by hand because I've gotten so soft in
this shit this stuff is is this is all stuff
that is done automatically by so many
systems this is why people like Arch because
our forces them to learn all these

252
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:33,157
forces and you learn all these like hard
things I'm at Lenox and remember how to do
them then like I don't need to build my own
computer and I'm fine thank you going to get
busy coding and doing other stuff

253
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:49,262
all right so we are creating a file system
on

254
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:57,024
overhead press likes to put his desperation
to have any just installed it's visible

255
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:09,159
how to create a false assumption is to make
issues that I make it fast I can text you
for now this is the kind of thing that we
would have to do with

256
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:39,434
where to know the the type of 64 is the kind
of file system you want on there so I mean
if she for is the standard for Lennox these
days it has journaling and everything so
it's the right way to go do an oversized
environment first absolutely I think you
know what I think that's a great
recommendation I think people should try to
install large but but one of the things you
could actually do using virtualbox

257
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:49,390
I'm pretty sure I can we got to try that I
bet I've been using just being box managed
you could actually create a volume and boot
that volume

258
00:55:50,278 --> 00:55:53,303
you could probably start with a volume

259
00:55:53,687 --> 00:56:28,230
and you could download an ISO image and you
can mount it using VM box and you can
actually do the installation all entirely
were actually of course that kind of thing
is you know not something that you would
want to do I don't know if you would get the
full experience though because you wouldn't
really deal with bio stuff again so if you
truly want an experience you need to get a
piece of Hardware old machine or something
like that and and do it that way because

260
00:56:28,747 --> 00:56:31,834
they're just too much they're just too much
going on

261
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:48,997
all right so are we doing we are we are
creating a new brand new volume in order to
run manafest on a vagrant virtualbox

262
00:56:49,023 --> 00:56:55,484
the native not virtual yeah because lazy
people are leaving quickly

263
00:56:55,732 --> 00:57:01,706
yeah it doesn't have working environment
here so try to fix it or set up yeah

264
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:04,276
start with Native

265
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:29,925
yes what is the thing okay so it depends
what your goal is people ask me what your
favorite little sister on Mike all depends
on your goals if you if you want I like to
struggle through it and learn its shit ton
about Lennox and art your hardware and how
things work you know are charged into him
like that but that's not for me if you just
want something that works and if you think
of you know you want to fight about when do
managers then you know you got any kind of
user there

266
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:36,400
all right so we're going to go ahead and do
this command

267
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:41,800
which is another command I think I can do
for the command line I'm have to do this
though

268
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:49,612
and we're going to mount this on m n t n f s

269
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:52,319
sgv 1

270
00:57:52,455 --> 00:58:53,525
and we need to do the one again is the first
partition of the volume the volume is stb
and let's see if that runs our our stuff
yeah now you see how it's wrote the super
blocking before I try them out and said I
have no idea there was a super block okay
well now it it knows what that is in
superblock is just a part of the file system
that's the part of the very beginning of the
following system is has what type of file
system it is so where do you mount can
figure stuff out and then you have to melt
the file system on top of a mountain point
and this isn't exactly really cool about
Linux amount Point by the way if your hacker
this is a great way to hide should you eat
what you can't hide it from other hackers or
anybody who knows anything about Lenox butt
butt to the average person you can mount
something over the top of something that's
already there so if you do that in a CD into
it they want to see that there's something
about to go over at hiding it it's kind of a
cool little trick you can do that the only
fools like really simple simple people that
are be coming in to see your stuff but it's
also be careful because

271
00:58:53,533 --> 00:59:02,307
you might accidentally mount on the top of
something you didn't want to hide and all of
a sudden he's been up at skating in you
can't you can't get to it anymore so just

272
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:58,817
so just purifier that so that's why we had
to make a directory we made an empty
directory in m n t s f s s o y m n t is kind
of a standard place to put these things so
that they don't confuse people another
common place to mount would be / home so
like if we had if in fact I've considered
doing this if your head up multi user
environment and you wanted to have lots and
lots of systems that shared a home directory
it's a very very common thing in a Linux
multi-user world with to have like multiple
machines and everybody can log into any back
in the day when we used to distribute load
the load of users like thousands of users
right then we would say okay here's to 15 or
20 Union Station so you know Linux machines
and every single one of them is as / home
mounted against an NFS Drive

273
00:59:58,822 --> 01:00:58,736
and so every time one of those machines
comes online it in terms of the home
directory it's identical to all the other
ones and that's where you get AT&T password
got the star in it for passwords that used
to read the information for login identity
from something called and is I don't know if
niss still use I haven't looked at it a ten
is an NFS for a very long time probably
since the 90s and then I'm kind of
revisiting this is why I'm doing it but it
usually and is NFS go together and I don't
see anybody interested in NIS lately and see
me talking about but there's nothing but
these are locking systems are not a thing
anymore it's not a thing anymore everybody's
got their own container don't need a multi
user login system made it back in the day
that was my mission only because we used to
melt / home on all of those machines and
then every single user has the same user ID
and when they would come out of the system
and they didn't care or what

274
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:48,548
machine was right because they're home
directory was the same no matter what
machine they attached to an end that's
that's still think so I do want to look at
identity management in using ldap some the
modern techniques are out there to create
like a jump box for multiple users to go
into your kubernetes cluster or something
like that but I don't I'm not going to focus
on that right now right now I just want to
focus on getting my manifest up if we did
this right then do you have should show that
we now have a mounted partition when we
haven't met her yet week we have the ability
to mount it but we haven't found any yet we
probably have an entry in the in the in the
we have an FSM entry we should probably have
an entry in the fs have entry now for

275
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:54,967
amenti we don't yet we don't have an issue
here we might have to add one

276
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:00,300
this is what tells you to melt things by
default right

277
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:13,559
all the stuff I'm doing by the way is stuff
that can be added automatically you so I'm
just going through the amount that commands
so just remind myself so let's make a lemon
tea

278
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:20,379
n f s I should it should melt now

279
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:27,046
I hope stb-1 m n t

280
01:02:27,046 --> 01:02:28,912
Anna Faris

281
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:39,641
cerium all right yay now we do if we get our
a CB and it's 3% filled at 3% filled

282
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:48,407
it's already 3% filled MB in it and it's
already 3% filled what the hell is in there

283
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,024
we're going to go in there and look

284
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:58,488
I was just lost and found so it snowed is it
pretty out there

285
01:02:58,643 --> 01:03:13,925
oh my God we got this wonderful snowy
Wonderland going on I should go to go film
it so this is something that is a good
memory you see how it says lost and found in
there not sorry no you're in a root of a
volume

286
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,569
can I do gets lost

287
01:03:19,181 --> 01:03:25,992
and I know there's a file or directory or
some anything that can be written inside of
a disc if

288
01:03:30,216 --> 01:03:32,693
so yeah if you go

289
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:42,594
there's anything you're lost and found
that's a 90 days been disconnected just be a
bad idea to put stuff in this either butbut

290
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:53,027
that's cool because there's only a lost and
found at the root of a volume that's the
only place it exists and it's I think it's
only a n e x t 4

291
01:03:57,486 --> 01:04:12,924
we are good to go we are ready to head to
melt this and make it into an interface
export what you can do and then we want to
figure out how to automate these steps that
we just did so let me add these notes here
so we have it to do here to do

292
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:17,258
fdisk to

293
01:04:17,893 --> 01:04:22,594
create a Tab S T B

294
01:04:24,742 --> 01:04:42,421
1 partition then we need to do to do we need
to format it at the crater partition table
and then you have to format the partition
know I could have split up the thing to
multiple pieces that I would have run fdisk
on every one of them right format

295
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:48,573
format that partition with was it

296
01:04:50,531 --> 01:04:55,972
it was Aspen make a mess yeah

297
01:05:00,828 --> 01:05:07,648
create a mount point m n t n f s

298
01:05:08,002 --> 01:05:11,792
i mean we can see shared instead of benefits

299
01:05:13,218 --> 01:05:16,958
I see that what's a shared

300
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:23,998
is it is there a sugar Victory by default
it's not answer

301
01:05:25,806 --> 01:05:27,258
yeah

302
01:05:27,642 --> 01:05:34,987
any we could we can mount it at Route so we
can manage / whatever so that everybody can
go on to that file system right

303
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:45,862
that's a lot of people will will do it as a
still make an S drive right let's do that
I'm going to that yeah I'm going to mount it
as a test drive

304
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:50,810
Sasha is so if you want to go in there just
going to slash S

305
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:57,382
we have such as we have a slash you for the
users

306
01:05:57,712 --> 01:06:01,924
different Mount points so I'm going to do
that I'm going to do

307
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:10,404
no in my case we're going to mount it and

308
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:18,431
we're going to exporting so and then that
would be the last thing right

309
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:25,815
I forgot to Perdition yeah and to do and
then we need to export

310
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:31,940
/ s and and then we need to

311
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:39,540
and we need to wait so it's all these are
like

312
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:45,250
Jose if control

313
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:52,105
then right and I'm going to put else

314
01:06:54,076 --> 01:07:09,193
to do mounts / S I hope that it does the
control stuff first because it tries to
asynchronously provision all of these
systems the same time we can have problem
right because it's going to try

315
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:11,950
it is ever going to try to do them

316
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:23,361
and and having problems so Mount exported s
from control

317
01:07:23,597 --> 01:07:31,420
else we have a worker yeah

318
01:07:33,236 --> 01:07:40,784
all right so I'm going to do the steps here
I'm being like really were both about all
this because I kind of want to remember it

319
01:07:55,378 --> 01:07:57,847
the boy

320
01:08:09,242 --> 01:08:12,087
what are we got

321
01:08:22,653 --> 01:08:30,507
alright so let's try to try the NFL Mount
extension right here cuz we did all these
other steps listed out so

322
01:08:33,823 --> 01:08:40,906
I know we just need to added to the export
next Sports file but I want to review how to
do that

323
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:48,400
Monica reputation on their having tested
making anything here now

324
01:08:48,987 --> 01:09:16,947
the directory permissions on this a route so
at some point you might want to change that
and the default for expertise read-only in
NFS so we want to look at that to we're not
really going to care about this because
everything is going to be we're already
coordinating the user ID to cross them
across all the system to every is tar and
somebody's been tarred with a given user ID
and you don't have things ready and
assisting me what I'm talking about

325
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:19,116
so yeah

326
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:32,973
I just go ahead and look at this I say

327
01:09:34,363 --> 01:09:40,621
Touch file I'm sure we can here is something

328
01:09:42,148 --> 01:09:49,598
all right so you know it we know that you
can do stuff with it right and fill it out

329
01:09:50,238 --> 01:10:02,403
back because I really fill it up right now
and see what all kinds it must have a break
so that's what we're not actually bench with
you let's disconnect exit do we need to set
up for export first so there's the
formatting thing

330
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:12,046
I'm out just position switch is on the way
to reading someone reading

331
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:19,217
announce a mounting

332
01:10:22,112 --> 01:10:27,467
do you have to confess to a menu for finish
this is the one we were doing

333
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:33,705
god dammit

334
01:10:38,389 --> 01:10:44,138
all right so add the document I'm heading to
the read me here

335
01:10:46,363 --> 01:10:52,444
any of my reference material I'm adding here
but I'm going to remove this from the
tutorial Castle you can go look up your own

336
01:10:55,192 --> 01:10:56,871
okay

337
01:11:02,373 --> 01:11:08,758
all right Cisco Zack guy and we need to go
look up how to export

338
01:11:08,759 --> 01:11:25,135
there we go cook an FS server configuration
right at 7 p.m. of the same make directory
so we had to make a directory for the mount
Point hey how's it going doctor doctor
Marcus Rush

339
01:11:25,138 --> 01:11:41,287
we're going to do this and I'm going to edit
a text to exports we can do this one command
line but we're going to do this part and
face I forgot to add the bloodline is so it
says I want to export it to this specific IP
only

340
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:58,722
we don't want to do that though we just want
to export it to the entire network which is
fine we probably have to use a kind of a
more wide-ranging thing here

341
01:11:58,723 --> 01:12:01,794
until I find request yes

342
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:07,026
I think we disable the firewall permanently
but I'm going to be fine with that

343
01:12:08,835 --> 01:12:14,417
so let's add it to exports

344
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:25,169
export / s

345
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:34,369
2 local area network

346
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,777
you can export to just a specific machine or
just the network

347
01:12:41,765 --> 01:12:47,065
so how's it going oh my God

348
01:12:47,469 --> 01:12:50,463
variables awesome

349
01:12:53,085 --> 01:13:02,415
very awesome so I missed your call. And it
says creative campus directory to that STX
Sports

350
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,528
XX Sports

351
01:13:02,948 --> 01:13:22,517
now this is the one of the files and you can
get really fucked in if if you do not also
need to make sure your suit over there to
get hungry or ask you where your roots are
fine but you cannot have any extra spaces in
this file it is it will croak and die

352
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:31,128
so any amount we can line up fast space I
know we need the IP

353
01:13:33,834 --> 01:13:36,066
we're not going to read squash

354
01:13:37,305 --> 01:13:44,568
read why it right we want sink on all this
stuff but we need to change the stuff you
need to change it to our

355
01:13:44,868 --> 01:13:55,169
to our and other examples all these choices
are documented in in here you can go to go
to the man page for exports

356
01:13:56,169 --> 01:13:57,955
what side is what called

357
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:19,874
so we're going to go down here service start
the rpcbind a minute and if a server and his
order to start remind me to check the status
okay so we have got to go look at what goes
in the export file because

358
01:14:20,477 --> 01:14:35,948
and if SX4 to local network I want to look
up the network listing for the side I can
look it up but hey I asked blank screen

359
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:41,980
X-Ring in FS this is our generation oh no

360
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:49,192
this is Linux practical example sex wearing
a fisher's to Linux

361
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:59,098
experts share to single hose to all ho Sia.
There we go so we need to figure out what
are our ranges

362
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:07,180
I kind of I don't know if it's going to be a
sec

363
01:15:08,098 --> 01:15:25,647
I think this is our first reason to actually
list the the network range in our vagrant
creation so that we have a consistent IP it
doesn't just guess cuz I know we don't know
what IP ranges is going to be as far as I
know

364
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:28,625
and it's kind of a vagrant thing

365
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:45,844
I think I'm going to search for something
else on this I'm going to say what is the
default IP network range for vagrant I think
it's probably worth that explicitly putting
us in our bigger and file

366
01:15:56,171 --> 01:16:03,356
see how to change speaker to phone network
ragonese Levert we going to use

367
01:16:03,465 --> 01:16:06,644
networking vagrants go up here

368
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:15,318
configure forward port forward a meeting
with that we want the range is what we want

369
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:20,300
purple rain is a thing but when I'm going to
do that right now so right now we're going
to go look

370
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:24,858
and see the private Network there we go

371
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:28,387
here we have Network IP

372
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:51,009
so here is the IP address of the VM replace
it with your own if he shouldn't be able to
take effect if you want to say Pedro is it
automatically bhcp modify the private
Network definition by this I think this is a
default random IP address to be a sign of
the end in order to find out if either of
you need to SSH into the various Nations and
do I become in the public network

373
01:16:52,674 --> 01:17:05,657
an impeller is never going to be able to be
the same network as your host machine East
Fillmore receive its own IP address that's
because we're using bridge for that so

374
01:17:05,658 --> 01:17:09,714
we don't want you to be actually want to set
the private Network

375
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:17,410
they want to be able to set the range of
IEPs

376
01:17:18,629 --> 01:17:27,162
and I don't think I'm be done I think it
just I just picked a random network ID from
your internal localhost

377
01:17:27,331 --> 01:17:34,543
at me we can probably check right now just
by looking let's go look so if we go on to

378
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:43,900
vagrants SSH into SSH into control

379
01:17:44,297 --> 01:17:51,650
how's it going to risk a risk risk ex-wife
so IPA we're going to go check it out

380
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:10,851
so so here we have ETA is 0

381
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:21,494
this is on a 10. Network 10.0.2 I wonder if
it's always 10.0.2

382
01:18:22,727 --> 01:18:26,884
your name I don't know that it is we're
going to find out

383
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:37,986
because we can't we can't export it until we
know that IP range now I could go under the
control box

384
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:47,175
but I think in order to mounted from the
workers were going to have to be able to
point at it

385
01:18:52,505 --> 01:18:54,094
so

386
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:03,187
all right

387
01:19:12,312 --> 01:19:14,612
Echo rpcbind

388
01:19:16,341 --> 01:19:20,979
I don't know how to pick to stay at the
apartment work so that let's just figure
that out

389
01:19:22,964 --> 01:19:26,961
I don't either. We're probably in for
another one we don't need it for today

390
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:38,915
what LOL

391
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:46,584
we can do anything on. Local amighetti's of
Ahi for the naming

392
01:19:47,672 --> 01:19:53,174
yeah we will actually give it a name

393
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,333
oh my God

394
01:20:01,026 --> 01:20:08,114
localhost look in the main localhost look in
the main it didn't it didn't give it
anything

395
01:20:08,214 --> 01:20:12,703
oh yes it did control

396
01:20:18,364 --> 01:20:23,025
I mean this isn't this isn't no sense for
the network at all

397
01:20:32,688 --> 01:20:40,390
so what are we got we have is there any nice
or 0

398
01:20:43,854 --> 01:20:58,924
I don't know I try to figure out how we can
do this mapping on a vagrant normally in an
environment you know exactly what your IP
stuff is we have to scrape this based on how
big are build something so that makes it a
bit trickier and not too bad but

399
01:20:59,157 --> 01:21:05,957
I'm pretty sure that we can do

400
01:21:08,257 --> 01:21:10,789
just a generic

401
01:21:11,656 --> 01:21:17,210
this is the stuff I got to do is like a big
No-No that's why I'm driving super
interested you know

402
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:29,719
see here see on the client you need to do a
mountain need to be able to provide the IP
so if we don't give it an IP or we don't
mean to pull up a DNS server which is
another thing you know what

403
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:38,374
I mean it might be worth doing a DNS server
all by ourselves on one of these things it
might be worth having a vagrant that
Provisions a DNS server

404
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:54,137
this because if you if you can add that work
to this work and then we have a DNS server
we can actually assign the Eyed Peas to the
DNS server as well and make the whole thing
like virtualize but but I don't know if I
like it or no

405
01:21:54,139 --> 01:22:00,266
yeah this is this is mounting it without
permission is eccentrics or so

406
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:08,591
this is some restarting feser blah blah blah
yeah I don't have to know I don't think

407
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:13,821
yes yours is there's the path and there's a
hose and there's options

408
01:22:16,388 --> 01:22:24,282
I think the host can be a wildcard though
and then I would never haveand I would never
have used a while car before that's why I'm

409
01:22:24,594 --> 01:22:32,499
a sign of possible Spider-Man PowerPoint and
if it's not recommend you first read it or
even if that's the difference between blah

410
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,200
so this year as a single hose

411
01:22:36,812 --> 01:22:45,863
to a single client is in a festival to
exercise to get to refresh to share block no
options for back of bus I just bought

412
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:50,023
hey I'm in a can we get this morning

413
01:22:52,778 --> 01:22:56,122
I'll get the wondering if we do it with the
sink thing

414
01:22:56,882 --> 01:23:16,786
I swear it's sure to all hose there it is
it's a star alright that's what we want
that's what we want all right so that's like
the every fucking hoe something out where
this is really dangerous this is not
something you would do this is not something
you would normally do know it's like

415
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:23,957
but we're going to do it oh let me some Elsa
got open

416
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:32,482
who else has got an open to having also been
somewhere else bad me wait where are we for

417
01:23:32,758 --> 01:24:15,831
are we go tonight so yeah this is there
anywhere to get over there okay so let's
change this to Star and we wanted to read
right we wanted to be a synchronous this
means two people can write to the same file
at the same time which is super dangerous
but it's no more dangerous than Unix already
allows so you know we don't want to risk
washing anything I think we could just do we
want to try 10:00 and probably a sink I need
a sink is a default you have to look at all
these options and I just know that we'd ride
is the one I want and I wanted to be a sink
I don't want to be able to people to go
right to the thing at the same time I have a
conflict at this probably considerations
there if you have a trailing space this
won't work

418
01:24:15,837 --> 01:24:23,555
is this will not work export FS that's hard
to refresh it now

419
01:24:23,555 --> 01:24:27,930
if I think we have to turn on and if s let
me see

420
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:36,627
systemctl are PC Vines

421
01:24:39,562 --> 01:24:46,040
I whoops status

422
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:52,620
all right so obviously but he's not running
we need to have that run and then we have to
run n f s

423
01:24:52,678 --> 01:25:00,158
this is what I can't figure out where does
an FS come from I think I installed it wrong

424
01:25:02,057 --> 01:25:07,405
sudu now I see wrapped install

425
01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:14,544
Anna Faris is a local server colonel

426
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,586
sir or something that we got to see him of
course

427
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:26,254
I forgot how to install it I supposed to be
at fault

428
01:25:27,432 --> 01:25:32,943
somebody was telling me that yesterday
alright so

429
01:25:37,443 --> 01:25:42,999
okay so so so so so we need to we missing
some installs here

430
01:25:43,927 --> 01:25:49,700
we are still in effect utils rpcbind was
already on there

431
01:25:55,169 --> 01:26:00,663
install n f s all red head

432
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:08,535
somebody said it came by default and I don't
see it

433
01:26:08,847 --> 01:26:12,489
sonfs you tells you did that

434
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:20,689
includes I need to build your nfsr alright
well so why is it running

435
01:26:20,826 --> 01:26:28,002
or if it's serious to that but nobody nobody
shown

436
01:26:28,144 --> 01:26:32,398
and if that's your squash

437
01:26:38,022 --> 01:26:45,585
I don't need the Powerball rules inside if
it's a city.

438
01:26:45,585 --> 01:26:53,082
What are the mount why is Manifest already

439
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:55,395
I mean

440
01:26:57,572 --> 01:27:02,613
I guess you don't need her to see behind we
have everything but I thing but I don't
understand

441
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:09,291
hey I guess it's built in it maybe maybe
supposed to the colonel I don't know how to
sing to the service

442
01:27:10,162 --> 01:27:16,021
I'm seeing is turn off though so pseudo

443
01:27:16,453 --> 01:27:24,332
systemctl enable dash dash now rpcbind

444
01:27:27,168 --> 01:27:35,538
alright so let's go

445
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:51,318
oh my God

446
01:27:59,785 --> 01:28:01,022
go away

447
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,306
the Citadel says 50

448
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:24,047
systemctl NFL he's not a thing so when will
you know we need to do

449
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,341
we need to do a table by India

450
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:54,701
RPC mine are busy buying is a sub service of
it was made back in a time when we knew that
there was to be a limited number of ports
and four different services so are perceived
as a way to connect to Lennox in Unix and
decide and negotiate what port you're going
to communicate on from that point on

451
01:28:54,946 --> 01:29:55,313
rather than have a lockdown Port that you
had to use every time getting around this
port issue is been completely address by
kubernetes now so you don't see a lot of
stuff that uses our PC invented it does but
not this RBC not to like the Lennox RPC it
was it was designed for a different problem
where we had one server that was going to
deal with like multiple different
applications and services business people
write their applications and services to use
RPC and instead of saying oh I'm going to
run on this specific configure port in the
whole architecture in it has changed and
doesn't use this too much anymore that stuff
is all dealt with by containerization and
you know virtualized container networks that
we seen caretti's the main reasons he really
needs is a big thing is because a ton of
machines can have the same exact
configuration the same port listeners and
everything and it just works because of the
network routing

452
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:03,890
so in one sense it's a large work around $4
BC stuff so if we do this now we can say

453
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:12,627
we should be able to say well it should be
running so let's let's go look

454
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:21,193
on the status rpcbind I guess rbc's the only
service this thing right now

455
01:30:23,112 --> 01:30:27,834
yep and so we should be able

456
01:30:28,467 --> 01:30:34,459
how to connect in from another service
vagrants worker

457
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:39,280
oops SSH worker one

458
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:47,933
and not found or the filling out the dash up
there we go so

459
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:54,456
here we go now we can actually Mount from
here

460
01:30:54,458 --> 01:31:01,022
we should be able to mount it I should be
able to see do make directory / s

461
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:10,143
and Studio was just used to do as soon as
and we should be able to mount just using
remote

462
01:31:12,863 --> 01:31:26,583
what are the IP is up here and this is the
other thing we're going to figure out if
this is going to have to have a specific IP
this is this is what this can get tricky for
vagrant because we need to know the IP of
the thing we're going to mount right

463
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:34,641
and I that server has to have a specific

464
01:31:34,642 --> 01:31:42,449
I don't know how we're going to be able to
get around that honestly I don't I don't
think probably will be able to get around it
so here's here it is on the network though

465
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:46,185
worked out so that we could say Mount this

466
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:58,153
I think it's colon slash / S2 / ass

467
01:32:00,435 --> 01:32:04,796
it's going to try to talk to it I might have
that came out wrong

468
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:14,174
mount dashti

469
01:32:15,078 --> 01:32:22,742
Medina Fisher director of the climate she's
at Mount st.joe its type is in a Fest

470
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:31,586
Matt dasht-e this was an ef-s eventually

471
01:32:32,772 --> 01:32:37,122
and I can't talk to him I think it might be
the firewalls on

472
01:32:40,262 --> 01:32:46,693
wait did I start work now she can see it
okay

473
01:32:48,176 --> 01:32:53,447
ssage I want to see if we get a full
connection to it

474
01:32:56,594 --> 01:32:58,011
yes

475
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:12,379
unless I don't know if that's right it needs
to be using the I don't want to sell puppy
and Corruption right now or keep pears for
that I'm at a few but I can't accept
password

476
01:33:15,128 --> 01:33:21,235
so let me get let me get this so

477
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:24,432
write the number that we have our share

478
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:31,013
and the remote share and then you have the
local share right

479
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:49,305
I know what I think it is I think I have to
do I know what it is okay yeah I have I'm
pretty sure at the mount the same thing m n
t n f s just like a woman on the other
system right

480
01:33:52,798 --> 01:34:04,430
I don't know it could be that this not
answering they are PC things not answering I
don't know how to check to see if rfs's up
so that's that's a hard thing to do that I
don't understand

481
01:34:08,822 --> 01:34:11,376
it should I should work though

482
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:16,851
so let's do this I think there's a dad-to-be
wish there were

483
01:34:17,054 --> 01:34:24,956
weather is nice program not registered the
connection was refused

484
01:34:25,134 --> 01:34:30,103
so the NFL server is not answering

485
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:37,497
that's the problem program not registered

486
01:34:37,498 --> 01:34:52,285
oh oh okay so are PC is yes they are piece
eating is running but the NFL software is
not started and I don't know how to start
unifest services on here

487
01:34:56,089 --> 01:35:00,505
and said everything is in an FS is it NFS
client

488
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:08,041
loaded active and if it's Client Services
for the men FS

489
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:15,725
I'm active mounted Mountain FS loaded active
mounted

490
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:25,654
are those services are PC services

491
01:35:27,828 --> 01:35:33,174
Mountain FS unattractive

492
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:43,879
we need to figure this part out so
communication from everything else is there

493
01:35:44,498 --> 01:35:50,223
alright so let's see

494
01:35:51,007 --> 01:35:53,634
distance ATL

495
01:35:54,079 --> 01:36:00,895
they need a different it's not it's not
called the NFL's service anymore so I don't
know how to

496
01:36:01,095 --> 01:36:04,550
how to find that

497
01:36:17,394 --> 01:36:20,221
all right we've got

498
01:36:24,485 --> 01:36:25,984
I still have our PC stuff

499
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:36,608
is your progress it seems like they moved it
internally but it acted mounted

500
01:36:40,677 --> 01:36:46,472
interesting I don't know where they moved it

501
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:49,752
when you search for this

502
01:36:51,121 --> 01:36:56,134
where is an FS server in redhat 8

503
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:08,754
our vision for the speaker up nfsr Alyssa.
Rpcc

504
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:18,705
no it's not there so I'm trying to say it's
not there it hasn't been in since installed

505
01:37:20,564 --> 01:37:23,731
so it's an FS server Dash service

506
01:37:24,045 --> 01:37:31,790
it's not just an FS yeah here we go all
right so systemctl

507
01:37:32,255 --> 01:37:38,195
enable dash dash now NFS server

508
01:37:38,991 --> 01:37:46,206
nice all right and let's do our rep in fs
and boom Okay so

509
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:53,907
all right I need to put some information in
my notes Here Zedd create

510
01:37:54,916 --> 01:38:01,396
start an FS and our PC

511
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:15,026
on red hat Huron red hat I need to take
notes on this right so

512
01:38:20,064 --> 01:38:26,525
all right so cuz it's so IFS

513
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:34,381
runs as nrpc as server service

514
01:38:37,005 --> 01:38:45,893
therefore to check for it use the r PC

515
01:38:46,044 --> 01:38:48,132
info command

516
01:38:53,061 --> 01:38:54,587
I mean

517
01:38:59,004 --> 01:39:06,416
if it isn't there in means it hasn't been
installed

518
01:39:08,172 --> 01:39:11,582
or needs to be enabled

519
01:39:14,876 --> 01:39:18,265
70 pseudo

520
01:39:18,699 --> 01:39:24,748
yum that's why I install nfsu tills

521
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:38,950
okay so and then whatever you need to do

522
01:39:42,371 --> 01:39:48,116
then we need to do Studio system

523
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:54,300
any more stashed now rpcbind

524
01:39:54,911 --> 01:39:58,820
and an FS server

525
01:40:00,371 --> 01:40:06,056
all right that's some good notes have to be
able to pull those notes up later quickly

526
01:40:07,172 --> 01:40:10,453
I have a feeling that we're going to be
going

527
01:40:10,987 --> 01:40:20,726
yeah I'm that we might not even have to do
anything and if this is pretty robust and
wait at figuring stuff out so like

528
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:24,522
tell us the straight here so

529
01:40:25,799 --> 01:40:33,904
write the connection was finally free refuse
RPM program not registered let's just try it
again

530
01:40:35,156 --> 01:40:41,145
for my profile I think it's because we don't
have the client installed

531
01:40:42,325 --> 01:40:45,355
yeah I don't think we do

532
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:52,015
and what you're doing yeah we are still in a
fist utils so

533
01:40:52,181 --> 01:40:56,769
how can I get the client over here issue it
should be working what's the deal

534
01:40:56,847 --> 01:41:01,378
let's try it for a not registered Rock

535
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:13,841
princess versions versus incision 9th and
25th

536
01:41:16,217 --> 01:41:22,699
I have her a try we have to redo our export
I think of you

537
01:41:28,983 --> 01:41:36,941
o x nope

538
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:44,990
haha I'm so forgetful but it's definitely
running

539
01:41:48,953 --> 01:41:52,725
it's only running and it's listening to
everything

540
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,044
hundred so far we don't have 50 on here
anyway

541
01:41:59,566 --> 01:42:07,303
I have a disabled we didn't we didn't
disable of firewalls know we didn't

542
01:42:07,631 --> 01:42:15,165
we didn't get this is new I disable the fire
was on the other on the other instance I was
going I met that's in yeah

543
01:42:17,976 --> 01:42:23,319
so Farwell Damon

544
01:42:29,298 --> 01:42:36,469
turn off

545
01:42:36,861 --> 01:42:43,057
if only for a while on this to doesn't seem
like it's listening on the right port

546
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:52,419
this all figured out as the navel

547
01:42:54,408 --> 01:43:01,361
I receive our diversity to get S call him I
can figure it out if it's where you can find
for your spouse

548
01:43:01,755 --> 01:43:09,289
creams for your fish are we did that we did
this we in this a firm's issue

549
01:43:11,369 --> 01:43:21,121
yeah I could be they could be from Joshua's
that soup or 2727 if I will yeah absolutely
can do that I don't want to right now

550
01:43:24,178 --> 01:43:26,294
did I do now

551
01:43:31,007 --> 01:43:43,397
you didn't like that I just right now I
don't I don't want to fuck with ports
there's definitely instructions on how to do
the poor thing so we should do the poor
thing properly to learn it in the long term

552
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:49,660
but I think I want to make sure the
permissions are fine

553
01:43:49,661 --> 01:43:55,337
an ml mount FS

554
01:43:56,731 --> 01:44:01,505
yeah we need to make this is also really
dangerous

555
01:44:02,697 --> 01:44:06,345
but we need to turn me to open the
permissions up on that

556
01:44:09,698 --> 01:44:15,614
equation for a furnace in this guy will send
you all the information to direct you to the
NFL share folder

557
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:22,458
yep

558
01:44:25,913 --> 01:44:34,322
I don't know if I should send a picture cuz
I don't think I figured out of shown I think
this might be stopping you from getting
mounted to the truth

559
01:44:36,814 --> 01:44:43,647
I didn't do any for sure but I think we
should do this

560
01:44:46,394 --> 01:44:49,398
Mount n f s

561
01:44:52,820 --> 01:45:00,280
and restore nfsu tools

562
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:06,624
yeah I would not have thought you that maybe
that's what I need to do system

563
01:45:06,624 --> 01:45:09,128
sm-6 yell

564
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:17,101
utils there's utils answer and mountie
holyshit

565
01:45:25,634 --> 01:45:28,480
Port map not working

566
01:45:34,093 --> 01:45:40,442
it is Sir I'm going to need to restart RP
see buy into

567
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:55,482
AA promises it can't connect to it so it's
it's not seeing the running service

568
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:06,365
Griffin ephessus there it's listening Nets
stats

569
01:46:13,015 --> 01:46:19,462
there is definitely listening but it's not

570
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:28,506
connecting could be the outbound firewall I
don't know I mean

571
01:46:30,199 --> 01:46:35,840
give me the IP is wrong let's try that

572
01:46:37,763 --> 01:46:42,666
it's soon to not 15 on 24 so that's huge
should be fine

573
01:46:44,753 --> 01:46:52,363
any Wheat we know because we pinged a thing
Paint n. 0. 2. 15

574
01:46:53,917 --> 01:47:01,280
penis is up everything's up SOC on the fire
report to me and I can't hear

575
01:47:04,165 --> 01:47:05,797
how's it going

576
01:47:11,233 --> 01:47:18,175
how far is it how are you I see services

577
01:47:18,231 --> 01:47:23,606
NFS is 2049 Okay so

578
01:47:23,816 --> 01:47:26,839
and see

579
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:36,148
nc-20 49 oh

580
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:42,438
have a good that's not good

581
01:47:44,718 --> 01:47:49,331
I am app I am map

582
01:48:11,056 --> 01:48:13,030
install

583
01:48:14,626 --> 01:48:21,306
I have a feeling it's not something's
blocking it you have the wrong IP or

584
01:48:24,543 --> 01:48:27,925
and this is funny cuz he's are all Hacker
techniques

585
01:48:29,269 --> 01:48:34,243
yeah it's it's listening rpcbind it's just
not listening

586
01:48:34,243 --> 01:48:41,534
for some reason the NFL stuff not loosening
the server. Now I know it's supposed to go
to that

587
01:48:43,467 --> 01:48:45,559
that's PA

588
01:48:51,085 --> 01:48:53,107
now we could do

589
01:48:54,621 --> 01:49:07,971
I mean the 2049 to delegate it to that so
that's everything always confuses the issue
when you're when you're dealing with for
scanning and it's closed it says

590
01:49:08,826 --> 01:49:11,492
Alex

591
01:49:14,553 --> 01:49:21,803
so I'm not sure if that's because every
piece of you normally our PC is fine Fort
map

592
01:49:27,753 --> 01:49:42,757
irbc is supposed to delegate the incoming
forced to do so and if x is supposed to go
to our PC and say hey what part do I need
and then it delegated to the porch and
that's why we're not showing that particular
part is listening even though it is
listening so

593
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:52,055
so I'm missing something simple here I don't
know what it is it's almost like an FS
server is not running in the way it needs to
be

594
01:49:55,540 --> 01:50:02,839
I miss you something simple something simple
anime sink

595
01:50:02,839 --> 01:50:06,788
export I didn't do a RV

596
01:50:07,544 --> 01:50:11,388
I did not use a army list for that

597
01:50:13,323 --> 01:50:20,866
I just want a fast exporting

598
01:50:28,111 --> 01:50:29,505
manifest

599
01:50:36,214 --> 01:50:37,846
the shoe Mill do it

600
01:50:44,951 --> 01:50:49,066
so close we're getting their connection
refused

601
01:50:55,224 --> 01:50:57,757
how can I getting connection refused

602
01:51:01,694 --> 01:51:05,271
format Carrie query we train our Police
Department registered

603
01:51:08,432 --> 01:51:13,565
it seems like the RPC it seem like our PC
does not know about the NFL service

604
01:51:13,913 --> 01:51:19,039
that's that's what it seems like to me and I
did I miss something I obviously missed
something

605
01:51:21,042 --> 01:51:26,655
to me it seems like our PC does not know how
do you look at all the RPC stuff I forgot

606
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:34,819
I meet with rpcbind has an offense in here

607
01:51:39,645 --> 01:51:46,287
oh whoops can when it when is it do info

608
01:51:48,253 --> 01:51:51,226
it says there's the Manifest running already
right

609
01:51:58,612 --> 01:52:01,594
so I don't know what's really going on here

610
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:09,053
that's if it was also there should be a
short a short stance for exporting all
directories V

611
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,781
I asked for the fuss

612
01:52:15,751 --> 01:52:23,504
Sr Mount so they sing til I hide try to
start Port map for UPS on

613
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:30,288
should I be on already I know he's really
surprised

614
01:52:31,758 --> 01:52:39,609
I thought perhaps your PC service all right
I think they renamed it I think it's hard to
see my now I don't know I don't know

615
01:52:44,043 --> 01:52:55,401
okay the final step in for your service a
lot of his servers through the fire on
sentiments ate the services are and if it's
something by Tenth Mountain D I have not
been restarting mountie though

616
01:52:57,194 --> 01:53:03,424
this is a really great document do I got to
add this to my roommate

617
01:53:06,667 --> 01:53:10,372
yeah

618
01:53:13,512 --> 01:53:20,426
I'll reload I don't know firewall that might
my impression is that fart

619
01:53:23,517 --> 01:53:27,334
my precious the firewall is still getting in
the way but

620
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:34,534
it doesn't seem to be the case there is no
firewall Damon running at all I killed it

621
01:53:35,372 --> 01:53:37,744
inactive dead

622
01:53:42,728 --> 01:53:45,778
tell her if I was here at 6.

623
01:53:54,261 --> 01:53:58,738
I mean I fell asleep and get you some other
poor other

624
01:53:58,959 --> 01:54:03,317
give me a dang it might not hurt but I don't
think that's it I really don't

625
01:54:03,535 --> 01:54:09,916
if his client is something wrong with your
clan ankle tools one of that's it

626
01:54:10,198 --> 01:54:13,877
I've never put those on before

627
01:54:18,028 --> 01:54:23,889
and if is common Havasu till zarfoss medical
tools

628
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:27,683
just put them outside of fishers in the show
Malcolm and

629
01:54:28,074 --> 01:54:32,790
on the server oh hey there's a good ping
let's do that

630
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:39,131
show Mount I didn't know you could do
external are you do that

631
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:42,383
exported on 10.

632
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:52,724
Show mounts Dashie but then you go aren't
you program at register

633
01:54:52,729 --> 01:54:55,907
yeah that means

634
01:54:58,314 --> 01:55:03,136
let's go to that are specificallylet's go to
that are specifically

635
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:06,745
animal

636
01:55:12,538 --> 01:55:18,576
krain corner clamp I can't wait to get your
extra client over there.

637
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:25,081
Very good I'm taking Kyle fucking rvcc

638
01:55:26,879 --> 01:55:28,549
Weber rotisserie

639
01:55:38,292 --> 01:55:42,405
nothing there come on baby

640
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:56,234
I don't think something is not connected
between RPC and n f s

641
01:56:07,019 --> 01:56:12,851
are busy buying service got started yes if
any of that

642
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:18,555
does every Sea by need to be on the client
as well and doesn't write

643
01:56:19,368 --> 01:56:23,885
I think it might be I mean it couldn't be
there

644
01:56:26,902 --> 01:56:29,551
are is active it's running it's listening

645
01:56:30,112 --> 01:56:42,482
it does need to be rebooted mrpc info has a
Nifty has an offense in here so far so good
right

646
01:56:49,045 --> 01:56:53,023
search orpc info yeah

647
01:56:55,162 --> 01:56:57,214
it's definitely listening

648
01:57:10,471 --> 01:57:14,777
are busy but I'm glad I'm looking at the
stuff I remember having to debug this before

649
01:57:16,807 --> 01:57:20,959
are Sylvania got it

650
01:57:23,214 --> 01:57:29,405
limcee dead men it's the same thing

651
01:57:39,227 --> 01:57:46,817
or Superuser I mean it could be this is
Superuser this doing it you know

652
01:57:47,110 --> 01:57:52,161
it could be the ACL things it could be
something to these heels and she can you
denied

653
01:57:55,221 --> 01:57:59,942
it could be I mean it could be a mission
such as this being shown in something
different right

654
01:58:10,052 --> 01:58:13,562
mount mount is running to

655
01:58:14,111 --> 01:58:18,621
I do not need to be restarted every time I
don't think it does

656
01:58:20,412 --> 01:58:24,148
FS melty and lock a manager

657
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:32,459
s e n f s a c l is running to it that makes
me think that there's an an ACL thing that's
not installed

658
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,271
you know what I mean

659
01:58:34,668 --> 01:58:40,883
I'm going to try this I'm going to try to
install this cuz I don't think that's on the
client

660
01:58:42,483 --> 01:58:46,818
in my case so

661
01:58:48,847 --> 01:58:50,882
install

662
01:58:52,758 --> 01:59:00,240
yeah there's no ACL tools I have a feeling
it's not authorizing I mean it could be that

663
01:59:00,479 --> 01:59:06,114
but I'm not register this so weird I guess
not

664
01:59:08,656 --> 01:59:16,654
help for I'm not registering a just keep
saying the RPC failures are or unusual

665
01:59:17,675 --> 01:59:23,755
they're unusually cuz that means it is
talking to our PC and then

666
01:59:23,755 --> 01:59:31,566
it's making it on PC connection in our PC
say hey there's no one at Fest over here and
I mean

667
01:59:33,214 --> 01:59:38,115
I almost think I should take it down the
services in order

668
01:59:38,709 --> 01:59:42,980
because I started rpcbind before I
startedstarted an FS server

669
01:59:43,275 --> 01:59:48,124
I bet you if I start an FS server first and
then start PC by and it might be better off

670
01:59:48,741 --> 01:59:54,912
what do you think let's try that it can't
hurt so system cgl

671
01:59:59,347 --> 02:00:06,777
since I'm absolutely yeah and I can paint it
and talk to it and everything yeah that's
something I thought that wouldn't make me an
issue

672
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:14,209
and whips if it's there

673
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:19,427
I mean I can assist you and everything so

674
02:00:19,649 --> 02:00:26,697
the RPC Services connecting this message

675
02:00:27,103 --> 02:00:30,911
that message is being generated from

676
02:00:32,067 --> 02:00:51,653
the server I want to say this is actually
the RPC is making or PC connection in the
RPC server is telling from the client I
don't have a service called NFS which means
it somehow it doesn't see it even though our
prpc info says it's right there

677
02:00:51,903 --> 02:00:59,568
so do you mean because it's it says it's
there so

678
02:01:00,092 --> 02:01:08,400
Imma Try Something system cclr PC info
rpcbind stop

679
02:01:11,257 --> 02:01:13,908
stop halt whatever

680
02:01:19,495 --> 02:01:21,278
alright so

681
02:01:23,103 --> 02:01:28,013
and I'm going to stop and Fs you so sorry
star actually

682
02:01:28,356 --> 02:01:32,386
let's restart now the NFL server

683
02:01:33,808 --> 02:01:41,433
I think that might be it actually and then
let's restart rpcbind

684
02:01:42,657 --> 02:01:45,194
and I don't think we have to

685
02:01:48,283 --> 02:01:51,329
I I don't think we have to restart buying
the

686
02:01:56,787 --> 02:01:58,659
Absolute Towing it

687
02:02:01,811 --> 02:02:07,219
it's just it's not going to I don't stop
it's like really freaking confusing

688
02:02:09,129 --> 02:02:16,655
I'm out going wrong I live on Canal Road

689
02:02:26,625 --> 02:02:35,381
all right so so so so it's like I'm hacking
into an FS but now I'm like motivated

690
02:02:38,544 --> 02:02:44,042
I don't think why do we need nfsu2 Hills

691
02:02:44,059 --> 02:02:51,213
we already have an official seals on the
clients so that's not a thing but I don't
even see why he would need that I don't

692
02:02:56,718 --> 02:02:58,868
if it's already

693
02:02:59,502 --> 02:03:06,156
tell me the acsi keeps him vacation where to
read with that error message means

694
02:03:12,367 --> 02:03:18,386
this is a very hard thing to find cuz people
don't have our PC Services is really old

695
02:03:19,852 --> 02:03:25,003
it's really really hard to search for the
ship because it's ancient knowledge

696
02:03:25,601 --> 02:03:29,794
her up she sure acted like his Services
cream crust

697
02:03:32,417 --> 02:03:37,816
positive ways RC versus Wade as is nice

698
02:03:40,563 --> 02:03:43,144
that's pretty good to add

699
02:03:53,678 --> 02:04:00,347
all right so I don't know I don't know if I
figure I got to start this all over again

700
02:04:00,347 --> 02:04:03,356
so from like Step 1

701
02:04:06,962 --> 02:04:12,180
I want to say that I I think that order in
which we booted

702
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:21,194
the we started up to Services is still
affecting it but I have no indication of
that otherwise I shall Mount is failing III
like

703
02:04:22,471 --> 02:04:28,085
here's exactly what we tried to do and it's
not able to connect

704
02:04:29,549 --> 02:04:34,739
and yeah we can't so you can see it

705
02:04:36,381 --> 02:04:43,960
wait we haven't we haven't we haven't
directory right as long as that's not their
decisions that somebody is

706
02:04:44,436 --> 02:04:46,626
Ella stay right there

707
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:56,040
McGinnis I don't think it's a permissions
issue of such as running is route and

708
02:04:59,797 --> 02:05:05,699
I mean unless that's the wrong machine that
mean that's the only other possibility

709
02:05:06,595 --> 02:05:14,367
let's try something so for guitar vagrant
SSH

710
02:05:14,798 --> 02:05:20,264
IPA so

711
02:05:23,859 --> 02:05:28,076
all right so we have we we wait

712
02:05:31,229 --> 02:05:35,257
wait what how many zombie praying

713
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:45,495
and to make any sense I might have the wrong
IP number

714
02:05:47,245 --> 02:05:50,536
it doesn't make any sense cuz we had map
that has a seizure

715
02:05:54,554 --> 02:05:57,367
I've been seeing for SP-10 for the recorder

716
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:08,109
I don't know about AR-15 for it I didn't
know it was remote command I haven't used it
before

717
02:06:13,965 --> 02:06:21,577
I know it looks like they're all the same IP
is like how the fuck is it doing that it's
impossible for them to have the same IP

718
02:06:23,941 --> 02:06:25,928
that's impossible

719
02:06:31,351 --> 02:06:36,514
now that you're right so

720
02:06:41,074 --> 02:06:48,008
I'm have two deployments Bridge Network make
any sense though

721
02:06:48,829 --> 02:06:53,965
because they're supposed to all be on their
same network does that mean vagrants not
putting them on the same network

722
02:06:54,914 --> 02:07:04,381
it's fucking insane what's a quick command
to get the exact IP of the system on a th20
I just grabbed find out I guess

723
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:06,767
I see that

724
02:07:10,757 --> 02:07:16,237
I batdr is that the one yeah I can't
remember

725
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:22,749
at last what I am doing right now eight is
too afraid to hear I'm pretty sure

726
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:35,775
cell they all have the same IP holyshit

727
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:47,061
that is blowing my mind how the fuck do they
have the same IP does that mean every single
one of them is knotted

728
02:07:48,433 --> 02:07:53,020
oh my God they all are every one of them is
added

729
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:57,570
new Z8 do these easy recipe

730
02:07:57,867 --> 02:08:04,772
these used to people they should be getting
that they're supposed to use the ACP from
vagrant

731
02:08:06,567 --> 02:08:10,500
well that explains it I mean we least found
the problem

732
02:08:10,501 --> 02:08:15,463
and that's definitely the problem is there's
no doubt there's a problem

733
02:08:16,804 --> 02:08:23,352
I mean that's that's crazy yeah

734
02:08:23,835 --> 02:08:29,683
what time do I check what their JCPenney
dresses over there so she if they have
Lisa's or whatever

735
02:08:30,854 --> 02:08:36,714
what is it that the thing it doesn't the
thing that totally confuses me is

736
02:08:38,342 --> 02:08:41,654
that means every one of them

737
02:08:44,572 --> 02:08:51,605
there's no way you could get the same IP
there's no easy way

738
02:08:56,189 --> 02:09:02,239
this is this is important I really have to
understand that working with Vigor and
because this is a we're going to be using
they going to test

739
02:09:00,889 --> 02:09:04,796
using a drone to test networking so

740
02:09:06,387 --> 02:09:13,147
yeah and there is no networking
configuration it's just a default right

741
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:20,341
so so yeah I thought I was going to be able
to just ignore this

742
02:09:20,903 --> 02:09:28,676
but clearly we can't we're going to have to
set our own private Network and then have
everything beyond that work and

743
02:09:28,677 --> 02:09:35,863
inside of yam well we were just in one you
talked about making a new one

744
02:09:44,035 --> 02:09:50,733
Aries prime number guess what I'm saying it
did 10. Network is this is the private
Network right

745
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:59,537
that's what I understand because okay I'm
snow

746
02:10:03,249 --> 02:10:05,724
there is no other network

747
02:10:11,203 --> 02:10:13,637
this is very confusing to me

748
02:10:15,088 --> 02:10:21,633
I didn't think two two two systems could
exist the same IP address without causing a
serious problem

749
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:36,246
that works for me Cinemark in Yosemite

750
02:10:37,553 --> 02:10:38,989
yeah

751
02:10:41,489 --> 02:10:46,284
no these are all these are all internal and
these are all on these are on the plate of
Naperville

752
02:10:46,702 --> 02:10:52,373
yeah they're they're all deployed with
vagrant so they all get

753
02:10:53,062 --> 02:11:06,466
whatever you know what let's go look that's
actually open virtualbox in and look at it
graphically so here they are these get a
vision automatically approve a green right

754
02:11:10,327 --> 02:11:16,011
do they have the same give me address I
don't know that's what we're trying to
figure out so

755
02:11:16,011 --> 02:11:19,909
here we go out network adapter Nat

756
02:11:21,733 --> 02:11:25,105
so this is this is what I think has happened

757
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:33,724
I think each one of these has has an
attitude connection is all getting shared

758
02:11:33,724 --> 02:11:46,396
and we probably offer so I know I'm pretty
sure we can fix this by just sitting at
Bridge Network and be done with it but when
we do the movie provision it but I'm just
really curious

759
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:52,182
how it got this far along

760
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:57,811
attach to net Bridge Eternal Network so

761
02:11:59,428 --> 02:12:06,586
now suffice it to say we're going to have to
do some more networking network setup

762
02:12:06,698 --> 02:12:11,380
check with a network config which network in
fig

763
02:12:14,647 --> 02:12:22,189
so the back look alike.

764
02:12:22,189 --> 02:12:29,245
169 why would they have run 69 I'm in the
van right now

765
02:12:29,384 --> 02:12:32,918
Etsy

766
02:12:33,704 --> 02:12:38,853
there's there's Network at figures it I mean
it's Rich redhead so

767
02:12:42,984 --> 02:12:45,659
back to DP

768
02:12:46,356 --> 02:12:53,664
is felis currently only has a connection
with jrpc literacy

769
02:12:56,670 --> 02:13:03,796
yeah I don't see anything that I recognize
here cell

770
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:15,816
I I I think I know how to fix this I think
the way to fix this is to explicitly defined
the

771
02:13:15,817 --> 02:13:21,064
private Network for the vagrants

772
02:13:21,064 --> 02:13:27,991
house when they're provisioned and I think
that that will do the magic to set up the
networking

773
02:13:27,992 --> 02:13:38,326
which is not doing clearly now I thought for
sure it was know what was confusing to me
the most of all is that I can get to any of
these things

774
02:13:38,326 --> 02:13:43,437
it knows about them it knows how to get to
them that's thethat's the that's the
confusing part

775
02:13:47,506 --> 02:13:53,139
you know what when it was bringing it up at
told us what 16-16-8 network it was on

776
02:13:56,319 --> 02:14:03,949
are give me a second there when we when we
did the vagrant up thing

777
02:14:04,527 --> 02:14:07,930
the same same take down one of the one of
the

778
02:14:09,929 --> 02:14:13,686
I think I'm one of the workers just take
that work or two so worker

779
02:14:18,357 --> 02:14:24,578
reload record till now watch the output

780
02:14:24,763 --> 02:14:32,602
so right that she freeze machine we can
definitely do that but it's getting is going
to give a 16-8 address

781
02:14:33,933 --> 02:14:41,051
so I think I think we can use a different
address

782
02:14:43,171 --> 02:14:46,796
because he sees her now to 192 yeah

783
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:54,263
static IP DHCP house ain't ya DHCP does
allocate them but they're not known to the
client

784
02:14:54,601 --> 02:15:06,641
they're not they're not known to itself
that's what's confusing right and that's
that's what I'm that's why I'm confused by
two cycles through

785
02:15:06,775 --> 02:15:13,880
what just going to give us a p it's going to
say there is a generous know it gives us
another one

786
02:15:15,268 --> 02:15:23,235
I remember this printing out the number of
the IP address for SSH connect connections

787
02:15:27,639 --> 02:15:32,335
running shell and I guess not

788
02:15:33,369 --> 02:15:37,321
maybe after the Reformation I mean be with
you more the reprovision it

789
02:15:38,453 --> 02:15:47,397
oh no I just created a new IP and just put a
new SSH arrest for the same worker for well
I see what it's doing

790
02:15:48,109 --> 02:15:50,154
as for say

791
02:15:53,649 --> 02:15:57,961
yeah it makes me want to end up my whole
119:160 network

792
02:16:01,864 --> 02:16:12,784
but these are not in so they shouldn't be
getting direct eyepiece from that they
should be getting they should be getting eye
peas from this computer and using this
computer as if it had the hcp to give out

793
02:16:12,785 --> 02:16:20,358
Manassas that's how I've seen that that's
What mattered what are the routes say should
we look at the routes again

794
02:16:26,089 --> 02:16:33,843
annotation gateway's when I said to

795
02:16:33,843 --> 02:16:41,614
they all have the same fight for you though
the side of my TV is not working can pig
yeah

796
02:16:42,235 --> 02:16:44,273
right

797
02:16:46,776 --> 02:16:53,158
I think two things would fix this I think if
either explicitly putting in the vagrant
file

798
02:16:53,159 --> 02:16:59,178
but I'm kind of curious yeah

799
02:16:59,178 --> 02:17:06,212
they they do they don't have the same
gateway then we'll know it's a different
that right oh I see where you going

800
02:17:06,214 --> 02:17:11,610
okay I don't know if it's

801
02:17:13,593 --> 02:17:21,030
it's so weird have the same Gateway that the
same IP address

802
02:17:22,887 --> 02:17:28,502
and they have the same Mac address

803
02:17:35,898 --> 02:17:42,756
they can't talk to each other that's the
problem now they can't see each other at all

804
02:17:42,756 --> 02:17:57,848
they can't see each other at all that's the
problem that's why are PCS not working so I
did the crazy thing is I have my pins in
this is Asia's everything we're working
because I was just contacting myself because
the routes The Raspberries we're going to
the same one

805
02:18:00,187 --> 02:18:15,700
yeah I tried to make an investment on 10.2
9:15 and I mentioned it was probably DNS
round-robin anything to one that doesn't
have it so I was either hitting worker it is
a thing we are but I don't know

806
02:18:15,730 --> 02:18:22,488
Adam Statesville I know I could try that one
though I mean this is super interesting

807
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:30,575
this is actually really good to practice my
networking stuff to a bit more I've been a
while since I've done that work I do
debugging

808
02:18:31,093 --> 02:18:38,178
so that's actually cool and I'm stopped what
is that when I don't use it NM State CDL

809
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:56,323
I kind of don't want to throw this away it
just yet because I really want to figure
this out

810
02:19:00,057 --> 02:19:01,899
is it NM state

811
02:19:08,112 --> 02:19:14,326
estate auction is that doing when I start it

812
02:19:20,796 --> 02:19:22,786
say mac addresses yeah

813
02:19:23,895 --> 02:19:32,965
I don't know that's what blows my mind that
I've never seen it before I've never seen
that before this is the first time

814
02:19:33,561 --> 02:19:41,439
I've seen two vm's running on the same
system with the same Mac address

815
02:19:57,515 --> 02:20:01,338
DNS resolver oh that's the name okay

816
02:20:07,944 --> 02:20:10,330
is that easy JCPenney now

817
02:20:11,808 --> 02:20:21,146
that's why I'm saying if there's a vagrant
sitting in the network that will tell it to
use the hcp and it's not doing it by default
my default it's not doing shit

818
02:20:24,238 --> 02:20:31,993
oh yeah I said I said I'll try to figure out
how it's not configured from that I know

819
02:20:37,072 --> 02:20:44,216
oh you think the image is fucked up you
think the image itself my baby fuck up

820
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:50,374
yeah interesting that would be a bugger in
Elma 8

821
02:20:51,221 --> 02:20:58,099
are there we can check that really quick by
using like one of the extent of us like a
stream the stream thing

822
02:20:59,020 --> 02:21:08,375
yeah

823
02:21:09,312 --> 02:21:18,531
I need to reconfigure networking yeah well I
don't want to reconfigure networking right
now myself I mean. This is a cool exercise
but this is not necessary for what I want to
do

824
02:21:18,674 --> 02:21:20,719
all right yeah

825
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:48,256
that's what I'm trying to figure out Bill
how the fuck do they get an IV with no DHCP
in a virtual machine I have no idea this is
the thing that baffles me this reason I
don't want to throw this away and try by
adding look there's case anybody just wants
to Jump Ahead there is a no. VM. Network
configuration that's missing from here than
almost everybody puts in everything and I
figured I would use the default

826
02:21:51,522 --> 02:21:57,693
like the bigger box has static IP networking
yam right and

827
02:21:58,331 --> 02:22:05,481
yeah I don't think central is comes with
static IP set up by default I don't think
that's a thing right

828
02:22:05,607 --> 02:22:12,550
I don't think that's a thing I think it's I
think the image itself is messed up yeah
there's

829
02:22:14,463 --> 02:22:16,297
if

830
02:22:18,972 --> 02:22:33,162
I don't know maybe maybe it is done by
vagrant make maybe vagrant is doing it since
I didn't put anything in the networking
thing it did do any magic and so it as soon
as I want to set up a piece and it wants me
to explicitly to find the IP in the in the
vagrant file for each one

831
02:22:33,163 --> 02:22:44,171
I mean that's a possibility it could be that
that it's letting me do that you know it's
like hey you didn't tell us what to do
automatically so we expect you to set up
your own IP networking

832
02:22:45,003 --> 02:22:47,878
I thought vagrant works

833
02:22:52,245 --> 02:22:57,824
the thing I don't understand is how this is
even on the network at all

834
02:22:58,039 --> 02:23:02,459
and the only reason I'm able to SSH into the
thing is because the SSH is all

835
02:23:00,946 --> 02:23:11,854
cuz the SSH is on 127 and there's some
protocol routing and they've mapped a
specific ports I sought make her do that in
that specific ports to specific machines

836
02:23:12,385 --> 02:23:19,985
and that's what is bypassing a network IP
routing completely otherwise how the fuck
are you connected to it I'm afraid yeah

837
02:23:21,189 --> 02:23:23,451
that's what really confuses me

838
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:29,722
so so this is serious discovery

839
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:35,174
I'm in a truck all this and try a different
image to see if it has a similar issue

840
02:23:35,646 --> 02:23:38,185
and I'm using generic El Metate

841
02:23:40,871 --> 02:23:46,834
what MC Lyte device modify ETA should be the
method also there why

842
02:23:50,594 --> 02:24:04,031
why would I do that just to check if you
still on on the thing to try to get a
networking to work by itself that we're
doing at work he bugging I find an exciting
but it's actually not relevant to what I
want to do

843
02:24:04,614 --> 02:24:21,836
yeah this is I need to do this has been a
really good reminder that I need to really
deep dive into colonel in our network
configuration and stuff like that mcla
device modify

844
02:24:22,771 --> 02:24:27,401
ETA is 0 ipv4

845
02:24:34,069 --> 02:24:36,145
yep

846
02:24:38,282 --> 02:24:45,441
at least we're going to let you use it real
Ruby not Rouge next hop address

847
02:24:48,126 --> 02:24:51,345
24 I didn't think of it as someone i p at
now

848
02:24:53,541 --> 02:25:06,773
do we do we change it to used to be but then
we have to restart not working right can't
you just restart system CDL or sissy to
restart to get the how do you restart
networking these days and used to be you do
and it networking restart

849
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:09,607
and I don't know how to restart networking

850
02:25:09,626 --> 02:25:17,914
I don't want to admit one and then it's 6 or
5 or whatever it is not 3 I think

851
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,375
do you remember

852
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:33,808
yeah

853
02:25:35,548 --> 02:25:44,850
ice regulars use real Ruby not reset the
server evening networking only

854
02:25:45,715 --> 02:25:47,386
yeah

855
02:25:48,057 --> 02:25:53,827
I got a raise every reset it's used HTP and
we need to be able to restart the machine to
use the pull-down the networking

856
02:25:55,872 --> 02:26:02,663
yeah this is some pretty interesting at work
an admin stuff

857
02:26:03,715 --> 02:26:08,003
yeah they're there is I just don't know
which one it is

858
02:26:12,552 --> 02:26:15,074
it is changed

859
02:26:15,196 --> 02:26:21,776
Linux restart networking restart the entire
networking service

860
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:29,142
and is it the network manager

861
02:26:29,734 --> 02:26:36,823
since I was a dick in his Network oh my God
that's cool that's what I used to use hasn't
changed yay

862
02:26:36,824 --> 02:26:42,699
assistant seashell status Network

863
02:26:43,315 --> 02:26:50,693
he felt I would be a no then you can check
the network status

864
02:26:52,903 --> 02:26:55,737
nope that would be a no

865
02:26:57,590 --> 02:27:04,672
I am pretty sure it's sissy t l redhat uses
nmcli

866
02:27:04,783 --> 02:27:08,431
isn't it says beside for the name

867
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:19,466
and then are there we go

868
02:27:19,738 --> 02:27:27,879
and I'm still I'm really hoping to join
network manager while I didn't go as a
redhead thing right

869
02:27:28,548 --> 02:27:32,387
I am so I networking

870
02:27:33,617 --> 02:27:37,253
train station

871
02:27:42,248 --> 02:27:43,662
animeand a mother

872
02:27:54,024 --> 02:28:01,064
to to do to do afar on

873
02:28:02,151 --> 02:28:09,169
man that's totally cool you know I might
have to get rid of certified

874
02:28:11,443 --> 02:28:18,029
I might have to if I'm going to keep doing
this red has got so many quirks to it that
it make it unique

875
02:28:20,936 --> 02:28:22,221
yeah

876
02:28:30,427 --> 02:28:32,638
enter the connection type

877
02:28:36,261 --> 02:28:39,273
it's me. I've been tables holyshit

878
02:28:39,892 --> 02:28:47,823
I just got this stuff is cuz I had the last
time that I dug down into Network managers
and stuff like that was 20 years ago

879
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:56,020
it's changed so much goddamn it's so
different seriously I have so much to catch
up on

880
02:28:56,693 --> 02:29:50,800
and then you know all that all I'm
programming that I do it just takes away
from you know everything is just moving so
fast there's just so many layers in keeping
track of every fucking thing all the way
through application development and
container orchestration in Cloud
architecture and then all of the low-level
in a service changes to the system
administration that's just so fucking much
to learn as crazy as a pain in the ass yeah
I was just going to say network manager is I
don't even know networkmanager it used to be
that you added a couple of miles a year has
started your network service in the net your
and it's ripped and you're good to go but
it's totally different now and it's just
insisted he's complicated the shit out of
everything 2 so I feel like a kindergartner
looking at the stuff I do this shit like
inside and out as you know

881
02:29:51,216 --> 02:29:59,037
am I not right. I'm totally Red Hat now yeah
for Enterprise for Enterprise I'm already at
yeah

882
02:30:00,924 --> 02:30:16,023
I pee I know is a little air it already is
right that's what's so crazy is it I mean
it's just yeah but I mean if you're going to
act this shit then I got to know about it so
either other than ministering entering
breaking into it I want I need to know it
all

883
02:30:17,893 --> 02:30:24,237
is there an attic and what did she High
feeling up and down

884
02:30:29,171 --> 02:30:33,917
and I'm still right-handed Khan you should
cereal

885
02:30:34,587 --> 02:30:39,768
yeah I I got a I got a back I have to back
away from

886
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:52,694
yeah I think I have to step away from this

887
02:30:53,523 --> 02:31:27,468
because I just can't I can't I got to get
back to the NFL stuff I want to dive into
the networking right now but I right now the
networking is really fucked and this is a
vagrant thing so I mean we can spend all
night trying to go through Network debugging
and configuration to understand it and I'm
super interested to do that but I need to
pull myself out of this to this is what I
understand it's got to do is to post name
it's pulling down to the stuff that was
added

888
02:31:27,632 --> 02:31:35,583
let me check the other worker that stuff
that was added right when we did her when we
did the nmcli command

889
02:31:36,068 --> 02:31:41,556
there's no Colonel now right at the same One
external assistance from distro

890
02:31:41,779 --> 02:31:44,552
I need to restart it yeah

891
02:31:45,495 --> 02:31:51,878
yeah but I want to know where he's going to
pull it and she pull up from the parent do
you see piece of rubber thing

892
02:31:52,878 --> 02:32:04,006
I think because the thing is this is what
I'm afraid of with an adding right is like
who's going to serve up the DHCP just going
to broadcast to the networkers and not going
to go outside of the internal Network

893
02:32:05,742 --> 02:32:12,832
yeah that's right I mean I'll try a couple
of those things with you but I want to leave
this

894
02:32:18,113 --> 02:32:24,589
alright so was it what was it nmcli or IPA

895
02:32:26,516 --> 02:32:32,387
I'm still 25 but yeah

896
02:32:32,983 --> 02:32:37,006
add some so 25 I think

897
02:32:38,904 --> 02:32:46,535
you know it seriously we can spend a very
very long time

898
02:32:47,489 --> 02:32:52,990
I changed the networking layer of the of the
OS

899
02:32:54,449 --> 02:32:58,884
yeah Red Hats Red Hats Reds trade for
Enterprise stuff

900
02:32:59,442 --> 02:33:05,682
it's not great it's it's what's useless but
that way so

901
02:33:06,921 --> 02:33:12,301
if you have on a mall Hy-Vee ad

902
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:21,249
yeah I did that already they're all the same
again I mean we didn't already is Affordable
for this already

903
02:33:27,114 --> 02:33:34,555
cell oh fuck I basically a parent and not a
command

904
02:33:37,914 --> 02:33:51,264
and then I got 15 they have the same now
that the same either at address and the same
IP address and that that is completely out
of my realm of reality I have never seen
that before

905
02:33:53,708 --> 02:34:00,974
that's what I'm trying to say they have the
same package rest I know that's what I don't
understand

906
02:34:01,522 --> 02:34:09,135
I do not understand how they have the same
week we were noticing that earlier lvg no
actually won't notice that so

907
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:12,867
I don't know that's why I'm saying so fucked
up we have to figure it out

908
02:34:13,472 --> 02:34:26,318
I don't know bigger bigger a couple friends
about can fix any of that. So maybe I'll
help ya there this is oh God arcade that's
fantastic let's go ahead and look at this
one

909
02:34:27,121 --> 02:34:30,816
yeah this is okay so

910
02:34:31,572 --> 02:34:47,557
this is really fucking weird this is what it
is this put this out there this is from a
fucking where the reason that I didn't
notice right away is I would never ever look
for the system's having in the same or a
dress

911
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:52,228
I I mean I don't even know how that thing is
fucking working

912
02:34:52,933 --> 02:35:17,772
I mean that's just so unusual is really
unusual Ray Grant gives vm's same our
address and I'm going to I'm going to
document this because I have to come back to
this for the next poor Schmo who asked if
you hit this issue god dammit

913
02:35:21,092 --> 02:35:22,940
coffee

914
02:35:29,672 --> 02:35:31,831
oh God

915
02:35:41,365 --> 02:35:43,353
should

916
02:35:49,647 --> 02:35:55,577
Linus Tech tips latest Linus Tech tips at it
again

917
02:35:58,083 --> 02:35:59,951
all right

918
02:36:03,847 --> 02:36:06,982
thank you for finding this arcade

919
02:36:07,332 --> 02:36:30,174
I'm just putting in my like I just want to
lose your legs before they scroll off it's
it's one of the advantages of having a tiny
Community I can actually keep up with the
chat and I suppose it's the strange VM world
we live in and where Mac addresses are no
longer unique

920
02:36:30,177 --> 02:36:32,091
at all

921
02:36:32,091 --> 02:36:46,313
everything here you can have the same
address here you can have the same address
and you we can all share Mac addresses in
this peace love and Lennox kind of world
it's fucked up

922
02:36:46,314 --> 02:37:02,452
Burger you can even assigned the same IP at
Mark's address to two things and still have
them not to blow up is just remarkable to me
oh I'm not complaining I think this is
really fun actually

923
02:37:01,092 --> 02:37:07,481
is really fun actually it's it's it's
blowing my real reality

924
02:37:10,446 --> 02:37:17,055
it has to be Let It Be Alex tags devices to
static Mac address yeah

925
02:37:22,922 --> 02:37:25,460
so this is one that says what

926
02:37:28,619 --> 02:37:48,040
Baker's the same as him if actress to 2 p.m.
what is going on is this crazy it's an issue
that's created by the Box you are using sent
to a 6 bucks in the box is Vigor and file it
is it is hard coating at the base Mac used
by the Guess

927
02:37:48,043 --> 02:38:12,512
pictures of certificate Magnus you can
prevent this Behavior by adding that you all
can make her file config via base Mac equals
Neil which will result in them being
auto-generated well there's like some
esoteric weird work around and vagrants that
I would never have known had it not been for
my fantastic community

928
02:38:18,670 --> 02:38:20,004
yeah

929
02:38:22,277 --> 02:38:33,723
there is a sense OS / Red Hat bug in the
vagrant

930
02:38:35,846 --> 02:38:43,476
image that forces them to all have the same

931
02:38:44,068 --> 02:38:58,783
Mac and Ivy it wasn't even that they were
getting the same IP they had the same Mac
address and therefore they are all given due
to flee the same IP because there's a
package rest

932
02:38:59,404 --> 02:39:06,517
I look how come I hit this issue I this is
the Story of My Life

933
02:39:06,517 --> 02:39:32,584
the Story of My Life and then people yell at
me and they say you didn't do it wrong you
like you didn't follow proper procedure to
find out all of your errors yours all over
the place can we just can we just pause for
a second and they agree that this was not my
fucking issues this time because I didn't
rush into it or some shit this is like some
random esoteric fuck shit out there that
screwed me over cuz the music redhead that
we can play

934
02:39:33,391 --> 02:39:44,352
is it going to be using a redhead image
looks this place the blame where it belongs
this blame belongs in the people who
maintain the image the vagrant image that
I'm using right

935
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:51,665
so it's so

936
02:39:56,553 --> 02:40:03,371
okay by the way this is not a red hat

937
02:40:04,273 --> 02:40:13,734
issue it's a vagrant red hat image issue

938
02:40:14,078 --> 02:40:18,840
I suspect so

939
02:40:19,519 --> 02:40:24,944
it is mxp nice to know it makes me it makes
me feel good to know that I'm not fucking
going insane

940
02:40:27,995 --> 02:40:30,454
the base Mac equals no

941
02:40:31,363 --> 02:40:37,168
who would think that you would have to say I
don't want that I want to kill my Mac
address to write

942
02:40:38,737 --> 02:40:45,991
I'm here to find all these esoteric
weird-ass shity things so that you don't
have to

943
02:40:46,852 --> 02:40:57,971
yeah we're going to start all over with an
FS from scratch because

944
02:40:58,005 --> 02:41:07,418
networking is a think I kind of want to tell
it what network and to use with let's just
go ahead and check out all this stuff and
start over showing

945
02:41:11,736 --> 02:41:15,378
wait what wait what

946
02:41:16,036 --> 02:41:19,986
I'm just killing stuff with wild abandon

947
02:41:22,618 --> 02:41:42,530
RPC hey look at look at all the network
Diagnostics I just learned that I had
totally forgot about before that I'm now
where that I need to Deep dive into the hole
NM thing you know the RPC reminder that
Howard BC Services work and how they relate
to and it

948
02:41:41,429 --> 02:41:47,952
and if I passed another Services user PC all
of that stuff is like been a great reminder
so

949
02:42:01,385 --> 02:42:09,228
alright what are we going to do here we're
going to do yeah

950
02:42:09,863 --> 02:42:13,135
they received this is my other one that I
was looking at

951
02:42:14,014 --> 02:42:25,336
I am trying to simplify here cuz cuz cuz the
reasons I feel like I can get a grip on
reality again all right time to throw should
I weigh

952
02:42:26,735 --> 02:42:29,730
time to throw the sheet away

953
02:42:32,749 --> 02:42:36,363
oh hell yeah he kidding me

954
02:42:37,578 --> 02:42:44,472
vagrant destroy this okay so first things
first

955
02:42:45,595 --> 02:42:50,584
the first thing here is I would not have had
this issue had have been doing physical
machines

956
02:42:50,735 --> 02:42:58,706
Heaven is a physical machines with actual
Nick's this would not have happened I would
have had other issues but not this

957
02:42:59,096 --> 02:43:21,099
I wouldn't think so this is an issue that
was brought about because of her some
machines and I I want to take a moment to
just take stock of that yeah this this world
of magical virtualization provides a lot of
amazing things but it also sucks you up in
this case because if

958
02:43:21,908 --> 02:43:38,395
you know that this is this entire last hour
that I just lost was because of
virtualization and I would not have lost
that our so the time one by virtualization
over here doing all the stuff with physical
devices

959
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:47,004
is in some sense also kind of paid back by
look up since for some position so you know

960
02:43:47,111 --> 02:44:03,782
if you like backing away from this whole
problem address those kinds of things when
you go back make it up that I'm going to
walk away all this comes up and the first
thing I'm going to look at it to see if they
have the same address that's going to be
very interesting I'll be right back

961
02:48:37,756 --> 02:48:39,769
and just it just dumb

962
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:54,274
cuz in the boxes bigger than 10 gigabytes
Elroy

963
02:48:56,586 --> 02:49:04,430
it's freezing it's freezing here and they
are

964
02:49:05,627 --> 02:49:12,688
I just lay down a whole new layer of snow
you like new snowfall

965
02:49:32,430 --> 02:49:42,978
I think there's a way to make it not import
every time right you can use that link thing
I saw Megan setting called link something
and it keeps it from importing

966
02:49:49,189 --> 02:49:53,669
can I shrink Megan primary disc fine

967
02:49:56,923 --> 02:50:02,573
I thought you had to have that to have a
secondary disk obviously I was wrong

968
02:50:13,962 --> 02:50:20,257
actually I think the primary just found this
is 70 GB ridiculously high thing

969
02:51:28,224 --> 02:51:33,034
Ellen close app yeah you found outside
looking for

970
02:51:36,189 --> 02:51:41,181
yeah I was just I actually I read briefly
about it yesterday

971
02:51:43,327 --> 02:51:48,039
I'm learning way more than I want to buy
Baker probably time I go through all the
docks a l b g

972
02:51:50,339 --> 02:51:56,457
maybe you should read all the documents Mi
to the fuck out I know

973
02:52:02,989 --> 02:52:04,492
not right now

974
02:52:13,996 --> 02:52:15,767
as a provider thing right

975
02:52:23,349 --> 02:52:25,060
then provide a thing

976
02:52:26,612 --> 02:52:32,629
now

977
02:52:33,364 --> 02:52:40,502
well we tried I don't know if it needs to be
in a provider or not

978
02:53:16,101 --> 02:53:22,805
complete I just want to eat in your in your
ear

979
02:53:42,898 --> 02:53:49,458
they haven't seen my peace still Hey Joe

980
02:53:51,886 --> 02:53:58,822
they have different Mac addresses though
different Mac addresses

981
02:54:01,801 --> 02:54:07,953
nothing first step Lexi

982
02:54:08,685 --> 02:54:10,309
car wash

983
02:54:17,998 --> 02:54:20,630
prep user

984
02:54:22,308 --> 02:54:27,832
back to you but we can't I mean I actually
think we can fix that by setting the network

985
02:54:28,367 --> 02:54:36,819
I think if we use the vagrant network
settings don't want to try that first or do
you want to do and I'm so I do what I can
try to fix this by hand just cuz fun cuz fun

986
02:54:38,038 --> 02:54:43,053
I think this is because it's their static
IPS but now we have our progresses right

987
02:54:43,332 --> 02:54:47,602
so what I'm guessing is that

988
02:54:54,029 --> 02:55:00,912
I don't know Bill I don't know cuz I'm brand
new to all this so we're just experimenting
with all that

989
02:55:01,116 --> 02:55:05,920
I'm getting surprised everyday so

990
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:12,877
I feel like we need to do networking here
just call it a day

991
02:55:13,748 --> 02:55:15,647
this right here

992
02:55:15,647 --> 02:55:23,418
I think the fact that we don't set the
private Network means it is to DHCP means
it's not using DHCP

993
02:55:23,419 --> 02:55:28,892
as this is why I think it's happy I think
the default doesn't have this

994
02:55:31,393 --> 02:55:33,745
yep there it is right there

995
02:55:35,694 --> 02:55:42,507
the default private number type is host only
Network because those are the easiest to
work with

996
02:55:41,695 --> 02:55:46,466
and where's the boxes you can create
multiple social networks it is possible to
specify

997
02:55:47,834 --> 02:55:55,711
it's supposed to say which was the only
Network you want a bigger box for by giving
her face to do this the name argument the
name name hostname Enterprise use

998
02:55:56,019 --> 02:56:00,333
so I think that's what's happening

999
02:56:02,384 --> 02:56:06,161
how's it going what how do you say the name

1000
02:56:09,164 --> 02:56:16,853
just like 9 years old 18 freshman majoring
in CS

1001
02:56:19,687 --> 02:56:27,678
nicest shark I don't know about changing
your major way to go by if you go by Jacque
joking

1002
02:56:28,923 --> 02:56:31,845
yeah that's a that's an important thing to
know

1003
02:56:33,696 --> 02:56:39,750
BMT said it much better than me pudding is
not computer science

1004
02:56:39,951 --> 02:56:46,082
computer science enables coding but you
won't learn how to code a sunspots very
rarely

1005
02:56:46,495 --> 02:56:50,069
so if you want to actually do something
practical

1006
02:56:50,952 --> 02:57:07,162
might want to get out of Cs you might want
to actually study an industry that you want
to be in fashion Pharmaceuticals music study
the industry going to major in the industry
and then learn the coating that goes with
the industry

1007
02:57:07,190 --> 02:57:13,124
don't if the industry you want to get in is
academic computer science and Quantum
computing

1008
02:57:13,217 --> 02:57:19,524
or writing programming languages and things
like that then computer science make sense
otherwise it doesn't make any sense

1009
02:57:20,156 --> 02:57:23,653
you want to you know you have to decide what
you want to do

1010
02:57:23,726 --> 02:57:28,728
it's like it's like majoring in carpentry
right

1011
02:57:30,861 --> 02:57:32,244
hey Sean

1012
02:57:38,577 --> 02:57:41,600
they're not even the same network I don't
think they are

1013
02:57:44,125 --> 02:57:52,630
why is he has yeah if you can find something
is applied or the major that I like is
computer engineering

1014
02:57:54,696 --> 02:57:59,730
my friend my my friend that I've met her for
a long time game

1015
02:58:00,744 --> 02:58:11,751
he's in he's in a computer engineering major
and it's really cool it's really practical
it's like electronical engineering with
regard to computer science

1016
02:58:12,390 --> 02:58:20,123
I don't know I think this has to be
explicitly provided

1017
02:58:28,524 --> 02:58:32,340
all right let's go for this virtualbox
Wholesale in that works

1018
02:58:40,567 --> 02:58:44,334
but I be a dad and and to try to Ping

1019
02:58:45,618 --> 02:58:49,580
yeah we can try that goddamn I

1020
02:58:49,580 --> 02:58:55,094
I know that that's a lot of work that I
don't want to do

1021
02:58:55,408 --> 02:59:10,466
I'm at 8 Saturday I want to get to the NFL
stuff I need to stop fucking around
everything I like it at 6. I love your
guys's help but I want to get past this I
got to get used to the point which other
Provisions in a guy pees like it's supposed
to

1022
02:59:12,741 --> 02:59:17,120
if your engineering no I don't

1023
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:33,584
I mean if you do computer engineering you'll
not only get electrical engineering skills
but it'll be a computer science skills and
coding skills you learn seeing you learn
assembly and then you can take it up from
there you go you python I can do any of you
can do forensics you do security or do
anything

1024
02:59:33,585 --> 02:59:42,815
have you had computer engineer near me that
does the sky's the limit after that got two
new magic double major with Computer
Engineering and computer science and
cybersecurity

1025
02:59:43,018 --> 02:59:53,553
if you get a double major in line Computer
Engineering and cybersecurity forensics oh
my God the phone and you'll be fine and zero
days within a within a year of that

1026
02:59:59,075 --> 03:00:02,606
this is generic L8

1027
03:00:08,410 --> 03:00:17,311
yeah if you can figure this out let me know
you're the boss of me and you know what's up
with this stuff you've been very helpful and
BJ definitely earned your VIP

1028
03:00:17,312 --> 03:00:22,540
your VIP is a vault dweller nicer appreciate
the help I'm going to try it

1029
03:00:21,488 --> 03:00:25,563
I'm going to try it with some more generic
allegra fell hell yeah

1030
03:00:37,570 --> 03:00:54,219
yeah me too me too but I want to get to the
other side will have something more useful
tomorrow

1031
03:00:55,418 --> 03:00:59,628
I'll be documenting like my my what I
discovered along the way

1032
03:01:00,544 --> 03:01:04,498
yeah yeah just like screwing around with it
take you to work

1033
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:14,363
it's like hacking without hacking new swine
understand that works you know

1034
03:01:18,344 --> 03:01:24,293
what's schedule I think I might schedule cuz
they don't follow anything on the schedule
and BMV

1035
03:01:25,717 --> 03:01:31,353
tomorrow it's on it's on if you go to if you
go to / schedule is still there

1036
03:01:32,365 --> 03:01:37,176
I used the I'm using the twist schedule now
yeah I know I'm sad right

1037
03:01:38,097 --> 03:01:41,013
yeah. Did you go to

1038
03:01:45,286 --> 03:01:47,837
no man if you go to

1039
03:01:50,669 --> 03:01:53,414
slash schedule Hey look

1040
03:01:56,160 --> 03:02:01,804
there's really only the only two things on
this guy got to look at this is so fun as I
can all the stuff I did this week

1041
03:02:06,043 --> 03:02:14,043
yeah so the only I have learn easy we're
going to DC tomorrow night at 11

1042
03:02:14,068 --> 03:02:21,458
all day I would love to have you here for
that if you're here original 5 hours of sea
tomorrow so

1043
03:02:22,583 --> 03:02:30,970
actually how many how many more days do we
have I think we only have two more days to
get through the whole book we're not going
to make it but

1044
03:02:31,572 --> 03:02:40,870
yeah we have two more weeks we have 10 total
hours to get through this ebook we're going
to start doing community's applications
development boost on

1045
03:02:40,937 --> 03:02:44,195
Saturday the 5th because that's the new
calendar

1046
03:02:44,832 --> 03:02:49,754
and I kind of want to stick to this annual
calendar as best I can

1047
03:02:49,976 --> 03:03:11,815
and I will be making adjustments as we go
and we'll definitely go through that for C
faster next year but you know people boosted
that's old point right and get them get them
gone and they can make blasteroids compare
notes with other people do these on the
schedule though because I have the I have to
get certified before to July right after all
that money way

1048
03:03:11,817 --> 03:03:16,689
cell so that's that's counter

1049
03:03:19,476 --> 03:03:28,495
and here is my crazy ass I have a feeling
that if I set up my networking

1050
03:03:28,551 --> 03:03:33,098
explicitly that is going to get past all the
problems we've been having

1051
03:03:33,936 --> 03:03:38,131
I don't know that for sure though so we're
going to go figure that out

1052
03:03:45,511 --> 03:03:49,990
we have been doing a lot of it if it's stuff
that I want to throw that out but

1053
03:03:50,156 --> 03:03:54,556
we need to we need to change the networking

1054
03:03:56,428 --> 03:04:11,612
and every single example I've ever read on
bigger it has the networking explicitly
defined and I think that might have been
causing everybody to bypass the years that
I've been having like supposed to be sending
JCP instead of host base

1055
03:04:11,613 --> 03:04:26,326
but I'd rather not add static IP so
definitely you know what

1056
03:04:28,504 --> 03:04:33,374
if we have static IP that's going to fix the
other provisioning issue as well

1057
03:04:33,375 --> 03:04:41,043
no talking about because now we know what
the eye peas are yeah

1058
03:04:44,913 --> 03:04:52,175
oh my God is awesome that looks so fantastic

1059
03:04:52,301 --> 03:04:59,428
yeah I I I ride fast but I'm a mess

1060
03:05:00,164 --> 03:05:02,526
I'm pondering this situation because

1061
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:09,897
situation because if we're going to send a
pin at first we have to know the eye peas
nothing know the IP of the NFS Mount point

1062
03:05:10,419 --> 03:05:11,783
so

1063
03:05:13,268 --> 03:05:34,928
I'm really glad you mentioned that because
if we if I go down the path of like setting
up me to no default IP DHCP networking
through vagrant I have no predictable method
of using the IPS and therefore can't
provision things like anifest using a
persistent internet using an unknown IP
address if I do static IP

1064
03:05:35,987 --> 03:05:40,511
I know well those numbers are and I can put
them in my provisioning script

1065
03:05:42,253 --> 03:05:46,464
then say maybe is me

1066
03:05:52,804 --> 03:05:58,418
you think it's built into the unique is
Baker anything is built into the image I bet
it's in the image

1067
03:06:00,303 --> 03:06:05,706
let me know if it's amazing how do we how do
we set the static IP in the provision Crypt

1068
03:06:08,112 --> 03:06:12,397
is that something I was hoping that I need
to do it though

1069
03:06:49,905 --> 03:06:53,178
8288 e

1070
03:07:07,202 --> 03:07:08,908
are we looking at

1071
03:07:17,531 --> 03:07:19,785
vagrant destroy

1072
03:07:24,489 --> 03:07:26,056
nope

1073
03:07:38,439 --> 03:07:43,368
I'm here we go a private Network

1074
03:08:12,792 --> 03:08:16,854
prominent organelle supplies used to be
sober and has its own step dad

1075
03:08:18,309 --> 03:08:30,259
he's given the private owned Vehicles still
get an IP address from the IP space so we
can access to be a recluse and happy for the
hostess of your pride or hustling and
working favorite the static IP address to
open a big of a file to following

1076
03:08:32,070 --> 03:08:34,618
going to uncommon it

1077
03:08:40,236 --> 03:08:43,109
I mean replace strip

1078
03:08:48,883 --> 03:08:56,578
take a private Onsen I work in favor of a
secretary telephone line uncommented

1079
03:09:01,588 --> 03:09:05,934
is that set the network IP for this
particular VM

1080
03:09:06,486 --> 03:09:10,690
I need to I need the income at the number by
one or something

1081
03:09:15,444 --> 03:09:26,907
do you want to see a medically-induced if
you modify see you can set the IP
specifically on the private Network

1082
03:09:27,211 --> 03:09:30,065
that's actually what we want to do

1083
03:09:32,684 --> 03:09:39,392
I mean I guess it used to be for the workers
and then I could sit for the control I could
set the IP to be a specific number

1084
03:09:39,393 --> 03:09:43,673
yeah we just make sure it's on the same just
make sure it's on the same address right

1085
03:09:49,528 --> 03:09:52,124
where I can file for the following line and
gun

1086
03:09:53,439 --> 03:10:01,432
I meant to make you just recited them in
order to find the IP of emu needed to SSH
into it and use IP cam in so

1087
03:10:05,067 --> 03:10:08,576
I think this is a default but I'm going to
add it just to be check

1088
03:10:11,537 --> 03:10:18,572
and by the way it is taking so long to
provision it should not take that long

1089
03:10:25,909 --> 03:10:27,121
my weather

1090
03:10:33,996 --> 03:10:38,192
I don't know what if we did all of them that
way

1091
03:10:40,782 --> 03:10:48,710
I don't think we need bass Michael's know I
just think we need to be at Dave sleepy pics
of working longer for vision

1092
03:11:02,380 --> 03:11:05,145
I said Charles sit through all this again

1093
03:11:17,551 --> 03:11:24,024
make a note watch this go go go

1094
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:39,141
say what we learn a lot about bigger than
all this is happening hey looking at
generating Mac address for Nat networking

1095
03:11:40,448 --> 03:11:43,151
setting the name to blah

1096
03:11:44,634 --> 03:11:51,567
this is some static IP a look at that
adapter 10 solihull sound like that's
different than you had before

1097
03:11:57,346 --> 03:12:12,631
I knew I am going to send some static IP
snacks that's can be the next thing I want
to see what DHCP address is what it gives it
because it's what I'm thinking of doing is
setting a static IP on the control in the
one with the NFS amount and then

1098
03:12:12,865 --> 03:12:19,234
and then let him know when to pick up from
DHCP weather for I don't know

1099
03:12:21,201 --> 03:12:23,267
I do not know

1100
03:12:38,311 --> 03:12:45,183
it's on acrylic or God damn it's cold

1101
03:12:45,183 --> 03:12:48,108
as cold where's my blanket

1102
03:12:53,442 --> 03:12:59,975
for freezing and because it's like 3 in the
morning

1103
03:13:00,869 --> 03:13:07,532
I got to put this on my legs I need my long
underwear on so I need

1104
03:13:07,532 --> 03:13:09,485
that's what I really need

1105
03:13:11,255 --> 03:13:16,032
I hope everybody's having a great evening

1106
03:13:17,015 --> 03:13:23,927
I'm having a blast this is really fun I
can't I've been wanting to do this stuff for
a long time so

1107
03:13:26,864 --> 03:13:32,221
if I get in good with Baker and I think is
is worth it

1108
03:13:32,447 --> 03:13:36,902
I can't imagine doing all of the same stuff
with ansible as well

1109
03:13:37,283 --> 03:13:42,247
you only can imagine doing automating the
creation of volumes with ansible

1110
03:13:43,863 --> 03:13:50,058
how would you even do that it's a VM thing
you know

1111
03:13:53,047 --> 03:14:01,422
but that alone makes me like more prone to
I'm going back and forth is like a love-hate
relationship with ansible I mean with with
vagrant right

1112
03:14:03,022 --> 03:14:09,094
is it for an STD and it doesn't interesting

1113
03:14:09,289 --> 03:14:18,200
interested thank you for sharing that haven
that's that's like an advantage for using
Linux right it's because it doesn't do is
have her game

1114
03:14:19,883 --> 03:14:22,613
is images of a green. Or. or

1115
03:14:25,488 --> 03:14:32,780
that be fun to try and be trying this on a
Mac as well pretty soon

1116
03:14:34,302 --> 03:14:42,963
I think I broke it I'm wondering whether
this is the reason I'm going through is
afraid to decide whether to use hyper kit on
Mac or to use virtualbox

1117
03:14:43,537 --> 03:14:50,858
cuz you can only I'm pretty sure you can
only have 1 hypervisor install it one time
and running at the same time I guess

1118
03:14:51,540 --> 03:15:03,622
now they know because it delivered problem
but that was I had virtualbox running and I
was trying to deliver at stuff and one of
them was using the hypervisor and it
wouldn't let it until I shut down all the
other stuff on the box

1119
03:15:05,747 --> 03:15:08,719
know that being everywhere why

1120
03:15:11,074 --> 03:15:14,082
why should I be using no. Everywhere and
everywhere

1121
03:15:20,605 --> 03:15:22,840
no. VM provider

1122
03:15:33,633 --> 03:15:38,784
alrighty I wasn't sure you could actually
change that

1123
03:15:44,024 --> 03:15:47,282
I bet you that's more than everything was
all fucked up

1124
03:15:50,840 --> 03:15:56,979
that's why I have three more diapers instead
of one year yeah let me try that

1125
03:15:58,970 --> 03:16:03,723
Renegade X PNG is Angela a single large be
in

1126
03:16:04,474 --> 03:16:10,143
cruising with that yeah that's what I've
been trying to do that kind of thing as well

1127
03:16:14,828 --> 03:16:19,225
I don't want any cleanup destroy Vegas get
you mad at me

1128
03:16:29,719 --> 03:16:36,599
you know I got two boxes at least twice as
slow as liver is a liver provider

1129
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:40,038
hey look and only has one of them for now

1130
03:16:43,212 --> 03:16:45,543
why is it doing host only

1131
03:16:58,073 --> 03:17:05,396
just tell her to box interesting it's a
different

1132
03:17:06,665 --> 03:17:20,914
ever be able to use hyper kit and minikube
for stuff but I'm going to I'm pretty sure
I'm going to be recommending virtualbox for
everything just because it's so Universal it
might have bugs and stuff but it's really
coming across os's

1133
03:17:20,916 --> 03:17:23,970
you know so I don't know

1134
03:17:26,907 --> 03:17:29,695
I don't know what I do there

1135
03:17:46,754 --> 03:17:49,604
do The Offspring of civilians are greyed out

1136
03:17:50,244 --> 03:17:55,065
I did it with half of you being installed
but I haven't been able to the sun assault
yeah

1137
03:17:55,143 --> 03:18:03,065
I think you're right it's that's that's
you're talking about Windows right yeah I
think you're right

1138
03:18:03,066 --> 03:18:08,418
I think if you do wsl2 it automatically
burns your hyper-v

1139
03:18:08,889 --> 03:18:14,500
I could be wrong on that that's changed so
many times in the past 3 years

1140
03:18:14,501 --> 03:18:26,001
it was a time when you live when VMware on
virtualbox I mean sorry and we have so too
can exist coexist in a VMware change
everything I think that same poor thing
happened with her two box but hell no

1141
03:18:26,497 --> 03:18:33,318
it's the second such a moving Target yeah

1142
03:18:33,318 --> 03:18:41,909
I'm almost positive that wsl2 burns your
hyper-v it is soon as you do that you can't
do anything else

1143
03:18:41,910 --> 03:18:49,328
and then you get VMware VMware because the
professional product they came out with a
version of it that supports is being on
there

1144
03:18:49,329 --> 03:19:00,320
and I don't know what they do and they
probably detect with her W so she's in the
hyper-v and use w72 instead it's only thing
they can do because there's only one thing
can use the hypervisor

1145
03:19:00,321 --> 03:19:08,274
so that be interesting to figure
outinteresting to figure out sugar down
there

1146
03:19:15,456 --> 03:19:23,520
this is taking longer cuz I did all that I
did all the software installation to
provisional is stuff

1147
03:19:24,207 --> 03:19:32,234
yeah I could have used an image or I
probably will do it this is I wonder if I
could just back her to make an image and
then use to put that image up

1148
03:19:33,766 --> 03:19:35,484
I bet you I could do that

1149
03:19:36,308 --> 03:19:47,191
I bet you I could use Packer to make an
image that has all the stuff this snapshot
that I want and then use that instead of
having to do all of this you know I am up
grade stuff

1150
03:19:48,167 --> 03:19:56,630
installing a message if you pass through
when it's been I thought I did I didn't 2013
inside play Dota 2 on my Linux machine cuz
it was Windows only

1151
03:19:57,965 --> 03:20:08,096
we just gave maker which is when there's
only two years of that pass-through it's
been harder for me to figure out I haven't
been able to figure out how to do that

1152
03:20:08,526 --> 03:20:13,745
lately but the games that I player are
Lennox support it anyway all of them

1153
03:20:14,273 --> 03:20:18,647
Witcher Witcher is it Windows only thing but
it proton works just fine

1154
03:20:19,254 --> 03:20:26,704
I'm tempted to go play a little bit right
now I want to get this to work though this
is like super super interesting

1155
03:20:26,705 --> 03:20:34,677
hey how's it going to John's I trust his

doing it on a physical system

1163

is it have zero debt it's a it's it's bad
for the economy to have zero dead

brought to you by Mozzy K thank you Marcus
again for buy me my plushie keeps my heart
rate down I'm going to live an extra year
because of this

1174
03:22:56,662 --> 03:23:03,174
getting at least terminal good for you
here's some

1175
03:23:03,174 --> 03:23:06,645
I don't mean to sound condescending I really
don't

1176
03:23:06,767 --> 03:23:11,710
kind of plushie this is a special plushie

1177
03:23:11,710 --> 03:23:15,002
yeah it purrs

1178

or you can get a plushie or 2 or 10 or 50

1184
03:23:46,939 --> 03:23:54,764
Lego age on that's that's that's my take on
Terminal if you want to learn Linux terminal
and go watch that made a whole bunch of
videos

1185
03:23:55,164 --> 03:23:59,368
you can take it or leave it but I made him
and go watch him

1186
03:24:01,335 --> 03:24:14,076
and we do it again we're going to do we can
do this again on May 4th so Saturday is a
beginner Dame Saturdays are boost days 11 to
load of whatever 3 meeting tomorrow didn't
see

shit

1201
03:26:24,191 --> 03:26:31,600
please finish it you and your mat are you on
a Windows machine you are

1202
03:26:34,526 --> 03:26:41,571
look at the guy these control ends this is
his character during this means somebody
edited this thing on a Windows machine

1203
03:26:41,915 --> 03:26:44,907
which is unacceptable

1204
03:26:45,680 --> 03:26:52,489
so so we will steal your ideas and write
them here in a proper way

1205
03:26:52,568 --> 03:26:55,798
it's with an X

1206
03:26:56,950 --> 03:27:02,371
yeah I know I didn't know you could do two
of the same time

1207
03:27:02,372 --> 03:27:05,594
I'm learning more Ruby everyday

1208
03:27:05,594 --> 03:27:16,253
I knew it really well once upon a time and I
just do not remember a single fucking thing
that's the same that's the same that's not
the same

1209
03:27:16,254 --> 03:27:24,426
best magazine will you skip the gcp stuff
right right my turn this off for a second

1210
03:27:24,427 --> 03:27:31,916
where's the Vox Lynx cloned truly Peace by
the way

1211
03:27:31,916 --> 03:27:35,863
so yeah it was unfortunate

1212
03:27:35,863 --> 03:27:43,478
a passkey Peru to to to-do to do at work

1213
03:27:43,957 --> 03:27:48,561
but where did you put this you put it in
here right

1214
03:27:49,926 --> 03:27:57,729
all right when I say how did you know I'm
going to run into Network

1215
03:28:01,763 --> 03:28:09,691
it is an object can write each of the next I
did not know this I did not know this

1216
03:28:09,692 --> 03:28:18,049
distro Unix it's what's your exam I using
star Starks do you speak Russian or French

1217
03:28:19,720 --> 03:28:26,386
you can change it I don't think I don't
think I can though you know what

1218
03:28:27,312 --> 03:28:33,669
can I get can I give it IP to the host
Network and then just haven't been on the
same thing

1219
03:28:34,188 --> 03:28:40,729
I could write you're mean

1220
03:28:44,903 --> 03:28:47,353
Odessa Unix yes I know but that one

1221
03:28:47,791 --> 03:28:56,562
nothing else yes yes yes thank you now I'm
yeah I totally forgot about that it's an
ancient tool he can also just do that with
like any basic filter

1222
03:28:57,326 --> 03:29:04,241
command so yep that's really cool let's just
say I want to see what

1223
03:29:04,983 --> 03:29:11,050
I want to see we ended up with though so are
our thing is finished running Ice I believe

1224
03:29:14,792 --> 03:29:22,777
where are we is it for no it's some

1225
03:29:22,877 --> 03:29:29,317
and then where is it if they don't have
anymore all right let's go

1226
03:29:29,747 --> 03:29:33,277
some sexy itis yeah that's one

1227
03:29:35,119 --> 03:29:47,396
and if you see Bridget working yeah but I
really don't care they just going to be able
to vagrants status we should have three
systems up hip

1228
03:29:48,608 --> 03:29:53,583
where's my for Loop for I control or i p g

1229
03:29:57,313 --> 03:30:03,111
i mean rip ivy

1230
03:30:05,749 --> 03:30:07,613
qh0

1231
03:30:11,392 --> 03:30:13,771
yeah he was in 2 p.m.

1232
03:30:15,709 --> 03:30:19,509
nothing new no no dice

1233
03:30:20,606 --> 03:30:25,687
all right so this is not resend you a piece
which I didn't expect it to not understand
how that works

1234
03:30:25,833 --> 03:30:31,895
but I thought it would be worth a look we
decided to do CPT at 10 do it

1235
03:30:36,409 --> 03:30:39,653
and what was the scary about this doctor

1236
03:30:44,408 --> 03:30:50,356
oh wow it totally it is it tastes if he
works

1237
03:30:51,751 --> 03:30:54,493
dish DP totally works

1238
03:30:57,078 --> 03:31:00,644
if you do it again

1239
03:31:08,793 --> 03:31:15,711
I think your ETA 27% better that's weird

1240
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:26,654
I find this interesting why is this one
still there

1241
03:31:28,662 --> 03:31:41,376
so this is the DHCP route to God about it
and I got picked up for my local internal
Network by the way that's really cool you
know that means that means that the because
my IP is on that as well

1242
03:31:43,883 --> 03:31:48,710
yeah yep C

1243
03:31:48,854 --> 03:31:56,081
I'm on the one I sent 16 a number that means
that means that it picked up the DHCP from

1244
03:31:56,118 --> 03:32:03,460
I want to say from my internal my internal
IP server

1245
03:32:11,414 --> 03:32:16,720
asme interfaces on here because the
virtualization started hard to know but

1246
03:32:20,640 --> 03:32:26,572
yeah when I said what she say you made a
pawn game in a code awesome

1247
03:32:29,198 --> 03:32:42,158
is this 24 yeah it is so different I just
think I'm confused by his why does it still
have the $10 address you see that

1248
03:32:43,427 --> 03:32:57,112
and I know we're kind of like you know just
just like playing with the mysteries of
networking right now but why did it still
allocate attend. No org I think the 10th.
Network must have been a part of the image

1249
03:32:58,424 --> 03:33:04,111
what do you think hitting the 10. Networks
and you need to 10. Networks need to buy it

1250
03:33:04,609 --> 03:33:10,556
it's okay this is this is this is the
address that was assigned 9 10 11

1251
03:33:10,878 --> 03:33:14,190
3 days to pee and that is a

1252
03:33:15,266 --> 03:33:22,755
and we and I had different internet
addresses course so I'm pretty sure the
other festival at work now but I like your
about your way better

1253
03:33:23,706 --> 03:33:31,519
never seen her face is always at her face
they're both that interfaces

1254
03:33:39,712 --> 03:33:41,776
let me think about that for a second

1255
03:33:49,182 --> 03:33:51,109
okay I think you're saying

1256
03:33:51,939 --> 03:34:04,068
are you saying you're saying that all three
hosts are as if they're on an internal
Network and the knotted then that is
external facing IP is 10. 2. 15 is what have
the same one

1257
03:34:04,918 --> 03:34:10,580
okay that makes sense I am looking in the
verse of ox

1258
03:34:10,853 --> 03:34:18,700
so that's what this is let me know we can go
in and look around some more

1259
03:34:21,430 --> 03:34:26,159
oh oh oh oh

1260
03:34:27,079 --> 03:34:33,197
but I'm just wondering normally when
something is normally when something is not
it in here

1261
03:34:34,851 --> 03:34:40,923
it means that it has an IP that's

1262
03:34:41,275 --> 03:34:55,843
internal to this machine and then you know
there's some sort of common IP for the
machine that but brokers in but the fact
that they have the same IP makes it there's
some extra level of

1263
03:34:56,514 --> 03:35:10,639
there's some extra Network layer inside of
the computer the second that within the net
sort of thing going on it seems like to me
but I don't know yet. I see that the first
one is not

1264
03:35:11,949 --> 03:35:19,579
and the second adapter is the house only
adapter view box net that's interesting

1265
03:35:22,564 --> 03:35:28,129
I'm still in a

1266
03:35:32,994 --> 03:35:35,940
at the school high school it doesn't matter
fault

1267
03:35:53,914 --> 03:36:00,768
alright so

1268
03:36:00,768 --> 03:36:03,921
so that's good that's good we're making
progress

1269
03:36:04,601 --> 03:36:38,361
that's really knows what she was just added
to your truck so I got to get that right now
okay so that's that's when I saw that it's
like vagrant has its own that in addition to
that to the other one and that's that's what
it has to do with the problem with this is I
can't predict that it's always going to be a
one 92.9 the address and less I mess with my
DHCP ride or something I don't want to do
that so I'm going to redo this one last time
and after that I'll probably give up for the
evening I mean it's been really fun

1270
03:36:38,365 --> 03:36:39,758
and

1271
03:36:39,758 --> 03:36:49,949
I really really like that you're assigning
the IP to an exact number because then I can
know the number and I can use it in the
controller

1272
03:36:49,950 --> 03:36:57,991
when it in my provisioner and 78 when I
scraped the Manifest up I can I can
hard-coded to those kinds of things

1273
03:37:03,530 --> 03:37:05,677
so yeah

1274
03:37:26,250 --> 03:37:28,914
yeah I'm just thinking here

1275
03:37:29,092 --> 03:37:35,279
yeah I told anybody to buy peas and so you
solved that problem appreciate that

1276
03:37:35,280 --> 03:37:42,515
and let's pray that and if we can actually
go the NFS stuff

1277
03:37:41,278 --> 03:37:53,754
psycho the NFL stuff we can start over with
Benefits tomorrow which is good because I've
been feeling all the RPC stuff and
everything that we are hitting it just going
to all go away just going to all go away and
won't do that little thing again with this
is he

1278
03:37:54,303 --> 03:38:01,316
I'm going to try one more thing and call it
a day

1279
03:38:22,205 --> 03:38:25,143
it's a stew

1280
03:38:27,995 --> 03:38:41,261
no it's two vagrant I'm I'm losing brain
power here and it's time for me to go watch
a movie to go to bed and then I'll come back
bright and early tomorrow and we'll do some
more stuff in at 11 we're going to be doing
see Cody all day

1281
03:38:41,638 --> 03:38:43,434
I'm take this down

1282
03:38:44,323 --> 03:38:54,568
destroy again I'm going to restart it when I
get a break till I pee and after that we're
going to go to town

1283
03:38:55,124 --> 03:39:03,027
and then eventually will strip the F this
creation and all the while will sing A Merry
Little tune

1284
03:39:11,175 --> 03:39:26,364
I'm freezing I really I'm going to go cuddle
with my plushie and watch a movie and fall
asleep I wish I could take you all with me
but I can't watch movies with you cuz twitch
sucks

1285
03:39:26,366 --> 03:39:31,839
actually it's not too much that sucks it's
it's dcrm sucks

1286
03:39:32,521 --> 03:39:38,518
Olivia by watching I have gotten sucked into
this keep them close

1287
03:39:39,763 --> 03:39:52,886
detective British detective kind of thing
this mystery is murder mystery thing I might
kind of sucked into it lately and I I know
it's like it's good it's good it's really
well written

1288
03:39:55,169 --> 03:39:58,540
I got a lot of legs turns into a cinch it

1289
03:40:00,392 --> 03:40:03,522
what was the last thing I watched before
that though

1290
03:40:04,046 --> 03:40:13,947
boost versus Murder She Wrote it kind of is
actually it is it is with a lot more you
know risque

1291
03:40:14,421 --> 03:40:21,016
I just listened to the British accents a
modern modern British accents are so sexy

1292
03:40:21,351 --> 03:40:28,697
I just have to stop and go to lie I just
love listening to it just so much so
pleasant to listen to

1293
03:40:28,698 --> 03:40:34,333
I just makes me realize how harsh American
accents are we are really

1294
03:40:34,388 --> 03:40:41,544
just the bottom of the barrel are are
diphthongs slurs and shit

1295
03:40:41,660 --> 03:40:45,344
I was the one who washed before that I was
watching

1296
03:40:45,344 --> 03:41:01,805
I mean I don't I don't know how I want to
start reading here's a problem I don't see
anybody has this problem but I'm a big I'm
an Avid Reader but I only read when I'm in
the tub and our tub is broken I haven't been
reading

1297
03:41:01,806 --> 03:41:32,185
I know that sounds weird I love to sit in
the tub and read it like you know like a
cliche woman with bon bons is he like an
American like we like those say I don't use
bubble bath or anything but I just like
that's another thing I like to like roll up
and get cozy and read problem is is it by
the time I'm done with the shit like this
I'm staring at the screen here even though
I'm I can't quite explain it but

1298
03:41:32,188 --> 03:41:39,089
I I kind of have an inversion for looking at
text

1299
03:41:39,089 --> 03:41:42,940
it makes no rational sense whatsoever

1300
03:41:42,940 --> 03:41:50,828
glass of wine a good book absolutely
absolutely why does it have to be for women
why can't men do that

1301
03:41:50,841 --> 03:42:04,433
I fucking love that I love it it's one of my
favorite thing and I'm fucking freezing
right now and I'm missing my bathtub my
bathtub doesn't work it doesn't work cuz I
live in this shity apartment

1302
03:42:05,698 --> 03:42:14,028
I have to stop saying that this apartment is
as Apartments go it is not horrible that
I've lived in worse

1303
03:42:14,029 --> 03:42:22,614
but again I also have lived in you know
pretty ritzy area the suburbs for very large
portion of my life I can't wait to get an

1304
03:42:21,303 --> 03:42:25,857
can't wait to get an actual house again can
I just say I'm looking so forward to that

1305
03:42:28,819 --> 03:42:30,869
I'm really looking forward to that

1306
03:42:37,851 --> 03:42:41,001
sigh sigh sigh sigh

1307
03:42:41,761 --> 03:42:46,141
oh Firefox that's what I was watching make
your mama cry

1308
03:42:48,955 --> 03:42:55,279
yeah I'm I'm on exit have it up right now
yeah Firefly

1309
03:42:56,585 --> 03:43:03,588
I was really a very watching Firefly you
talk about Cozy man Firefly is so cozy

1310
03:43:04,636 --> 03:43:09,393
is my son calls it the Western Cowboy Bebop

1311
03:43:12,283 --> 03:44:10,387
I need to watch the original anime Cowboy
Bebop 2 cuz I watch the whole the whole
thing and I never got it you know it's funny
with firefly I got into it I did not get
into the first time I watched it and the
second time I watched it because my wife was
an avid Avid person into it Farscape yeah if
you could do she got so into it as I've come
and give us another try it so I watched it
with different eyes the Brilliance of
firefly is the writing writing is just
amazing it's really really crazy amazing
writing then there's so many little Nuance
mess comments and everything and like the
second time you fire fireflies really really
rewatchable because there's just so much in
there that's like multiple layers is a
couple of doses that are really don't like I
I don't like the which one some episodes of
like really really good compared to I love
the episode where

1312
03:44:10,393 --> 03:44:18,476
Kaylee gets the dress and the girls are
making fun of her and the baron comes over
and put the girls in their place by saying

1313
03:44:18,699 --> 03:44:25,008
and then he says he can't wait to see Kaylee
and goes because I cannot abide useless
people

1314
03:44:26,888 --> 03:45:06,701
play I'm hooked on a shirt I want that on
the shirt man I get out and I cannot abide
useless people and then she has a black
winning over the hearts of all the men
because she knows everything about the
engines shows everything about the engines
of the ships that she's over there on her
big pink dress you know eating all kinds of
food and stuff and just winning the hearts
of all these guys because she knows so much
about about the mechanical energy of the
ship and are they should just so cool that
it's just got such a crazy amazing character
development and I'm a big fan of character
development I I'm a super big sucker for
character development

1315
03:45:06,706 --> 03:45:31,369
it if it's if you send me doesn't have Scott
shallow characters and it just tries to have
somebody run around and shoot everything I
don't get into it as much the reason the
Marvel movies work so well is because of the
character development in my opinion
otherwise our kind of shallow and tinian so
I kept it like if you compare if you can. We
were watching we have HBO Max lately if you
compare like all the hbos stuff too

1316
03:45:31,372 --> 03:45:35,515
are you going to compare all the the DC
stuff right

1317
03:45:35,833 --> 03:45:47,771
I did give her all the DC stuff to the
Marvel stuff the character Generation
generation just did all this just like
non-existent and that's why they suck so bad
and I like just horrible

1318
03:45:47,808 --> 03:46:16,831
but everything else is the same right it's
really pretty look especially Aquaman
Aquaman has like more character generator
and development did some of the other ones
but you know but all this you know the CGI
and and how pretty it is to watch all that
stuff's all there but then it just doesn't
come through with with the character says
that's why I guess my guardians of galaxy
kicked ass that's why they added BatDad of
that kind of thing in Ragnarok and all the
other stuff is just you got to have
characteristic my opinion

1319
03:46:17,274 --> 03:46:36,747
so it's also the reason that all of the the
Star Wars sequels just fell on your fucking
face there was no character moment that's
that's why I like Rogue one so much better
it did so much better at its character
development and Rogue one I feel like we're
going to start that you cared about the
characters

1320
03:46:37,400 --> 03:46:39,955
I was I can't get into it

1321
03:46:39,955 --> 03:46:53,297
I love Rogue one Rogue ones probably white
one of my if not one of us is from in my
all-time favorite Star Wars except for the
very first one but you can't I can't get the
very first ones I love solo

1322
03:46:53,300 --> 03:46:59,603
I love so everybody hated it I loved it I
love solo

1323
03:46:59,604 --> 03:47:03,804
and there's so many people found reasons to
really hate itfind reasons to really hate it
I loved it

1324
03:47:04,420 --> 03:47:11,047
I really really love solo it's yeah I didn't
I still like Rogue one better

1325
03:47:11,288 --> 03:47:19,028
I like Rogue one better because it's a
tragedy it's a tragedy also at the end of
Rogue one ohmygod

1326
03:47:19,253 --> 03:47:22,980
Amy kisses makes my heart just fluttered
like crazy

1327
03:47:24,311 --> 03:47:36,985
the scene the final scene of Rogue one has
got to be one of the best scenes in all of
Star Wars and it's and it's it's the best
scene because it was made in modern times
where they could show violence

1328
03:47:38,041 --> 03:47:48,043
and the reason it's so amazing to a guy who
saw the original Star Wars and 76 you know
20 times as a twelve-year-old is because

1329
03:47:48,071 --> 03:48:12,305
it was when Vader comes through the door
he's so harsh and it's so violent and
there's just so much excitement from the
very first seen the very first scene that's
that's where this ship comes from right
that's where this ship the ship is the very
first scene this is my favorite scene All
Star Wars this very first unit is this this
Corvette is getting blockade-runner right
and

1330
03:48:12,392 --> 03:48:26,048
and Vader boards and everything if it's the
fact that they provided the backstory to
that scene and they made that most amazing
scene in Star Wars even better

1331
03:48:26,174 --> 03:48:30,106
oh oh my God that was just like

1332
03:48:30,654 --> 03:48:57,467
I I thought I was going to come unglued
watching that I was already like crying my
eyes out because you know if you haven't
seen it they die right and and then and I
was so sad because it cuz they died and then
and all this emotion and then I saw that
scene and then immediately made me want to
go watch Star Wars you know A New Hope but
you can't watch A New Hope because Lucas is
a fucking prick

1333
03:48:58,367 --> 03:49:59,146
I hate Lucas I mean he gave us all that shit
but he also fuck this over Lucas ruined my
childhood he like made it so that we could
have watched the original Star Wars anymore
we still can't you still can't get the
fucking original you can't get it you have
to watch that shity kid Teensy they replaced
in there or are you can't get the original
thing that I saw 25 times I don't want any
of your remastered fuck shit I just want the
original give me the original he wouldn't
even give it to him he wouldn't even give
the original he was asked by the Smithsonian
to give the original and he refused to do it
because he wants it to be dead he wants to
be dead he wants to place is so persistent
publicly says it's my right on the Creator
and I'm like you know what soon as you
release sent to the rest of the fucking
world you made a committed relationship with
the rest of us and now we're on love with
that thing and I paid you hundreds of
dollars to see your piece of work and now
you're going to fucking take that away from
me you piece of shit I hate Lucas I have
nothing good to say about that

1334
03:49:59,153 --> 03:50:16,889
I hate it because money-grubbing piece of
shit he ruined our childhood and he he he he
came along and he just he started out being
an amazing Visionary and he gave a Star Wars
and I'm grateful that I always will be
grateful for that but then

1335
03:50:16,890 --> 03:51:17,373
but I know there's a despecialized Edition I
know about it I know all about it I know I
studied it I studied it for like a week now
is trying to find it on tauren and download
it and everything and get the do you
socialize I know there's like tons of videos
about the comparisons about which
despecialized Edition yet and there's
there's rumors we were leaking out here but
there's there's rumors actually that that
Disney now that this has got a hold of it
they're going to do the right thing because
there's like an overwhelming dizzy made
despecialized Edition for a special showing
to some like high paying fucked some place
did you see this Disney did it Disney made a
despecialized Edition 2 for a special
showing and not so there's rumors that
they're going to actually you know do it I
tell you what I would pay Disney more than
$100 for a copy of The unmastered Originals
with nothing touching them at all with their
I don't maybe you know some digitization

1336
03:51:17,380 --> 03:51:42,467
there's no theatrical cut of 45 and 6 that's
actually there is a theatrical cut but the
thing is is that there are so many so the
despecialized Edition is one where these
like really intense fans have come together
and they've gotten all the despecialized
editions of everything and then they
remaster them digitally as well top of all
of that but there's no other changes there's
no CGI there's no Edition solo shots first

1337
03:51:41,316 --> 03:52:16,263
who shots first all of that stuff it's all
the original it's got they didn't take
didn't you know what they even took it to
you until Kathy's song out of Return of the
Jedi at the end that with the with the
spaceship flying in the in the in the
defects and everything and I got out I have
angry because I can't even reproduce that
wonderful night of my childhood anymore I'm
renting for no reason but it just it just
pisses me off that somebody would come along
and think that they could do that that's not
a god

1338
03:52:18,860 --> 03:52:34,877
yeah I mean yeah that wasn't a good thing we
got the the thing that made it so amazing is
what they did with it is always looking at a
drawable you know what you would didn't age
well early shity CGI that's when did age
well

1339
03:52:36,320 --> 03:53:00,218
that's what made it so magical with me just
so magical is it it was done with by
puppeteers all his work from all the people
that could think about this think about this
for a second I am just a fan. Can you
imagine being one of the people who created
those original Puppeteer scenes and the
stuff from the original Cantina scene and
all that stuff and all was just thrown out
there just for I can you

1340
03:53:00,309 --> 03:53:34,778
and then all of a sudden you have it
replaced by this horrible horrible CGI those
people who spent their you know there's the
better part of their lives making that or
come to life and then get Luke Lucas comes
along and throws that shit all out because
it's his baby it's not their baby it's his
baby cuz he's a dick is a I can't even talk
about him because he just thinks he can come
is more crucial even though it's not your
fucking creation is something you started
and you got rolling and then all of the
hundreds of people who created that thing
are the people who created you piece of
motherfucking shit

1341
03:53:34,782 --> 03:53:44,502
he came along and he just threw all their
artwork out the window and all of our
memories with it cuz he thinks he can cuz
he's George fucking Lucas Creek

1342
03:53:47,424 --> 03:53:50,704
I can't think about this anymore it's time
for me to go to bed

1343
03:53:53,572 --> 03:54:09,981
it makes me so angry I can't think about
your there's other things to be angry about
that are more important B get her stand
these I bonded with Star Wars as a
twelve-year-old it was probably the most
significant work of art in my entire life

1344
03:54:10,375 --> 03:54:18,681
as a twelve-year-old I related to Luke I
related to his struggles with the force in
getting funding who he was and everything so
for my generation

1345
03:54:18,743 --> 03:54:36,877
that series some people Bond like that with
Harry Potter series some people have bonded
that way with the Percy Jackson series some
people about it that way with you know
whenever there's people Bond differently
with different things are raised as they're
growing up but the reason I get so I ask
myself why am I so angry about this

1346
03:54:36,879 --> 03:54:40,967
the reason I'm so angry is because he's
fucking with my childhood

1347
03:54:40,967 --> 03:54:48,793
and and that's not cool it's not cool Song
of the South yeah yeah yeah

1348
03:54:50,067 --> 03:54:55,240
yeah Song of the South is a scary 12 though

1349
03:54:55,266 --> 03:54:58,087
yeah I know that's

1350
03:54:58,088 --> 03:55:04,528
how rare are rabbits that I mean you know I
understand why some of that stuff needs to
be changed in modernizes because

1351
03:55:04,529 --> 03:55:10,981
In-N-Out I mean there's legitimate reasons
to that kind of thing but there was no
reason for that one

1352
03:55:10,982 --> 03:55:14,911
there was no reason for that one

1353
03:55:17,034 --> 03:55:29,157
I don't even like Star Wars anymore tell the
truth I don't I don't because my my my Star
Wars represented a different set of ethos a
different eat those that I had once upon a
time I don't have that ethics anymore

1354
03:55:29,994 --> 03:55:38,658
but I haven't seen Star Wars at all I don't
disapprove of that at all actually I would
suggest you not watch it

1355
03:55:38,659 --> 03:55:46,429
if anything I suggest you watch Mandalorian
mandalorians a fucking work of art it's
amazing

1356
03:55:46,969 --> 03:56:19,913
and seriously I I cannot recommend Star Wars
anybody you know and I am really really wish
that they had steam rolled over the guy who
was going to do Last Jedi the way he wanted
to tip for a modern generation they they
came in and they ripped his control away and
took it and try to salvage it and it made it
into a Joss Whedon like remake and just Joss
Whedon who made fireflies live in Sweden
anymore he's not just weird and he's become
the guy who saves movies from the box office
bankruptcy you know

1357
03:56:19,917 --> 03:56:22,189
Amanda Martin to think of something about
Mandalorian is

1358
03:56:21,271 --> 03:57:03,165
fluoride is is totally unique it stands
completely on its own it's got this sort of
winter it's got a completely different story
line is God it's got a different set of
ethics and principles and it still has a ton
of nods to the old Star Wars generation so
you know something that might have been like
in one seeing like you know like the the the
the Bounty Droid right you know gets one
scene in in all of Star Wars and all of a
sudden he gets like a full in a fight scene
and so to the people like me that nod to the
former Star Wars generation is really nice
if Jon Favreau his he's a genius man that
guy is a genius

1359
03:57:03,170 --> 03:57:11,104
I mean you know he has done so many amazing
things Fargo how do you say his name

1360
03:57:11,496 --> 03:57:15,535
he sent so many amazing things

1361
03:57:15,796 --> 03:57:22,109
I just watched the making of the movies that
made us and there was a movie that he

1362
03:57:22,679 --> 03:57:27,548
talks about in there I can't remember the
name of it now he actually

1363
03:57:27,957 --> 03:57:35,320
it is one of his is one of his first movies
they had to make which one was it I can't
remember

1364
03:57:36,413 --> 03:57:45,208
this works by the way so there's. Two and
three and four so we're ready for an FS
tomorrow I'm going to say this

1365
03:57:46,953 --> 03:57:49,198
I think you do BJ

1366
03:57:52,559 --> 03:58:01,358
a house is not a good or evil shit music
that's super dangerous

1367
03:58:02,462 --> 03:58:04,751
I guess I waited too long and then

1368
03:58:10,130 --> 03:58:11,678
oh God

1369
03:58:17,172 --> 03:58:28,056
are the production of goods and then
Mandalorian is fucking awesome and the
writing is just amazing it could it's so
good

1370
03:58:28,434 --> 03:58:33,596
the right I have to have good writing I'm
just finicky

1371
03:58:33,992 --> 03:58:40,492
I do have to get ready to die alone as I've
said overwhelmingly many times

1372
03:58:41,619 --> 03:58:43,371
god dammit

1373
03:58:49,216 --> 03:58:54,853
I don't want to admit that get

1374
03:58:55,298 --> 03:58:57,672
how do I remove them

1375
03:59:01,895 --> 03:59:09,215
I can't remember the commands I found I know
they can I think it's on the stage right

1376
03:59:11,388 --> 03:59:13,853
when is it

1377
03:59:18,108 --> 03:59:19,882
remove

1378
03:59:23,893 --> 03:59:26,820
I mean even if it deleted I don't care

1379
03:59:28,958 --> 03:59:33,228
now it's it's stage something

1380
03:59:37,441 --> 03:59:43,755
I don't remember the trance what day did the
Doctor Who

1381
03:59:45,039 --> 03:59:49,409
I haven't seen the new and I could see how
you could get into that though

1382
03:59:49,409 --> 04:00:13,707
damn I I likes. A little bit of Doctor Who I
didn't get really into it but I I totally
get it it in the problem is is like it's
whatever it is that you associated with your
childhood and people start fucking with it
and you can't recall it anymore you can't
pull it up and then you start getting angry
it's like they're just sitting on your
childhood and they are don't care as long as
it doesn't make money

1383
04:00:13,710 --> 04:00:21,478
it's like him damn it how do I

1384
