1
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:53,000
all right this morning I'm going to try as
fast I can't even do a speed install of
icing to my try to get it up in under an
hour is trying hard but if I can get it up
in under an hour an hour and a half I need
to get a test instance of a single up so I
can write some coat against the rest API for
icinga2 and I'm going to jump right into
that and then later on we're going to be
sending a simulated disk disk full messages
from her days to figure out how to speak to
an I sing a system outside of Aries cluster
can't run nice and get into the community as
easily anyway I saw the research I did so
that's what we're going to go do

2
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:59,525
I said Cisco learning because I've never
done it so if anybody wants to help out let
me know

3
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:10,342
is it here really anybody to watch right now

4
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,622
first things first

5
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:22,610
what set out the goals for this little bit
of a learning lab

6
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:30,767
I come understand

7
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,897
like I single

8
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:39,924
is an how it came to be

9
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:45,363
I already know that but I'm going to put
that there

10
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:53,168
provision avian

11
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:58,326
refusing to host huizinga

12
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:12,786
I'm going to need icing and I'll gets
components

13
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:26,639
Olivia. Sir

14
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,520
I saw that thing in the fantasies like
postgres and everything

15
00:02:54,471 --> 00:03:02,155
a working I single at 2 monitoring system

16
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:07,260
set up with all its dependencies

17
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:10,557
on a single server

18
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,098
I see

19
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,385
understand this system

20
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:42,303
and then it says for an icing installation

21
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,699
I saw that I sing a dependency case install
I Singa

22
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:03,992
I figure I single to receive alerts

23
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,389
Oakley

24
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:20,729
we probably do a different lab for icing

25
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:29,691
yeah we probably do a different one 4

26
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:37,428
for setting up alerts sending an alarm as it
going to Ronald how's it going expert G

27
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:54,161
test alert messages

28
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:04,109
what is a singer that start with the first
thing how we so

29
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,801
is icing a monitoring

30
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:26,474
and I single stack all right

31
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:34,560
is coming to an end the latest blog post

32
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:45,263
monitoring basics back to

33
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:05,694
here we go and if we terraformed

34
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:15,864
and yeah I don't have to reform set up
because I don't have a cloud but yeah

35
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:18,512
that would be something to try for sure

36
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:25,492
so what is this thing

37
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:31,280
so just tell me but who knows I want to be
able to set up a monitor and

38
00:06:31,819 --> 00:07:12,084
I need a ride the Monitor and communities so
I'm going to be using mini cube with a VM
driver in order to feel the disc without
blowing them at my work station away if that
which is what would happen if I use a darker
as a driver I'm going to use Uber as a
driver which I got working last night and
I'm going to write the monitor for the full
disco in PVC and I want to have it be able
to send a message to I single which is going
to be running on another vml play on the
same network and I'll probably have to
bridge the networks are to make it happen so
I need to set up a single to do that so I
need a machine on Mean Machine on Mean
Machine For That

39
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,729
cell

40
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:42,636
how to get started getting shower this
weekend so I think it is that monitoring
solution and it was born from nagios it's
been off for a while and caters to
Enterprise but it's in a slack integration
it's how many companies send slack
notifications rather than writing their own
Bots it already has all of that and Elsa has
a dashboard and its own pseudo language

41
00:07:47,100 --> 00:08:12,773
it was your first full stack Monterey
Enterprise solution insulation course for a
Stressless start with the singer your online
name of the first impression we sing at
we're going to go ahead and follow the docks
as best we can all the courts of February on
supposed to monitoring system at the end
you'll be able to monitor your servers and
works in applications I don't have a long
time for this so I'm going to try to finish
this and then an hour an hour and a half to

42
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:17,229
Aditi I don't think it is it is closer to
Nadia's

43
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:38,603
do you want to relearn about Madhuri bases
get from are the senators in general and you
icing a way of monitoring I can just tell
you I think I may have modules that you can
put on systems and you can have a model for
anything and then that model just sends up
you know some of the mothership that's all
it really is

44
00:08:38,605 --> 00:09:00,624
every easy way to start working at least two
gigs Ram two or more cores I sent you was
for the operating system and Apache web
server wow that's that's a lot of
information that's exactly what I needed to
do so let me go ahead and use maygrant to to
provision this since we got bigger it to
work yesterday finally I need to find you a
bunch of image

45
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:08,844
I'm going to get ahead of myself though are
you mean

46
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:21,373
are you started working at least 200 GB of
RAM trim or cars or since I stopped
Bernice's to Apache web server and might as
well as any of us so those are all things
that have to be

47
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:27,912
things that have to be installed yeah but
still

48
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,054
and gangly out for y'all but I'll get it
yeah I know this is the one we have to use

49
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:45,991
alright so let's get it sent his box set up

50
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:54,806
I'm going to step two understand sister
Penzeys original version machine someone
else at 3 already

51
00:09:56,602 --> 00:10:02,027
I need to set up a vagrant job 2

52
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:06,729
pull down at Evian freysinger

53
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:13,247
so I'm going to try this I haven't going to
snow while

54
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:15,837
regrets

55
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:26,061
I got to make sure it gets to the doctor.
The doctor image the diagram which is the
only thing you want to use I did a whole
video on that last night if you want to go
watch a bigger and we finally got it to work

56
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,242
is it dead in the water I don't think it
said we use it at work everyday all the time

57
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:36,620
so I don't think it's dead

58
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:45,317
what were you what were you sitting what
would you think would be a new thing

59
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:55,779
what is a more modern alternative to icing
go I think about Prometheus and that kind of
stuff

60
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:59,384
as if working. Guess is Backward Compatible

61
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:14,413
well not always but yeah in this case it's a

62
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:41,215
I taking you your browser I'm also trying to
read here cuz I'm watching other stuff at
work

63
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:47,450
I had to complete a captcha I don't want to
complete a captcha piece of shit Cloud Fair

64
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,546
I hate fucking hate Carver

65
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:07,214
when I gave him a general the way depending
datadog free this was her phone again yeah
those are things that we do have those in
the Enterprise but we still have a single
left around

66
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:14,889
that's why I don't want to spend a lot of
time on it dog years is the older version

67
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,672
is Narnia still supported imagine it is

68
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:34,270
I thought I didn't like nobody else is
probably I got a lot more usage out there
leftover

69
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:42,019
spiceworks have never heard of datadog I
know it's been off forever I just paid them

70
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:49,540
they've been a mess out here that one he's.
That's that's no

71
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,678
am I checking on RT Pandora observium none
of these or any good

72
00:12:56,678 --> 00:13:03,204
I think I think Nadia's going to be the most
popular it's also the oldest

73
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,405
zabbix I haven't heard of though

74
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:13,580
I understand electricity support as much as
usual as I get notified about coronavirus
isolation without delay

75
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:17,207
I don't have for me feel so sit here at all

76
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:22,810
is Prison Break is it just a coronavirus
check

77
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:28,365
I mean I could have that wrong with

78
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:34,175
Prometheus elasticsearch that,

79
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:50,395
prices of star systems monitoring and a
learning tool kit to do my SoundCloud is
this after 2012 many countries in
organizations without the Prometheus and
retracted lots of times I don't understand
why

80
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:57,603
we might we might have to do it for me if
you sing to

81
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:04,929
I I personally don't necessarily want to
useall the time I just have to support it so

82
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:13,624
never heard of Jack Diamond there's a tons
of stuff

83
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:22,482
so Francis has is the first alternate that
comes to my mind open source has learning
tool kit

84
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:35,655
the price is very active in the community
this is true is now stand alone open source
project which is apparently in the company
Timber sizes and your car for the price of
governance practices join call native

85
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:47,994
after communities place in stores in
Massachusetts and Sarah's data right or
you're free this is like an alternate being
Flex I think it's got more stuff to it

86
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:58,219
I mean teachers most Edition model promise
you all kind of hate it from Carol I'm
serious data or the metrics

87
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:05,842
Pine Bush is exporters race is written in go

88
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,146
this is the one I want to get into

89
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:22,437
Resorts World of a of the America Center is
data machine says you're muttering as well
it's kind of like collecting logs

90
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:30,425
nice is not about logging it's about
monitoring the messages so I don't know

91
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,651
I don't know if your major thing I don't get
well enough of that

92
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:40,459
I'm going to put something like this

93
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,580
I put a warning

94
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:25,588
and this is my situation I have to have the
support this I don't I don't think it's dead
though

95
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:28,908
I mean certainly. Dead in our company

96
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:37,581
you're not on this particular point I don't
think that they're like you know the most
advanced thing and has all

97
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,755
I just busy running basics

98
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:09,725
singers will send you the one with the
ecosystem. That's old when was this song
written 2021

99
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:14,860
I think it's relatively new to this is
interesting

100
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:21,002
I find this fascinating

101
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,342
my guess and I singer

102
00:17:27,395 --> 00:18:11,550
this is 121 I don't have a lot of time to
the time I need to set up no matter what but
I do want to understand it better so I can
make sure condition I think it was the New
World Systems Monterey even though it has
been around for over 10 years a great
features and it's a standalone solution for
systems and every Monday August is a
well-established product an enormous
community supports increase for add-ons for
this product pricing as soon as I was that
is free and open source software own
audience isn't I guess which means it can be
fairly disturbing with the source code and
customers we can meet me at my place only
place that products like I seen you can
start to cost you money is in the support of
development categories like it has a price
tag of 2000 when did they start charge as
they always charge your phone I guess I've
never paid for novios

103
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,096
but that price includes some support if you
need it

104
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:32,333
this makes sense a larger part of vitamins
that so you can decorate the technologies
that only customer software which is
possible and I'll guess I'll take a closer
look if you're looking for a rear bumper for
liability and argues

105
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:40,224
11 is just a solution free where you looking
it has both monitoring and system alert now
get us off his analytical insights

106
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:45,988
add your devicedevice coronavirus Brazos in
Cornelius Naga City tomorrow afternoon
services at Wes's

107
00:18:46,382 --> 00:19:25,344
Nargis features I sing I sing it was
initially arrested May 28th 2009 that's why
I never heard of it and undergone many
updates and upgrades at most functional
missile over the years Bowser's projects
gain massive fan base in Montgomery Fanatics
and it is functionally that you would expect
to find only in an expensive Enterprise
solution I think he uses a similar series of
plugins and add-ons and I guess that's what
I was talking about and that is because I
think it began Life as a broken record for
Nadia's although some would argue that this
thing has become a mature and stable enough
to be on his own a single operates through
several different modules namely a
single-core any I singer

108
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:31,809
I need to go on stage I forgot I need to go
on stage with Discord just give me a second

109
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:46,799
okay so I think operates three different
modules name in a single-core on the icing
user interface

110
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:54,522
user interface is available as a visual
interface and as a command interface

111
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:21,881
I think I managed to retain compatibility
with then I guess in some ways it can even
use the cnrp remote plug an Executor ass and
remote systems Winery tool on all my single
offers all the essential functionality that
moment expecting a scalable feature-rich
monitoring solution and the community offers
a lot of support material information help
you get started for him or any support you
can request a quote for here

112
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:44,447
zabbix vs. nagato is obvious according to
Alternatives that I owe was was Isaiah was
higher in popularity than obvious as the top
alternative to I think a so I'm just trying
to get a lay of the land here what are the
main differences even have to open this when
are graphene is a table

113
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:49,662
before you go God

114
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:59,310
do I get her ego Nadia's versus cacti
comparison somebody in this chat and mention
cacti

115
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:09,339
so much time spent in there yeah most of us
have right I feel like more of you

116
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:16,617
okay so stop Express is not guess what are
the main differences

117
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:22,302
and I guess and I seem to have all of the
same things

118
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:33,084
icmp SNMP deviously Modern Hardware
monitoring Webster laundry actor-director
alerts reporting Graff small are smart
device to the game

119
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:41,970
everything about these solutions that there
is definitely room for customization

pill for small-scale businesses companies
have save money

121
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:50,441
having a free monitoring tools such as I
think is a good way of your small business

122
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:54,448
now I guess it was support as part of the
package

123
00:21:54,449 --> 00:22:15,250
this makes sense if your services pay for
product can give you the support when you
need it can be a valuable so you can't pay
for an enticing I guess actually no download
its wavefunction version August run for 60
days and this is I did not know nobody else
is proprietary I don't know where I miss
that both of these projects give you vision

124
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:44,693
and today's stuff you need I will come down
and went to which of these two pieces of her
fits your better if you had to pick one and
probably nagas 11 just for the fact that is
such a reputation in this tree I've heard so
many great features of the boss connection
support when is proprietary that there is a
lot of looks like about both these products
not going to offer support and maintenance
plan to meet your budget August Licensing
Spokane to be here and I'll fuck that I
thought was pretty good right up so

125
00:22:44,696 --> 00:23:20,640
see what else how do you say sing it to
monitor your services Services entering a
single till that next ocean Bay. Anytime you
find any blogs on digitalocean make sure to
read them because digitalocean pays their
bloggers for their contributions and they
get really Kick-Ass great stuff I cannot
tell you I have been so impressed how to use
a singer to monitor you have a pay
independent blockers for high quality
content

126
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:27,884
they tend to be better than everything else
your servers

127
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:35,464
and services yeah I'm not interested

128
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:46,175
yeah it'll be dealt and that's never going
to be in the colonel it'll be you know that
right

129
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:54,670
they openly stated emphatically rust will
never be in the colonel it will maybe be
supported for drivers

130
00:23:55,018 --> 00:24:02,821
so stop saying it's going to be in the
colonel to lie that's in Spring Boot and
Alternatives not working on that right now

131
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:10,630
Kevin Love workout informations area liver
yesterday

132
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:18,366
terraform we we decided you can't have
terraformed without a cloud and so I got
bigger into work instead

133
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:24,705
Easy Lover and that's why we drink today is
because that's what it's designed to do

134
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:28,826
drivers are not carnal code

135
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:54,067
yeah they're not in their mind probe into
the colonel that that's not Colonel Cody
sorry no but you can't convince me otherwise
you can try drivers do not count let most of
the stuff is is that we use everyday is a
driver I get it it's pretty damn close to
the colonel I definitely calls into the
colonel directly but it is not strictly
speaking it is not Colonel code

136
00:24:54,832 --> 00:25:05,995
a very specific targets protocol find to
change the graphics inside the map to make
the right icons bigger so I had to download
the source and take a seat file

137
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:15,384
did you ever doubt how did you do that when
I get there I think they have a f support
right so I think that was what was going on

138
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,410
all right so it's been and would you like to
share the snow

139
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:29,042
how do you say sing the money or services
are in Oracle 14 and a bun 24 can put on
that's pretty oldest 2014

140
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:33,468
is it 2014 I guess that's kind of cool. Just
me just been around for awhile

141
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:41,689
I mean I don't know if it's the wrong it's
about all the other all right back to what I
was doing I don't want to get too distracted

142
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:49,307
we need to get a ride so we need to go get a
vagrant soon system up and running

143
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:55,639
we need install I'm going to South Central
us on a VM using vagrant

144
00:25:56,144 --> 00:26:00,075
with the other support

145
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,942
and see if any permits you

146
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:17,625
yeah that's another it's another terraform
issues like the one that we had before

147
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:29,701

comment is really stupid

153
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:12,370
I don't want to get sucked into this right
now

154
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:18,191
I just want to say thank you for posting to
suffer

155
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,843
and it came is fine generated

156
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:32,129
I guess somebody wants to see it I'm just
reading this little bit learning
documentation

157
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,367
I started to see Lenox

158
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:48,500
Air France is a homeowner upset that this is
exactly what it is actually not terraform
doing this live bird doing that

159
00:27:52,597 --> 00:28:00,464
and they were fix us known issue that
farmers Hanley volumes from look for

160
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:10,095
Mexican singer of Liberty ISO doesn't change
permissions it's a liver problem

161
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:20,651
I fix this problem with this

162
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:30,069
okay play mind if I work around is security
driver none we did this

163
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:33,574
a system restart we did that very thing

164
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:46,321
double check that driver doesn't run I tried
that and it didn't fix it unfortunately

165
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:52,386
delivered

166
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:59,936
I think we need to actually change the
security driver equals then let me go check
this another project but

167
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,995
when is it Lambert's

168
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:17,450
Kimu

169
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:29,292
week we had to change the the owners of the
group ownership

170
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:45,875
the extra driver's license able as a result
of a screwdriver exactly none is a special
buy screwdriver can be set to that value in
isolation but it cannot appear in a list of
drivers

171
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:51,273
I mean I don't have a problem with it

172
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,925
that that I thought we did that one but just
not at tour list of fixes

173
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:17,620
starts convert G

174
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:40,821
others have reported that

175
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,166
disabling the security was it

176
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:11,912
there's like a plethora of fixes for this

177
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:26,631
plethora would you say you have a plethora

178
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:30,981
when you say you have a plethora

179
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:51,961
I think this is an SE Lennox problem just
might actually pop up now that we're using
Cent OS for hosting because it has selinux
on by default I've heard I have not use it
ever so we're going to go get at

180
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,505
thank you for sending that suffer I'll go
have a look at that

181
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:06,052
appreciate that I do want to get that

182
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:16,922
dashing Ben is there a liver Dash bin I
didn't know there was a liver Dish been

183
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:28,870
I doubt there is none of the liver d think
I'm

184
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:35,726
it is a part of a generation oh

185
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:50,731
I want disable default policy to create

186
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:56,662
what the hell it is very long

187
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,513
I don't know systemctl logging I got to go
look it up

188
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:20,163
I checked the log it would have been a rose

189
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:27,095
status is there an option to check full
system D service on file with you let's go

190
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:39,130
journalctl is something I have never use
it's it's relatively new to the admin tires
just go to Vlog with

191
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:47,674
external seat l s u and I know I got really
old semi skills really dated

192
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:57,541
Journal ctls you Len Birds d

193
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,551
a hostname to make a screwdriver

194
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:24,271
why isn't that one why is it rapping I don't
understand

195
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,482
it should not be rapping and shouldn't

196
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:43,817
bubble bubble bubble

197
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:53,297
nice

198
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:06,825
how far is it to the policy to create
confined guests

199
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:16,769
hope policy create can find guess and
support a configuration security driver at
model is not available

200
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:27,003
who's trying to do that I make sure I didn't
kill my virt-manager

201
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:34,108
the vagrant default

202
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:40,677
Zoe got running

203
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:49,586
nothing like it weren't raining yesterday
socially actually now it's use it later to
Metairie

204
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:58,188
yeah we got we got a lot of stuff from
yesterday that's nice right out the back
that out but I don't see you now

205
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:06,525
I got to learn journalctl I have to do for
that damn it

206
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:24,555
I guess I just do it's like a mandatory
thing I know it is and I just again it's one
of the many things that have to catch up on

207
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:30,227
which you know kind of came about because

208
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:39,439
if add to my list of notes

209
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:50,531
I think of what we're doing we're installing
CV to get back I'll recommend resources for
installing am I single so I can do my
testing for work today

210
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:57,508
so yeah let's go back

211
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:06,115
where to go to

212
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:21,003
trying to decide whether we need to make a
beacon fire or not for this probably do
listen to it I think a bigger and file and
then call down to

213
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:29,566
so just do that I don't remember a bigger I
think it's bigger than it

214
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:48,845
now that's using its getting its give me
this stuff right here because it's running
as a Docker container which is the only way
we can get it to work it's actually pretty
fast to get it work that way and it includes
delivered so far by the fault so I strongly
recommend doing that

215
00:37:53,841 --> 00:38:01,332
figuring files is a big ass any of this
stuff we're going to do

216
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:08,809
I'm going to go here how can link and go
look at my lips

217
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:14,355
I think I think it's generic sent to us but
I don't know

218
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:24,526
Cento S7 what's the most recent version of
sent to us

219
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:28,621
that was over a year ago

220
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:39,203
what's up in the sky actually Cent OS

221
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:47,295
generic centos7 yet let me see 18 days ago
all right we got it

222
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:53,653
all right secrets

223
00:38:56,016 --> 00:39:01,550
Cento S7 I think we need the rest of this

224
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:08,317
we need to vm's which I think we get by
default

225
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:15,197
vagrants to CPU

226
00:39:22,014 --> 00:39:24,802
I don't know how to do this stuff somewhere
look it up real quick

227
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:35,450
customize 2

228
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,417
if I let me go

229
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:50,192
and provided does it have to be by the for
the if you're running liver provider YouTube
to the lines like this

230
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:57,818
as soon as I can. I have to find you have a
lot to receive your new favorite machine
editor file

231
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:00,403
I'm thinking about like this

232
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:09,066
is there is if you when you're slicing a
banger by McPherson file for making a scrape
on his details actual purpose of your family
as described here

233
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:13,466
immigrants remarks

234
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:20,007
so you do have to do it

235
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:24,718
yeah you have to do it by by thing

236
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:39,202
liver fry can make me a provider memories of
used to

237
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:45,766
what were the constraints kicking around two
more cars

238
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,695
ticking around two more cars so that should
work

239
00:40:53,986 --> 00:41:00,642
ruby yeah I know I do like really I wish

240
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:05,993
wish we could use it more but I don't
remember it I don't I do not remember it

241
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:16,638
so let's do that let's do vagrant

242
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,820
up and that should actually pull the boxes
well

243
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:28,736
yay it's working

244
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:38,699
the too early for this probably

245
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:47,783
they just wake everybody up with your whole
family up

246
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,851
I only killed my machine trying to run a
video and a VM at the same time

247
00:41:56,673 --> 00:41:59,618
play some I didn't crash

248
00:42:04,513 --> 00:42:12,357
it's definitely hung that is weird Repose
gray and yes please

249
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:15,115
that is so weird

250
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:36,525
I computer is not have a look at pump
Alyssa's shit voice is really shit lately I
am just going to say it like this it doesn't
draw anything this is happened to just like
every probably every 3 days has happened to
me

251
00:42:37,528 --> 00:42:43,937
and I beat my my workstation to death no
doubt but still

252
00:42:45,117 --> 00:42:51,760
I can't say that we have to reboot machine
is ready

253
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,527
vagrants is ready I just can't see anything

254
00:42:59,636 --> 00:43:03,883
Define I am going to pick you up from
another terminal

255
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,405
I can't even add a new turn on cuz I can't
fucking see anything

256
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:12,981
that's okay she'll right there and then we
go to terminal fuck

257
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:23,347
pastry dough a new window new new window
this is

258
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:30,570
and look it works then what's your full
screen this guy

259
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:36,755
hey I got it back yay God dammit still a
fucked up.

260
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:40,537
Do we know when the salmon don't lie is it

261
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:48,584
I don't know I have been using it look it's
crashed on me at least four times as you
steam

262
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,926
is he doesn't even approve thing

263
00:43:52,234 --> 00:44:03,558
hey by the way sister is it might be I'm
running out I mean there's a bunch of
distros are the standard workstation for
gaming and everything like that so

264
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:06,836
I'm seriously thinking about going back to
Linux Mint though

265
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:18,844
Vince I don't know why I don't want to lose
all my gaming everything too so I promise
I'm not going to do anything to the truth
cuz I want to store my games and stuff but

266
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:24,640
I'll just complain forever right we have our
machine up now so

267
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:29,546
researches going to show us our machine

268
00:44:36,229 --> 00:44:44,612
that was status what does it list and every
go so we have a lot of things that we have
allowed vagrant to fault

269
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:51,464
remember Phil are probably take down for cuz
these things are heavy

270
00:44:52,284 --> 00:44:58,377
let's do that vagrants I want to see verse

271
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:06,521
Holts hello what is it

272
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:14,376
I don't know her ass for real I got to learn
it it halter stop or something

273
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:23,043
I meant all the things ever gave me

274
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:27,268
I know my jarosz shit I will never use it

275
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:38,742
it's the only distro that's bricked my
entire fucking lab I felt ever ever use it
not to mention their commute the people that
run in absolute Crooks

276
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:45,565
corporate perks of the worst kind yeah I
will never touch my girl

277
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:51,066
hey I love you please my job but it's too
bad she bad I feel sorry for you

278
00:45:51,641 --> 00:46:01,208
like people getting caught in using my
drawers are first thing because I'm told you
it's run by corporate Crooks who got a full
marketing system going on

279
00:46:05,737 --> 00:46:24,499
is that why your Papa's going to Papa's to
get somebody suggested last year 2 years ago
and it just worked and it got rid of all the
you if I issue the beginners were having and
that means did not do well and because they
did some cool stuff at the low-level and now
they're just doing too much cool stuff

280
00:46:24,502 --> 00:46:41,835
I don't want to like electrical stuff
they're doing like trying to read right
though fucking desktop and rust how fucking
stupid do you have to be to rewrite
something that already works at supported by
an entire Community for more than a decade
just cuz you want to rewrite it and rust
good luck with that spend all of your

281
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:48,199
all of your money on that what a great
decisions system76 goodbye

282
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:55,257
yeah it's like it sounds like a fun project
just not necessary

283
00:46:55,501 --> 00:47:48,755
whoever is whoever is running the technology
over there doesn't have a fucking clue
forget my system 76 bunch of shit if I just
blew it they don't whoever's going to spend
all the HR money because people are the most
expensive thing on rewriting an entire
fucking desktop that already just works you
only got three or four options out there why
not get behind one of those instead of
rewriting the whole fucking think the
problem with system76 is there starting to
get successful and so they're starting to
not give a shit about their users or they
could do instead keep this from happening
but they fix their fucking another going to
show this is the reason we need to rewrite
it because this is no problem and I can't
read anything at all the menus or fucked up
and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah they
could have contributed to fix this issue but
instead they won't they could have not
gotten rid of my search ability from from
here

284
00:47:48,762 --> 00:48:05,437
without having to click on applications and
had to just work they cannot just stop
fucking around the desktop and listen to the
user that they don't want him anymore
because he's getting big system 76 getting a
big head and they're starting to make a
bunch of stupid ass decisions you don't
believe me ask Line-X does Linus Tech tips

285
00:48:06,146 --> 00:48:13,028
oh that would never happen in Rust yeah

286
00:48:13,249 --> 00:48:15,968
built-in protection

287
00:48:15,968 --> 00:48:24,238
okay it's never a good idea to rewrite an
entire thing just because it has a couple
bucks

288
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:32,269
I do it all the time it's still not a good
idea good for me the X-Men I will never
change you to act like

289
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:37,281
all right so back to something useful

290
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:47,571
unable to watch The Watcher plasma screen TV
Guide

291
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:55,866
keep my screen key doesn't work now are
there we go again

292
00:48:57,546 --> 00:49:07,352
it's let's go alright so we did it ya a team
I wasn't too fast too long much time you got

293
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,219
everything going

294
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,303
pina colada

295
00:49:30,874 --> 00:49:46,769
all right so it's all right to course around
we just did and we we we provisioned with a
couple lines of vagrants so I'm happy

296
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:58,029
okay we need to have from his second Apache
web server am I supposed to be a base so
what I want to know is if they want the
Apache web server to be on its own system

297
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:05,039
I feel like the answer to that is yes

298
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:22,161
I kind of want to make a an ansible roll it
brings up the patchy why do you have to have
a patchy can't we use nginx

299
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:32,053
as his representative patch I'm serving my
schedule a fucking hate my Askew all we need
is postgres and nginx

300
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:37,888
I mean if it can't run on the same system

301
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:50,808
can I want to do this with the with ansible
I know there's an ansible rule for putting
nginx on there

302
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:53,620
yeah

303
00:50:55,915 --> 00:51:15,880
read that either way I said it came in a
razor yeah I think it means a get the
machine running and then put these things on
the machine I think that's what it means or
not Apache is the will gobble up all tickets
around like immediately it's fucking memory
hogeye Minister that for years

304
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:21,515
I'm I'm I don't know if we're going to
figure this out

305
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:31,968
this is really a good opportunity for me to
learn how to use it ansible and like do the
do the provisioning yeah

306
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:38,736
you probably need to include a single.
Confident that you know, yeah I don't know
what's going on and see

307
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:46,420
Mexican sauce thing that used to sing about
just play it again I single

308
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:53,017
is it there is there an as well provider for
Apache web server I bet there is

309
00:51:54,274 --> 00:51:58,701
are using a single 0 10 x but it's a good
too

310
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:03,606
I got using a single though so it's what I
want to make sure we have any dependencies
here

311
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:15,248
yeah I did I read I brought my stress and a
singer in the sunplate I mean and nginx in
someplace else I just don't think it's in
this particular tutorial

312
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:22,301
yeah the comedian thank you for that convey

313
00:52:24,263 --> 00:52:29,950
recommendations Sentosa patchy watch over my
child there to give his recommendations

314
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:37,245
I saw a single web so I think that's it I
saw a single Heaven instead of saying it to

315
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:43,371
I send it to get the director game hey hi

316
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:49,699
so let's go get is there an ansible role to
install

317
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:56,513
I know I'm I've never done it so don't laugh
ansible

318
00:52:57,388 --> 00:53:05,166
install engine it's got to be and an x on
with vagrants

319
00:53:07,843 --> 00:53:14,960
there's a Playbook this place is everything
as well

320
00:53:16,604 --> 00:53:22,606
animal playground Andrea shoes ansible

321
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:29,658
and the reason as well so I just spoke to
her Ash Wednesday services

322
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:37,027
video streaming down with vagrants managex
as long as you so I can figure

323
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:41,427
out of commission is extra figurines

324
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:48,094
I mean let's go read it

325
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:54,091
Hey look it's not even doing my terminal
properly now

326
00:53:55,823 --> 00:54:00,311
hopeless I'm telling you dude pop OS has
gone to shit

327
00:54:05,168 --> 00:54:11,106
a razored edge X let's go to little bit
further

328
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:18,739
30 Vigor environment did it bigger than its
nipple

329
00:54:21,118 --> 00:54:28,601
as you can see in the trees haven't even
make you some blah Lenox of course yes

330
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:34,802
welcome and have a vagrant system
highlighting the vagrants if I was writing
Ruby

331
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:38,049
a material theme why

332
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:46,469
oh my God. Jesus yell provisioner

333
00:54:48,467 --> 00:54:55,310
to have the test, so I can take something
for something for us

334
00:54:55,312 --> 00:54:59,792
when you find a message this one I'll just
make it to the shell script

335
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:05,573
he's a shell provisioner that seems like
cheating

336
00:55:05,573 --> 00:55:10,501
I'm selling it and since I think I'm talking
to it over rest

337
00:55:11,155 --> 00:55:18,210
a divorce in a single yes please that might
be the one

338
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:23,258
how to Shell how to shell script install an
STI Singa

339
00:55:23,295 --> 00:55:26,690
we just had your apps install

340
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:31,659
they gave us of our finding work yes

341
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:51,657
an original Up is on this telecast including
all the warnings and chunky chunky Chompie's
in one who got it to work because he had had
the same problem before are they I don't
know what they are they and got it to work
before confirm the file is correct bigger
notes

342
00:55:51,659 --> 00:56:02,043
so this actually is just a song nginx like
from the command line using the Shell
provisioner which I did not know you could
do Indigent I mean it's cheap and dirty way
to do it when

343
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:04,966
the way to do it when you don't want to fuck
around with

344
00:56:07,442 --> 00:56:12,654
you know I mean that's just like a cheap and
dirty way to do it without without fucking
raw with ansible

345
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:23,438
well I mean it's why he's bigger I have it I
get to sense there's a lot of overlap
between Vega and Turner forum and its
ability to make it install and do shit
that's not designed to do that was one
example

346
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:34,790
set up for forwarding configure Network
440-8280

347
00:56:35,564 --> 00:56:51,953
it means that we can browse to on your way
soon as your server you never forwarded
Portage s a t o c a t a t i n g Nikes with
this change we should be able to launch a
browser and see the engine x with a right
away

348
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,602
Jay Anthony time you change a bigger file

349
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:05,788
and the first machine is already running
you'll need to run a vagrant reload

350
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:11,601
as a thing bigger reloaded the thing I did
not know this

351
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,262
yep vagrants I know I went from being a
hater on it to loving it

352
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:28,832
configure game. For minor shell

353
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,244
I'm going to have to do an apt update I
would think

354
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,419
I don't think

355
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:55,008
yep that way that way that's a config
vagrant config 2

356
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:03,096
do is fig. VM

357
00:58:03,803 --> 00:58:09,094
provision Shall Pass provision. Sh

358
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:26,252
Crystal scripture telling me it's that easy
it's like a Docker file

359
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:28,877
it's like a Docker file

360
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:41,455
I think I can actually just run it I can
take that damn provision she'll path

361
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:48,869
is really it holy cow a super cool

362
00:58:49,728 --> 00:58:54,385
pig perfume for vision

363
00:58:56,379 --> 00:59:00,941
shell pass

364
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:08,178
vision it seems like cheating

365
00:59:13,686 --> 00:59:15,876
I mean

366
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:27,936
provision Ash on

367
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:36,927
I can't touch my update I feel like I'm
running a Docker file for God sake

368
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:42,312
Afghan that's why it stall

369
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:47,090
nginx and wanted posters on there

370
00:59:49,823 --> 00:59:53,739
service engine start no

371
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:58,296
no it's just a c c l

372
00:59:59,248 --> 01:00:06,685
i don't know actually you know the stew
let's see if we can get this work

373
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:13,883
this time actually it's going to start
automatically Anixter Saint Michael

374
01:00:13,883 --> 01:00:20,412
how do you say what is a plus for us install
I think it's

375
01:00:21,228 --> 01:00:24,477
I think it's I want to say

376
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:31,035
happy tea

377
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:43,324
Sommer Ray oh God went the other day be in
pages

378
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:51,663
yep it's very that postgresql well let's try
it

379
01:00:56,909 --> 01:01:04,482
vagrant what did I say I think it's a Reload

380
01:01:07,549 --> 01:01:12,667
at the bottom here vagrants

381
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:17,257

382
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:26,987

384
01:01:37,954 --> 01:01:44,681
wow Let's go over here

385
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:54,112
my route status

386
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:59,721
nginx that doesn't make me happy

387
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:07,166
God damn it I just don't think it ran it

388
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:14,655
by the way my weight machine already
provision run vagrant provision to use the
provision

389
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:22,239
prisoners March run always will still run I
think I missed something here

390
01:02:22,827 --> 01:02:26,994
or make or a Jackson make the changes to
take it back to a ha

391
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:37,378
fragrance risen shit

392
01:02:38,127 --> 01:02:43,257
we talking about oh it's red at it's red hat

393
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:55,266
I feel really stupid in a long time I
provision redhead server

394
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:06,398
since I worked at I am I'm not even kidding
this is the first time I've ever seen a
redhead server in since 2012

395
01:03:06,414 --> 01:03:19,124
it has been 10 years since I've been there I
don't even know you at all

396
01:03:19,718 --> 01:03:22,401
no is a million things wrong here

397
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:32,440
so let's let's see if I can actually do it
for the command line this is probably the
bad day to choose to do this with redhead
but whatever

398
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,362
I need to get my red hat skills back up

399
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:41,128
I do I am I am not my redhead is not any
good

400
01:03:43,523 --> 01:03:51,897
but young shit I haven't done it young man I
haven't had in 20 years

401
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:58,075
yeah I know usually but not always update

402
01:03:59,776 --> 01:04:01,994
sudo yum

403
01:04:02,702 --> 01:04:09,184
all I seem to be working

404
01:04:10,282 --> 01:04:12,203
all right

405
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:29,049
is this okay do you think that's okay no

406
01:04:30,722 --> 01:04:36,088
I want to try I try my provisioning again

407
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:41,080
vagrant

408
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:45,604
start a Skype vagrant provision

409
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:54,087
oh hey look at looks happy Alex happy

410
01:04:54,234 --> 01:05:01,256
it's green that's good right well football
scouts a first person or two

411
01:05:01,742 --> 01:05:06,795
all right that was some serious happiness

412
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:12,232
if he wants to know where the questions
needed what's needed

413
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:22,472
and that's why oh yeah that's why I've
always needed I'm pretty sure it's the only
needed do I need an apt

414
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:25,462
and if it's needed for r.e.m.

415
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:37,176
so that would be a difference between the
two definitely if that's true I feel good I
feel like I feel kind of proud

416
01:05:38,213 --> 01:06:22,193
how safe will to do that in one command I
mean come on this is why I spent three days
busting my head on ki-moon KVM vagrant
terraform ansible and all this shit because
even if your community's person you still
need to bring shit up fast to do testing and
to do things so you still need to be an
infrastructure engineer the reason my job
description says we don't just want devops
Engineers is because they need people that
know how to do this other stuff and it's
been a while since I've done that so I'm
it's good that I'm updating speaking of work
I'm reading our stand-ups which is over
nothing in the stand up

417
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:30,963
if it's deaf people advised up on time all
working hard I am going to try my hardest to
work a regular nine-to-five

418
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:33,367
session

419
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:53,756
so because I just feel like it's a better
thing to do with my work environment because
they work 9 to 5 or 4 or so so I'm actually
going to try really hard to maintain a
traditional work schedule I'm going to try
to drop my bimodal sleep schedule

420
01:06:53,757 --> 01:07:06,150
because it's more important that I'm
available for work that it is that my sleep
work better I could probably still do
bimodal it just means I'll have to go to bed
as soon as I get out of work

421
01:07:08,419 --> 01:07:16,949
so I don't know if you got up you don't know
what I'm talking about and go back and read
my by modal sleep.

422
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:35,544
All right so so so so so so so so I have a
provision thing I'm going to set up walk
around and get a little bit more decaf
coffee and I think I lost another job as
soon as I already so yeah for sure no do a
pincher yeah well

423
01:07:35,754 --> 01:07:37,999
so so yeah

424
01:07:38,000 --> 01:08:09,836
there's one thing that stopped me sleep
exactly one point where the problem with
sleep for me is is having to be at a
consistent time frame schedule that is super
hard for me I don't operate that way and
I've I've I've I've pulled back on the
alcohol alcohol and caffeine or the things
that will fuck your sleep up there more than
anything else that those two things actually
really disrupt your sleep so I was doing
both so I pulled back on the caffeine today.
Must not have went to bed early instead of
playing with her and tell God awful early
hours in the morning

425
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:21,946
but I know we're going to we're going to
find out no promises no promises but you can
let my body do its thing I'll see when I get
back to doing yoga in the morning and that I
miss it a lot actually

426
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:28,522
while there's a big old thread going on
about replacing go that's cool so

427
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:38,933
I mean I'm surprised at how fast it was it
when we definitely got it up we got we got
it we got the new provision do we got to
here

428
01:08:38,935 --> 01:08:41,421
we got to hear

429
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:48,561
in an hour so that's really great that took
us about an hour to do all that so that was
you cuz of vagrant

430
01:08:50,543 --> 01:09:22,207
install a single configure I seen her she
looks okay I'm going to set up make some
coffee come back and we're all ready to go
we're going to do the eye thing is so now if
everything goes well I'll have it done by by
noon I'll have I seen a completely installed
by newest are playing with it for this
afternoon and I need to write a rest API
query to talk to it and I need to figure out
what I want to do that with curl or because
I need to report I may be something in my
running go on and we'll see

431
01:09:23,518 --> 01:09:32,698
nothing for the afternoon so the afternoon
if you want to see me codeine alerts that
are going to send off a single messages

432
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:43,512
that's going to be this afternoon I need to
I need to get Cooper days to go fishing if
we don't have that many Cube nevermind I
forgot

433
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,046
I'm going to take a break

434
01:18:14,685 --> 01:18:20,254
that way when you eat your head gets cold
Amazon

435
01:18:20,753 --> 01:18:25,137
blood leaves your body I guess go to your
stomach

436
01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:33,211
DeKalb most anybody worry

437
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:43,864
all right my God is so good

438
01:18:52,116 --> 01:18:57,441
so good coffee is good when it's asleep
snowing outside

439
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:07,322

slower on Startup but it is so much more
reliable

would be kind of fun to read through some of
these books online together

499
01:27:39,627 --> 01:27:42,061
would it be more valuable

owned

510
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:30,213
if I can be available on Linux that's what I
heard that's what I read yeah

511
01:29:30,304 --> 01:29:34,789
they deliberately sent out Noah next why the
fuck would they do that

512
01:29:35,707 --> 01:29:45,443
stupid that's why they think this could be
safer on Mac and windows not it's not it's
not going to be safer

513
01:29:46,311 --> 01:29:48,194
dim

514
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:55,350
hurry back to what we're doing what what are
we doing we were trying to

515
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:05,282
what what I want to hate if I buy The Humble
stuff in and thenThe Humble stuff in and
then all the sudden doesn't run on Linux a
minute I got to be stuck

516
01:30:05,843 --> 01:30:09,859
but I can barely even read it because I'm
using Linux I'm going to pull my back out

517
01:30:10,483 --> 01:30:14,142
I can do that I guess I have to do that now
so that worried about it

518
01:30:14,349 --> 01:30:19,738
I need to know that because if that's true
I'm going to be like not buying stuff on
humble anymore

519
01:30:20,104 --> 01:30:22,928
ever so

520
01:30:24,647 --> 01:30:29,387
like almost as a matter of principle don't
want to spend a single dime over there
anymore

521
01:30:29,653 --> 01:30:36,556
because of that at such a dumbass decision
maybe because I don't understand it

522
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:49,102
I wasn't I don't I've never bought anything
from her but I don't know how they deliver
the stuff to you the statement that they're
going to make their own launcher makes me
think that they're going to hide their stuff
behind like a Kindle kind of situation

523
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:53,051
that PDF again then a fine

524
01:30:55,532 --> 01:31:04,654
ultimately that's what I want to do I just
want to add into my big PDFs collection and
just call it a day and I want to fuck it up
then yeah I got a USB with PDFs

525
01:31:08,665 --> 01:31:14,418
I said is he library then probably I don't
even know what that is

526
01:31:17,471 --> 01:31:24,117
back to the task at hand we need to install
Tysinger I'm going to follow the directions

527
01:31:26,684 --> 01:31:33,640
what is this I just had to install stuff
postgres what you don't need anymore

528
01:31:34,955 --> 01:31:41,456
I saw a single web I need to install game

529
01:31:43,349 --> 01:31:47,116
guess I was a single download installation
course

530
01:31:49,155 --> 01:31:55,749
well that's what I'm reading I'm reading I
sing as anybody else but then other people
say it's it's not being used that much and
I'm like

531
01:31:55,891 --> 01:32:06,275
I don't know I use it at work that's why I'm
in footing on I would be inclined to use for
me if he has instead but I'm not completely
sure for me this isn't only an caretti SEC

532
01:32:06,407 --> 01:32:10,604
because I haven't I haven't look deeply
enough does anybody know

533
01:32:10,604 --> 01:32:17,644
Prometheus is Prometheus and grafana are
kind of like the modern thing

534
01:32:19,193 --> 01:32:25,313
they still think he's well how's the car
keys for you in a game nice

535
01:32:25,727 --> 01:32:27,520
well

536
01:32:29,328 --> 01:32:36,674
give me the full second reprise water
solution for the installation course for a
stressful start with a single visiting
online demo

537
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:41,869
for first impression of you sing a s I like
to try the demo

538
01:32:42,611 --> 01:32:45,883
all the insulation course below

539
01:32:48,213 --> 01:32:53,471
I can post a thing I thought about that but
I don't know

540
01:32:53,471 --> 01:33:13,967
I look like I'm going to do a VM I'm doing
any VM I'm going to start using ATMs in
general over darker because it's more real
and I've already hit one situation where I
need an actual device I can fill up the snow
disc and and doctor would not have covered
it

541
01:33:13,969 --> 01:33:25,087
so I'm I it's funny because I know the
beginning of the year people are saying why
are you doing all of that in a container you
can eventually needed device then they were
right so

542
01:33:25,089 --> 01:33:30,444
Mercedes New Relic now

543
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:38,890
follow this course to set my very own
supposed to marry system from the any
reminders or new tomorrow and learn about
Monarch basics in

544
01:33:38,891 --> 01:34:14,019
no I didn't say via VIA more Docker I used
to set up I just I have a question,
workspace container which I use a darker
which I still do for Education stuff which
is essentially you know everything you would
know from the command line but it's not but
you need to become a technician operations
person you usually need to be up because
you're you're trying to test the limits of
systems and you're trying to break shit and
you cannot break shit with darker bottom
line I need to write that down and said
create

545
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,241
you cannot

546
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:28,037
break shit with doctor I have come to the
reality

547
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:40,957
that most of the development and operations
testing requires me to stress systems to
their

548
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:45,279
two again

549
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:51,424
better performance and monitor for

550
01:34:53,517 --> 01:35:00,987
capacity situations well

551
01:35:01,575 --> 01:35:03,772
most devil work yeah

552
01:35:04,182 --> 01:35:20,513
well such things are simply unsafe to do
with an emulated Linux system running within
a Docker container

553
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:30,489
this includes development I have four things
that

554
01:35:31,144 --> 01:35:36,464
involve systems

555
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:44,451
at a lower level in the Enterprise
architecture

556
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:55,020
filling a PVC storage class for example

557
01:35:57,623 --> 01:36:07,680
even though containers are fine for most
other

558
01:36:09,415 --> 01:36:16,548
Cloud native applications development ants

559
01:36:17,552 --> 01:36:19,981
hence kind

560
01:36:22,942 --> 01:36:29,919
this means that I have been using minikube
with

561
01:36:31,147 --> 01:36:32,984
the live Birds

562
01:36:33,994 --> 01:36:39,421
a driver and vagrants a lot more lately

563
01:36:40,272 --> 01:36:44,270
as an infrastructure engineer

564
01:36:48,443 --> 01:36:55,937
structure h e r n s r e type person

565
01:36:56,961 --> 01:37:00,402
I like writing code

566
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:09,001
that either blows shit up or prevents it
from being blown up

567
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:15,629
vm's are the only safe playground

568
01:37:16,092 --> 01:37:19,999
for that kind of development

569
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:41,387
shit Domino's down again I got to go check
this

570
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,365
Liam Smith

571
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:18,806
what's the difference between a cloud
instances of Ian or are they wire are they
Barbara Ferrer

572
01:38:19,092 --> 01:38:26,609
Mel let me start that work for Content
working a container for most of

573
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:34,126
dumb after I have to go look at this

574
01:38:35,677 --> 01:38:38,513
it would be an environmental in the cloud

575
01:38:38,567 --> 01:38:46,648
I'm going to say all right I have to read
this this afternoon I have to read this
stuff from work I might be off the screen
for a bit

576
01:40:35,316 --> 01:40:39,487
and some Freedom 87 Mower and dominoes down
all right

577
01:40:48,752 --> 01:40:53,954
yeah B Honeywell

578
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:02,601
learn Basics recommended resources we did
that already

579
01:41:05,127 --> 01:41:12,159
what is this download thing about just
started download what is that about

580
01:41:13,216 --> 01:41:19,903
download icing gun I highly recommend to use
artificial ice packs to install a singer

581
01:41:24,458 --> 01:41:31,816
official single repository provide the most
recent packages for leading operating
systems from a sign of the coming above the
law

582
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:38,530
sent to us well

583
01:41:39,476 --> 01:41:41,607
package Repository

584
01:41:50,356 --> 01:41:56,290
Center West 7 right

585
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:13,251
I got to stay for vpl right by so make sure
you're still a pill release look at that

586
01:42:18,027 --> 01:42:26,007
I said it was 7 a single with two will also
require PHP via the scl depository system
hey we can have the star vagrant

587
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:33,347
we need to start earlier and file provision

588
01:42:37,629 --> 01:42:43,988
and sent his release as CL

589
01:42:45,843 --> 01:42:50,780
okay redhat incompatible

590
01:42:52,196 --> 01:43:00,015
dnf install unless anti-nausea

591
01:43:02,858 --> 01:43:05,040
I guess your manager

592
01:43:14,666 --> 01:43:19,702
install is this it

593
01:43:22,096 --> 01:43:29,652
RPM import I sing a keys

594
01:43:37,058 --> 01:43:42,707
do you know f install

595
01:43:46,648 --> 01:43:51,505
cuz brings back memories as of right eye
pain or being packages

596
01:43:55,419 --> 01:44:02,494
and then you install as a point of their apt
thing alright I'm going to try to

597
01:44:01,316 --> 01:44:05,128
alright I'm going to try to reposition to
see it expert G

598
01:44:11,163 --> 01:44:17,514
her name is a these bills with your not
recommended for Russian use please use the
release packages instead

599
01:44:17,912 --> 01:44:21,876
I did apps that Bill's not interested

600
01:44:23,873 --> 01:44:29,837
I just try to reload

601
01:44:31,522 --> 01:44:39,037
when did the hard way reload provisioned so
redo are provisioning god dammit School

602
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:47,262
waiting for the machine to boot

603
01:44:55,951 --> 01:45:03,841
uh oh is there a Justice how do we have for
stats in

604
01:45:04,879 --> 01:45:08,042
Emily destruction saved as in light reaction

605
01:45:10,819 --> 01:45:17,173
what did I forget to put in at Hawaii on dnf
command not found

606
01:45:17,891 --> 01:45:19,855
what is dnf

607
01:45:28,132 --> 01:45:30,909
I don't know I haven't used our favor
forever

608
01:45:38,552 --> 01:45:43,513
do you know stands for dandified yum

609
01:45:44,537 --> 01:45:57,644
it sits out for a package manager for a
previous relationship is it still updating
remove package in the central us operating
system is a default package manager for 8

610
01:45:57,752 --> 01:46:05,747
the next-generation version of yum and
intend to be replaced with volume and RPMs
systems did not know this

611
01:46:10,305 --> 01:46:15,418
set create Dandy fide

612
01:46:15,696 --> 01:46:19,255
young is new yum

613
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:35,436
I didn't go I don't have any good
recommendations for go unfortunately no is
my best

614
01:46:36,715 --> 01:46:40,482
I guess recommendations right now or just
through the docks

615
01:46:46,463 --> 01:46:49,981
and just Coral definitely needs his manager

616
01:46:55,275 --> 01:46:57,774
what is makes me wonder if

617
01:46:59,454 --> 01:47:06,714
if this is like an option is like either
this oh wait that's if you're on this is up
here on 8th

618
01:47:06,773 --> 01:47:12,325
and not seven so the Danny fight thing is
only 48

619
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:19,558
holy shit okay oh now I know now I know and
I can fix it

620
01:47:20,231 --> 01:47:26,395
vagrant definition don't need that

621
01:47:34,129 --> 01:47:39,008
get ready for a lot of documentation

622
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:44,262
to be wrong

623
01:47:45,714 --> 01:47:50,060
the dnf command

624
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:57,692
is the standard as of Cent OS 8

625
01:47:58,452 --> 01:48:02,916
before that everything is yum

626
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:13,403
all right

627
01:48:14,897 --> 01:48:17,550
see if we can reprovision

628
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:23,808
we actually have to get all this installed
or just run from a script wouldn't that be
glorious

629
01:48:26,021 --> 01:48:33,484
follow the course doesn't seem like there's
a course

630
01:48:37,401 --> 01:48:43,119
I get my p.m. p.m. Rocio, I knowI know

631
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:49,011
no this is his command it's a rerun it with
whatever

632
01:48:50,759 --> 01:48:56,942
is this okay laughing

633
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:01,377
why

634
01:49:18,558 --> 01:49:21,207
I take back everything that is said about my
rent

635
01:49:51,065 --> 01:49:57,821
yay hey look I think it is now installed
officially holy shit that was easy

636
01:49:59,101 --> 01:50:02,093
now you need to install a sink at 2

637
01:50:04,801 --> 01:50:09,773
you need to see me at 2 to collect the data
in your monitor and say cancellations
fractions we just did it

638
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:15,841
and learn how to run and connect it to your
database that's going to do that

639
01:50:26,514 --> 01:50:32,712
this is where the seven step instruction is
selling a single too and is he going to as
soon as I hear from their the operating
system

640
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:37,565
I'm not but okay

641
01:50:53,383 --> 01:51:00,736
all right we're very close to the answer may
be done before noon though probably

642
01:51:01,712 --> 01:51:09,403
I'mma start sending icing a stuff later
today I can't believe how fast the
provisional itself

643
01:51:10,184 --> 01:51:11,656
Paso

644
01:51:15,142 --> 01:51:21,039
get your Craig is it seemed please follow
this is setting up a senior first off yet
and slicing it to did it

645
01:51:25,793 --> 01:51:32,368
Norm pass that okay package distribution
less than one package of pasta raise

646
01:51:32,903 --> 01:51:37,829
I think it was misconstrued we did all this
wait what

647
01:51:39,539 --> 01:51:44,881
we did all this going to need to do some
more condemned that's horrible code

648
01:51:45,703 --> 01:51:49,017
we don't need any of that we don't need any
of that

649
01:51:52,013 --> 01:51:57,629
we did that we did that mean that we can't
find

650
01:51:57,632 --> 01:52:05,481
off and running synthesizer 6 year olds like
that really stood that did it did it did it
did it did it

651
01:52:06,026 --> 01:52:11,725
as long as you can install Cinema
destruction pack murder he did this

652
01:52:14,636 --> 01:52:20,946
do we actually need to do enable I don't
think we need to I think it does this by
default

653
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,287
wait what I seen it too is that not in there

654
01:52:29,944 --> 01:52:35,229
oh well it's not there I ordered

655
01:52:37,018 --> 01:52:44,415
PM install packages I feel instead of you
thanks already

656
01:52:44,527 --> 01:52:50,727
I think it is I think it's there vagrants

657
01:52:51,504 --> 01:52:59,376
SSH it is systems ETL

658
01:52:59,376 --> 01:53:07,220
satisficing guy to well that's not good

659
01:53:09,495 --> 01:53:12,310
and like I got installed

660
01:53:16,064 --> 01:53:21,767
it looks like all the other stuff got
installed but it didn't get installed that's
what I'm going to

661
01:53:23,781 --> 01:53:29,378
hey hi so so so yeah

662
01:53:30,782 --> 01:53:32,567
and I singer

663
01:53:35,097 --> 01:53:39,097
I mean why don't we do the import key first

664
01:53:42,339 --> 01:53:44,191
I don't have to do

665
01:53:47,837 --> 01:53:51,161
I see that I think we can do it in this
order

666
01:53:53,282 --> 01:53:55,913
and then I don't I don't even think we need

667
01:53:58,071 --> 01:54:02,993
I can put this all here

668
01:54:04,358 --> 01:54:06,164
do it yourself screen

669
01:54:06,962 --> 01:54:13,966
result Tim Oakes has a lot more
configurability I'm not a big fan of turning

670
01:54:16,775 --> 01:54:24,489
I'm a big screen fan so at used to be pains
pains used to be a bit and they added that
right

671
01:54:25,326 --> 01:54:29,216
in about that right that is paying support
to screen

672
01:54:29,566 --> 01:54:34,250
haven't I mean me I was supposed to pay like
that that was not supporting screen for
years

673
01:54:35,534 --> 01:54:38,687
but the number of

674
01:54:44,041 --> 01:55:13,876
so this the status line down here is like a
marquee program that runs and it just loves
the content and puts it into their so again
I am a big advocate of not losing your
screen muscle memory because when you're on
a system that doesn't have tea mugs
obviously but and I've configure some of my
L key is control a default for two months
and I've changed all my other keys to match
screen and Mighty Max RC

675
01:55:14,167 --> 01:55:19,516
self yep that's it says Valley question
though

676
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:26,115
like it without no screen exist they don't
even know it exists

677
01:55:26,589 --> 01:55:35,293
came up this awesome thing I like Oh you
mean screen no around since the 70s

678
01:55:35,348 --> 01:55:42,640
screen is almost as old as eunuchs it's one
of the oldest Utilities in the world it
would appreciate some mouse

679
01:55:49,674 --> 01:55:57,396
well that seems to have work good let's do
vagrant

680
01:55:57,551 --> 01:56:04,595
as soon as you get down there stereo system

681
01:56:04,595 --> 01:56:12,198
c channel status I single to say it's on
it's just an active

682
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:17,755
all right so we need to enable it

683
01:56:19,697 --> 01:56:21,742
and started

684
01:56:25,027 --> 01:56:29,994
National trust's I wouldn't hear

685
01:56:36,988 --> 01:57:08,948
yeah I would I would I would do this is not
original I got I got mine from somebody else
and it has all the exit be careful though
because I took over control see my control C
actually creates a new split pain because of
the streaming situation so you might not
wanted over take your country or your ears
you know you doing nothing I did though I
like it you can override it though that's
pretty damn cool and that was screened

686
01:57:09,550 --> 01:57:16,937
since you unable when I really have about
this I can just keep adding this shit to my
script

687
01:57:18,412 --> 01:57:25,957
and I don't have to you know it's going
around

688
01:57:34,956 --> 01:57:37,899
bigger vision

689
01:57:46,129 --> 01:57:48,637
damn it

690
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:56,113
that runs right

691
01:58:07,204 --> 01:58:09,004
I see how this goes

692
01:58:18,683 --> 01:58:21,210
sitting up check plug-ins yay

693
01:58:26,499 --> 01:58:32,684
I think to do huh sacraments

694
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:44,673
bendy printed poses yeah that's who I tried
that yet this I think it doesn't have a good
talk with the Moe's

695
01:58:45,077 --> 01:58:51,580
and I'm acting ignorant Yes actually vagrant
does use key move it uses live dirt

696
01:58:52,792 --> 01:59:01,337
I'm in East Hartford for local Dev but it's
only if you have a cloud surprise surprise
to her phone doesn't work unless you have
the cloud

697
01:59:02,113 --> 01:59:12,007
it's so I don't plan on using terraform
until I actually have a cloud to point it
locally which is trying to be proxmox of
openstack or something

698
01:59:12,295 --> 01:59:35,737
but terraform I mean is he terraform is
because I'm sure you did tell me that many
people of something that I thought I would
try it and it did I did I actually got it to
work but it just it's just the whole point
of it is so that your end up learning
terraformed into deal with that I'm not
talking about a cloud cloud

699
01:59:36,087 --> 01:59:40,271
and I'd like you to start what link did you
just share

700
01:59:45,057 --> 01:59:51,967
going to break into structure I know it
which one you're talking about

701
02:00:04,117 --> 02:00:09,878
I don't see a link you shared Ms Ms MS

702
02:00:12,512 --> 02:00:19,152
Avicii I don't see one is a 8 minutes

703
02:00:19,856 --> 02:00:25,026
are the doctor in pose yeah I tried that one
it doesn't work

704
02:00:25,419 --> 02:00:30,071
I tried that one yeah I should have
mentioned that earlier that one doesn't work

705
02:00:30,297 --> 02:00:34,994
I didn't work for me anyway I just ran it as
was and it didn't work

706
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:42,420
I didn't work yeah I tried it I tried that
like last week last week and like Wednesday

707
02:00:42,421 --> 02:00:56,487
and a text because it didn't work I decided
I was going to try something else I think
that's the one is a chance I do to another
one it was the community's related

708
02:00:56,641 --> 02:00:59,352
the second senior web server

709
02:01:02,081 --> 02:01:06,820
it's not even as my beer different one
actually I probably driving

710
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:13,879
now in this case I I'm I'm fine with the
Baker and stuff I need to learn anyway
normally I would use a darker thing

711
02:01:15,373 --> 02:01:22,876
but ya know I got here we're saying in fact
that many Cube plus that will probably give
me everything I need

712
02:01:22,876 --> 02:01:28,870
Mini Cooper sat I'm actually almost positive
I haven't tried that image now I'm driving
looked at it

713
02:01:29,165 --> 02:01:34,575
I tried one almost exactly like the same day
music was different

714
02:01:35,134 --> 02:01:47,574
yeah I know that's why I'm saying that's why
the other day were okay the one that didn't
work now that I remember the one that didn't
work was the community's one I wonder when I
sing in kubernetes and

715
02:01:48,115 --> 02:01:50,565
that's what didn't work

716
02:01:50,936 --> 02:02:41,534
do to be fair okay I fully remember now to
be fair I did use that docker-compose and
then I tried to use composer the K to
convert it into coronavirus and running
kubernetes but I didn't run Standalone his
back then I was trying to I was trying to
get icing to work and get rid of these which
is stupid idea I think it is not meant
designed to work in kubernetes everybody
says don't do it there's a few people that
did get it to work and I still feel like
there's a there's a need for it but the
overwhelming consensus that I read was his
people think that I think I should be up and
stand alone and support outside of her brand
new so they can monitor communities it's
like the same reason your train your Dino
silver inside kubernetes even though you can
that's what failed that's why it failed so
so to be fair it's probably worth trying
that

717
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,692
as well and that that

718
02:02:41,528 --> 02:03:10,836
not that without encapsulate the way all the
database it up and everything you know it's
part of me that wants to actually understand
I think I can maintain it because we do have
a nice thing as sincere as opposed to just
getting up and running and try to test the
rest API against it and I was doing
development against I think which is the
primary requirement here but that's kind of
secondary unspoken requirement to be able to
step in and support I seen that as well so I
think yeah I think I think that's totally
doable

719
02:03:11,191 --> 02:03:19,349
yep I'm glad you reminded me of that
actually let me let me make sure to copy
link address I'm going to put the a little
note

720
02:03:19,349 --> 02:03:23,136
am I read me about that

721
02:03:30,077 --> 02:03:34,775
yeah game idea

722
02:03:36,957 --> 02:03:38,925
I want that this

723
02:03:48,063 --> 02:03:55,750
this is for how to install and configure

724
02:03:56,258 --> 02:04:00,780
I sing a not just to get

725
02:04:03,104 --> 02:04:10,962
it up so that you can test the rest API

726
02:04:11,451 --> 02:04:13,078
for example

727
02:04:17,415 --> 02:04:22,374
for such things not consider

728
02:04:22,845 --> 02:04:29,080
you sing the docker compose

729
02:04:30,415 --> 02:04:34,315
file in the related section

730
02:04:48,173 --> 02:04:51,080
yep that's good to know though

731
02:04:55,786 --> 02:04:58,365
how's it going malusis

732
02:05:00,597 --> 02:05:07,626
here here I mean yeah my company most of the
time I don't know

733
02:05:08,147 --> 02:05:13,262
I may have met my company may have met this
channel I made a minute and then in the
community

734
02:05:17,003 --> 02:05:21,992
now that that's noted here so if you just
want to get it up and running go look at the
doctor and post well

735
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:28,087
I just put a warning to

736
02:05:32,336 --> 02:05:39,723
how is weather warning when The Temptations

737
02:05:40,532 --> 02:05:45,392
to get I sing out working in kubernetes

738
02:05:45,868 --> 02:05:51,223
it's not supported and

739
02:05:51,271 --> 02:05:55,101
has no precedent

740
02:05:57,171 --> 02:06:02,384
I want to put that out there for people that
was a big rabbit hole

741
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:10,523
you can probably do it I just don't know

742
02:06:10,523 --> 02:06:21,651
a Prometheus runs in the cloud Rider
Prometheus is designed to run in the cloud I
think I think we're going to see Prometheus
take over more and more because of that

743
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,294
but I don't know I don't know much about any
of them

744
02:06:30,195 --> 02:06:35,700
all right so anything new look at my work

745
02:06:39,759 --> 02:06:42,879
alright so we got icing it loaded

746
02:06:48,231 --> 02:06:53,852
wow even has my history how is it keeping
track of my history

747
02:06:54,138 --> 02:06:58,408
fuck a massive amount of the volume or
something

748
02:06:58,408 --> 02:07:02,616
that's amazing that is something that
vagrant does that is not

749
02:07:03,804 --> 02:07:16,381
it doesn't kept it kept my history it kept a
persistent history well it's a VM God damn
it it has a district I keep thinking of you
there's another reason

750
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:22,681
assistant I'm going to actually edit that
that then I was like

751
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:26,959
I was like wait myself still there cuz it's
not a femoral cuz it's a VM.

752
02:07:35,896 --> 02:07:37,384
Oh yeah

753
02:07:38,073 --> 02:07:44,623
vm's are persistent not ephemeral

754
02:07:50,363 --> 02:07:54,575
myself after Sha

755
02:07:56,173 --> 02:08:04,494
see him and wondering why my history and
everything was still there

756
02:08:05,154 --> 02:08:08,221
then I remember

757
02:08:08,755 --> 02:08:14,026
oh yeah Liam's are persistence

758
02:08:16,507 --> 02:08:22,666
this is a reply the ephemeral

759
02:08:27,684 --> 02:08:34,845
container mindset can creep up on you

760
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:42,762
with a surprise like this if you live in
kubernetes

761
02:08:43,823 --> 02:08:47,362
container land all day

762
02:08:52,532 --> 02:08:59,721
recipe for easy to humor I think that's
funny I think it's very damn funny

763
02:09:00,268 --> 02:09:05,349
citizen reminder slices of his source is
difficult to choose so I wear a large
community

764
02:09:05,952 --> 02:09:16,326
I go for free to find it because if it's
going to cause most people are we why do we
have that we have that as well we being the
place of work

765
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,824
but yeah

766
02:09:25,642 --> 02:09:31,205
so

767
02:09:34,138 --> 02:09:41,377
so that's a pie thing is up and it was Adam
before so that's good news

768
02:09:43,098 --> 02:09:46,241
we're already up to the plugins

769
02:09:53,751 --> 02:09:58,460
I mean yeah

770
02:10:01,285 --> 02:10:05,373
what the fuck is the secret to does not know
how to check external services

771
02:10:09,302 --> 02:10:11,766
do we do the one thing two

772
02:10:12,587 --> 02:10:37,286
I guess so I'm slicing it too and we're just
going to take me to set up check plug-ins
without plugging since you didn't know how
to check provides an extensive property is
lichens are required to make the original
example configuration work on the box okie
dokie for your this for your for a
convenience package name from some of the
most popular operating systems

773
02:10:39,121 --> 02:10:43,367
nagios plugins all oh my God

774
02:10:43,864 --> 02:10:51,830
that looks pretty mono monolithic but
whatever we go

775
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:57,230
installation path UPL slides

776
02:10:57,308 --> 02:11:08,317
action if everybody's going to wait as long
as their employees is to use or distribution
package manager I have no wish to make sure
your father just tell them to go look like

777
02:11:08,318 --> 02:11:10,695
on Debian

778
02:11:10,695 --> 02:11:18,769
and another thing to install OK Google
plug-ins all really that's it

779
02:11:18,769 --> 02:11:24,531
well you know what I'm going to do you can
probably guess

780
02:11:30,904 --> 02:11:37,995
all right and I guess plugins all

781
02:11:42,371 --> 02:11:48,840
and then what all right running I sing it to
you let's go back

782
02:11:49,291 --> 02:12:02,664
system D service already know that's working
we did that come and support Falls actions.
Restart that has enabled yet I know we use
that and

783
02:12:01,586 --> 02:12:03,722
we use that and it's script

784
02:12:08,042 --> 02:12:15,219
you just move a lot want you do not want you
seeing it was just a Sunday

785
02:12:17,017 --> 02:12:25,886
SMS is meant for Access Control System along
such as a fine-grained from your system

786
02:12:27,193 --> 02:12:34,706
is it going to provide its own as soon as
policy his passing has for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 in derivatives

787
02:12:34,945 --> 02:12:43,875
because runs on targeted runs a target of
policy which can finds I think it to
including an able to each other's and
running communes

788
02:12:44,851 --> 02:12:50,544
I guess do I need it I wonder if we need it

789
02:12:52,049 --> 02:12:56,928
I had a feeling we do because I think I
think Jesse Lennox comes on here but if all
right

790
02:12:57,597 --> 02:13:00,198
does Cento us

791
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:07,749
this is a new thing I'm going to hit a lot
how's it going, sent to us come with

792
02:13:08,528 --> 02:13:15,040
I thought he was saying the other day and I
think I remember hearing it come with

793
02:13:18,182 --> 02:13:23,487
what is it called secret Lenox what is the
exact name

794
02:13:25,316 --> 02:13:27,379
selinux yeah

795
02:13:32,396 --> 02:13:34,702
it's a nice release officer since 2000

796
02:13:43,304 --> 02:13:45,430
percent of 7

797
02:13:47,006 --> 02:13:51,439
amazing concept security has Lennox as bad
as Castrol

798
02:13:52,044 --> 02:13:56,613
isomers 50 to Summit retarded church or
greed

799
02:13:56,737 --> 02:14:00,989
bring the commands as what user is a Lennox

800
02:14:04,724 --> 02:14:08,955
I don't know if it's actually on here by
default this is the problem

801
02:14:11,224 --> 02:14:19,096
I mean I guess it doesn't matter it doesn't
hurt to have it installed oh my gosh woohoo

802
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:21,470
that's a nice one.

803
02:14:27,407 --> 02:14:34,575
That's funny cuz it is running in docker why
is it running darker though

804
02:14:37,239 --> 02:14:41,651
oh it's running a doctor because vagrant is
docker

805
02:14:41,651 --> 02:14:47,056
M uses a doctor process

806
02:14:47,057 --> 02:14:52,947
that's why it is good to take care of all
the liver to Sakaya configuration problems
if you're having

807
02:14:56,431 --> 02:15:12,468
Oriental Trading see if I can get at work or
I'll be right back

808
02:24:30,681 --> 02:24:34,062
All rights back

809
02:24:42,604 --> 02:24:49,169
you didn't knock out that's that's
interesting it wasn't doing that before they
change

810
02:24:53,802 --> 02:24:56,086
another exit status

811
02:25:00,644 --> 02:25:06,319
I think that's because I put Securus
security Lenox on it now I can't start

812
02:25:08,499 --> 02:25:10,441
I think that's what's happening

813
02:25:17,588 --> 02:25:22,152
a running slender Brothers

814
02:25:23,581 --> 02:25:28,106
Ellipsis sized is that a word

815
02:25:28,801 --> 02:25:34,552
still looks like a word a non-english
speaker put in which would not be the first
time

816
02:25:40,924 --> 02:25:43,064
I feel like it was already there

817
02:25:50,211 --> 02:25:52,739
I didn't see a sensationalist above

818
02:25:55,923 --> 02:26:00,539
yeah I don't think I'm going to Sensations
is required

819
02:26:03,899 --> 02:26:10,507
Christina I need it for vagrant right hey, I
don't need it I was just being honest the
station works

820
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:16,622
but it does make me wonder if it's even here

821
02:26:29,256 --> 02:26:31,815
what is it

822
02:26:37,375 --> 02:26:40,200
a 60 so there is an HD running

823
02:26:41,630 --> 02:26:49,741
and I got I got got up from in a phone

824
02:26:50,981 --> 02:26:58,933
so they apparently puts SSH on there by the
automatically did not know that is something
I learned today

825
02:27:02,009 --> 02:27:08,429
I don't know if they'll steal anything is
required or not I feel like it's not

826
02:27:08,942 --> 02:27:13,397
I don't know if I think the reason for the
failure is because it was already enabled

827
02:27:13,939 --> 02:27:17,024
and I just did reload for vision

828
02:27:26,954 --> 02:27:31,079
I mean I can do it and I can delete the
whole thing I think this because

829
02:27:33,309 --> 02:27:39,727
one of the other steps does it how to start
a Singapore Service Unit not found

830
02:27:40,626 --> 02:27:43,385
Chris has bigger and seems that this music
Medfield

831
02:27:58,989 --> 02:28:01,427
I still says it's raining I understand

832
02:28:18,873 --> 02:28:20,452
understand

833
02:28:25,542 --> 02:28:28,746
I don't think we need to seal Onyx I don't
want to fucking say more

834
02:28:32,277 --> 02:28:38,339
I don't fully understand what what failed
was everything is still running it's like

835
02:28:39,889 --> 02:28:41,088
you know

836
02:28:45,209 --> 02:28:52,828
I mean what actually did fail wonderful
reading without the provision

837
02:28:55,848 --> 02:28:58,692
I think it might be re-running the provision

838
02:29:00,695 --> 02:29:03,870
I see you in a single for that does not
exist

839
02:29:10,961 --> 02:29:17,292
oh why is there a dish for on there anyway

840
02:29:20,206 --> 02:29:27,253
that should have been icing it to the whole
time somehow I change that that was always
in there

841
02:29:28,082 --> 02:29:32,117
that was always an error all right well that
explains a lot

842
02:29:32,452 --> 02:29:51,844
I must have done something with me I wear I
like made it - 4 by putting the arrow keys
down at all I was on a number if you ever
done that so if he I buy the fault if you're
on a number and use a certain combination
it'll actually increase or decrease the
number I think that's what happened I think
that's what happened

843
02:29:52,756 --> 02:29:58,584
that was it that was a stupid mistake but
it's fixed now

844
02:29:59,872 --> 02:30:06,555
yeah let me know that's what I want and
that's what the problem is you control a

845
02:30:08,127 --> 02:30:15,703
yeah hey guys this is exciting Reisinger

846
02:30:16,263 --> 02:30:22,714
thinking provides configuration example
sentence as you let me know okie dokie

847
02:30:24,811 --> 02:30:29,905
it sounds like a damn sure add-ons not
interested

848
02:30:32,549 --> 02:30:36,213
hello there my singing audition vs. package
manager

849
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:51,940
then add on manager I didn't know that was a
thing I got a nice here today and I don't

850
02:30:51,941 --> 02:30:58,461
I've never used that ever I honestly did not
know that was a thing

851
02:31:00,940 --> 02:31:06,167
yum install in my sing I am okay with that
was try that

852
02:31:08,423 --> 02:31:11,108
it's actually working vagrant

853
02:31:11,851 --> 02:31:17,375
I mean this is kind of fun because it's
going to have like everything

854
02:31:18,011 --> 02:31:22,224
I think him a little longer than I wanted I
got till 12 to do this

855
02:31:22,281 --> 02:31:28,265
and then we're going to move on to testing
it by sending message to it

856
02:31:29,484 --> 02:31:36,610
him am I single

857
02:31:36,988 --> 02:31:43,332
sister shaking is on tested amazon.com

858
02:31:45,166 --> 02:31:47,420
I mean

859
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:57,989
Joe is like a a non plug-in that doesn't get
home like a feminine install

860
02:32:02,383 --> 02:32:04,778
that's stupid answersa stupid answer to
Justin Bieber

861
02:32:14,263 --> 02:32:20,613
I'm going to edit a s

862
02:32:23,481 --> 02:32:25,368
nothing is there oh

863
02:32:31,253 --> 02:32:33,087
it look like it's doing it

864
02:32:42,678 --> 02:32:49,623
I mean I did it was worth it though so
whatever I'm not going to do that anyway I
would rather not do that

865
02:32:50,998 --> 02:32:53,429
I sense if I can work I don't care

866
02:32:58,269 --> 02:32:59,928
say yes yes

867
02:33:04,149 --> 02:33:10,884
hey it worked yeah I just need to log into
shell

868
02:33:12,570 --> 02:33:14,237
that looks happy

869
02:33:17,403 --> 02:33:25,328
I don't know if I'm ready to mail thing but
I'll see to all right

870
02:33:25,768 --> 02:33:30,312
and I didn't miss a single dad of a future
with you takes care of exporting

871
02:33:31,732 --> 02:33:35,493
I figured you be ideal and it might as well
as long as you all

872
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:45,560
we need to do it I don't think we all think
our databases actually need one right now it
where do it though stress

873
02:33:52,641 --> 02:33:54,363
statues

874
02:34:06,358 --> 02:34:12,657
asphyx is on there not postgres who is
spelled it right

875
02:34:26,912 --> 02:34:33,889
that would make me think it's not a song
guess where we saw it though

876
02:34:36,761 --> 02:34:38,543
Oscar Cisco

877
02:34:42,996 --> 02:34:44,810
all right arrested

878
02:34:51,397 --> 02:34:58,579
SQL he asked if I was there

879
02:35:05,552 --> 02:35:07,721
Trevor Wallace

880
02:35:17,184 --> 02:35:23,588
I think it's probably a stand-alone thing

881
02:35:31,162 --> 02:35:37,091
Grandpa postgres no it's not there

882
02:35:39,853 --> 02:35:46,540
installing postgres on Centos 7

883
02:35:53,246 --> 02:35:58,746
documents my address

884
02:36:04,792 --> 02:36:11,749
let's just work single Siri PS4 Smith in a
sorcerer or a motherfuking using putty

885
02:36:14,933 --> 02:36:20,945
I am a Starbucks Reserve Bar Express can't
read

886
02:36:22,855 --> 02:36:29,689
twitch which is better for the kind of
screaming I do

887
02:36:31,709 --> 02:36:38,387
I invented the Tipsy to build a community
better and it makes you make more money on
Twitch

888
02:36:38,388 --> 02:36:43,333
YouTube is for videos of sniper streaming
this article that stream and do very well

889
02:36:42,016 --> 02:36:49,653
stream and do very well on YouTube but it's
if they have communities already here trying
to build a community you can't or won't
because he can't find you

890
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:56,517
that's if you can read it all about that all
over if you do a search that's what
everything pretty much says

891
02:37:06,850 --> 02:37:08,746
Henry version this

892
02:37:14,738 --> 02:37:16,295
what the hell

893
02:37:23,267 --> 02:37:28,330
a Grinch rinone provision

894
02:37:31,613 --> 02:37:35,966
and I think it's just a client to I am going
to need the gland to though

895
02:37:37,343 --> 02:37:40,681
yeah I didn't like any of that that was
still kind of should look that up

896
02:37:42,867 --> 02:37:49,371
yeah I swear I saw the maintained postgres
for two years and I'll be home in 20

897
02:37:51,415 --> 02:37:58,429
2006 first came out it was just bad only
been released for like 2 or 3 years

898
02:37:59,268 --> 02:38:07,041
and now I my skills honored I print out all
the poster stocks and really I really love
both of us really knew

899
02:38:19,266 --> 02:38:24,155
yay inactive so

900
02:38:27,734 --> 02:38:31,869
I mean this is his good, I like all the
steps in one place

901
02:38:43,504 --> 02:38:50,074
i k and Randy be

902
02:38:53,582 --> 02:39:00,251
song EIEIO modules I'm going to bet you

903
02:39:00,284 --> 02:39:03,864
there isn't a single idea postgres

904
02:39:06,481 --> 02:39:10,348
hey there hiya

905
02:39:26,789 --> 02:39:32,478
I'm still acting everything

906
02:39:34,282 --> 02:39:37,764
well what do you know there is nothing to do

907
02:39:39,023 --> 02:39:42,914
and that is me guessing

908
02:39:44,591 --> 02:39:50,083
nothing at all damn it well we got to do
some research Sun

909
02:39:50,424 --> 02:39:56,662
I sing a nice Minnesota icing idea packages
here

910
02:40:01,172 --> 02:40:09,043
I single audios for postgres

911
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:18,015
so we can find singer reporting

912
02:40:26,354 --> 02:40:29,011
installation

913
02:40:38,781 --> 02:40:41,500
postgres

914
02:40:47,193 --> 02:40:49,442
oh boy

915
02:40:53,911 --> 02:41:03,077
am I just shipped to David smokes for
calculating the host and service available
today as far as that you are singing it is
interesting

916
02:41:04,261 --> 02:41:09,098
is that the various just dropped this module

917
02:41:09,098 --> 02:41:14,849
isolation just dropped this module to an
ideal report some folder in your single web
path

918
02:41:25,252 --> 02:41:32,182
that doesn't look right I know reports

919
02:41:33,602 --> 02:41:35,926
I saw the idea model for my child

920
02:41:42,911 --> 02:41:45,303
I doesn't look as supported

921
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:52,236
I wish it were at the credit database my
Singa

922
02:41:53,885 --> 02:41:58,847
yeah I guess we're just going to shell
script and I have to put it in at the mall
or something

923
02:41:59,147 --> 02:42:06,171
I don't want to do this but I guess we have
to do this is probably all configured
automatically but I kind of want to get into
the assignment

924
02:42:07,111 --> 02:42:10,417
I was just very smart calculator how to
spell stress

925
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:18,764
are you

926
02:42:28,229 --> 02:42:30,026
I sing a

927
02:42:43,042 --> 02:42:49,002
if you have to run a thing to do it yeah you
can just do the module

928
02:42:52,133 --> 02:42:54,555
after the nice lights are too big

929
02:42:56,490 --> 02:43:04,243
if you can't do it from there's no module to
install nope

930
02:43:05,749 --> 02:43:07,386
no module

931
02:43:09,357 --> 02:43:13,859
all right so we're going to have to replace
those steps

932
02:43:14,968 --> 02:43:20,888
with this and which ones are going to have
to send a base up first and then doing

933
02:43:24,765 --> 02:43:30,521
pricing to Route I did was I single

934
02:43:33,283 --> 02:43:41,205
I never have to do that I slept her is going
to slack a percent

935
02:43:42,086 --> 02:43:48,833
Davis Wells sitting

936
02:43:49,850 --> 02:43:53,071
I single with less grass

937
02:44:16,384 --> 02:44:22,662
the most recent singer finish the tree.

938
02:44:23,212 --> 02:44:26,708
I think I did okay ask you do

939
02:44:40,649 --> 02:44:42,869
no such file

940
02:44:43,888 --> 02:44:51,233
b p g s u l a h r o w how is it going

941
02:45:01,668 --> 02:45:07,546
did you ask you come on baby

942
02:45:08,443 --> 02:45:15,145
that's what we wanted to see all right exit

943
02:45:17,062 --> 02:45:20,303
you go here

944
02:45:39,608 --> 02:45:43,904
and are nice

945
02:45:46,358 --> 02:45:53,662

obviously if I try it again it'll work this
time

959
02:47:41,778 --> 02:47:44,129
I just keep trying until it works

960
02:48:03,638 --> 02:48:11,308
already wait already installed already
installed already installed

961
02:48:13,976 --> 02:48:21,363
I understand I don't feel like

962
02:48:24,204 --> 02:48:31,263
officiated already installed how many Aria
salt why am I getting all these are
installed

963
02:48:31,777 --> 02:48:38,997
job for your service failed because the
first contact with a terror I don't
understand

964
02:48:45,906 --> 02:48:52,674
journalctl that shake see postgres I guess
because it was already there

965
02:48:54,592 --> 02:49:02,382
I'm fine bulshit

966
02:49:13,170 --> 02:49:20,386
what the hell those are postgres database

967
02:49:21,576 --> 02:49:28,917
how the Starbucks Trenta base enter why

I switch from Regular Show Santos stream I'm
going to be doing sentence a lot yeah for
sure

970
02:49:55,897 --> 02:50:06,335
because it's Enterprise I have been doing a
lot of Enterprise Community stuff I run pop
OS so or dead man so you know

971
02:50:13,992 --> 02:50:17,351

surface Chris

975
02:50:50,904 --> 02:50:56,028
Summersville why though

976
02:51:01,166 --> 02:51:06,442
customer service failed I'll just started
failed to start it

977
02:51:09,019 --> 02:51:15,566
why did Fela start 4 cm is it from here to
look at the database logs

978
02:51:16,378 --> 02:51:20,961
it was working before so

979
02:51:22,935 --> 02:51:24,812
I think I just did that today.

980
02:51:34,572 --> 02:51:42,490
I can turn off yeah that's what I just did
but doesn't say why

981
02:51:43,396 --> 02:51:50,003
did you like CS Pedialyte

982
02:51:50,754 --> 02:51:52,746
we're going to need to do

983
02:52:00,985 --> 02:52:05,161
can I spend a long time it's been so long

984
02:52:07,216 --> 02:52:15,037
I am so stuff I need to work with them I
think I think

985
02:52:17,008 --> 02:52:19,639
I think it's snowing the malls are broken

986
02:52:19,915 --> 02:52:25,509
I know I like this method though because
this tells me exactly what architecture
broke it you know

987
02:52:25,813 --> 02:52:30,075
and infostride a directory so is it okay

988
02:52:32,199 --> 02:52:34,865
watch this if I provision is

989
02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:44,569
it was I bet you it'll work there's
something in the module that idea module
that breaks it

990
02:52:47,355 --> 02:52:50,694
and caused a postcard from not being able to
run

991
02:52:52,879 --> 02:53:06,297
that's my theory I really like this
incremental provisioning approach to vagrant
because it's like the incremental you know
debugging of a shell script except for at a
macro level

992
02:53:07,550 --> 02:53:13,384
did you do something yeah I remember where
it is either

993
02:53:15,657 --> 02:53:18,424
and creates a halt

994
02:53:26,265 --> 02:53:31,972
that's actually just read yes

995
02:53:40,070 --> 02:53:42,806
fragrance

996
02:53:52,845 --> 02:53:59,963
I mean I guess it was in the package it was
something else I want to see asking Lennox
package that was doing it

997
02:54:00,397 --> 02:54:06,869
purveyor the port was already taken in and
tried to open up again or something

998
02:54:07,885 --> 02:54:15,270
and something to do I have I've been feeling
had something to do with the provisioning
not resetting everything

999
02:54:16,519 --> 02:54:21,374
but I don't know hey how's it going and it
gets

1000
02:54:24,749 --> 02:54:27,035
download packages

1001
02:54:29,162 --> 02:54:36,467
is it getting all the new stuff is an
absolute fresh GM install so nope same
problem

1002
02:54:37,743 --> 02:54:40,168
cleaning machine folder

1003
02:54:42,463 --> 02:54:48,011
where is a port forward fail

1004
02:54:48,761 --> 02:54:51,523
you did not found

1005
02:54:51,649 --> 02:54:58,453
2022 if you're being forced to learn it yes
I wouldn't learn it by choice unless you're
going to do mobile development

1006
02:55:11,307 --> 02:55:16,370
who makes me wonder I wonder if it has to be
in order

1007
02:55:17,098 --> 02:55:21,159
Miss was the clients that shouldn't make any
difference

1008
02:55:25,102 --> 02:55:35,925
something has stopped working we need to go
back and slowly and figure out what it is to
stop working cuz it was working before I
thank you

1009
02:55:39,761 --> 02:55:47,201
unless you have Resources phone number and
it's not just that it's I mean we will but
it's not just that his other stuff

1010
02:55:48,758 --> 02:55:55,537
so yeah

1011
02:55:58,159 --> 02:56:04,971
I don't even think I made it yeah a trigger
of won't work until that's gone

1012
02:56:06,869 --> 02:56:14,570
which makes me wonder hey Hector I don't
know how it even was able to do it tell you
the truth

1013
02:56:19,946 --> 02:56:25,597
I don't something changed

1014
02:56:26,616 --> 02:56:34,497
so when I turn those two off and see what we
can start it on our own

1015
02:56:35,692 --> 02:56:37,806
vagrant up

1016
02:56:41,245 --> 02:56:47,441
when you get back up and then we'll go check
the first logs and start it individually

1017
02:56:48,021 --> 02:56:49,864
it was working though

1018
02:56:52,206 --> 02:57:02,275
this is the job this is the operation Shadow
fortunately this is like the sis off job do
you have to be able to install the shed and
get it configured and also stripped it and
coat it and stuff

1019
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:09,315
this is operations

1020
02:57:11,916 --> 02:57:15,877
staring at screens scrolling past

1021
02:57:23,174 --> 02:57:27,823
I know there's no gas Wiggins that's weird

1022
02:57:30,586 --> 02:57:38,529
what part of the script that I break I broke
something in here and I do not know what it
is

1023
02:57:41,817 --> 02:57:43,622
I think it

1024
02:57:51,636 --> 02:57:56,169
it's funny because it was before and I just
read provisioning

1025
02:57:56,482 --> 02:57:59,893
it wasn't as broken or some reason

1026
02:57:59,894 --> 02:58:05,164
I'm still blaming I'm going to blame those
those icing ideas for UPS

1027
02:58:05,272 --> 02:58:08,441
I think that they fuck with supposed to go
somehow

1028
02:58:10,909 --> 02:58:18,973
because we had I think it was coming up
before it was due it was fine it didn't
happen until we did the idea who posed for
Stuff

1029
02:58:22,044 --> 02:58:27,902
in fact I wonder if it has to have a
configure database before we install it

1030
02:58:28,326 --> 02:58:37,858
Nadia stuff I mean it does because I've been
at tries to talk to post for us in the
configure stuff even though the step says
that comes after

1031
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:41,960
if

1032
02:58:47,378 --> 02:58:50,392
or at least have something to connect you
now

1033
02:58:57,620 --> 02:59:00,746
so now what

1034
02:59:04,337 --> 02:59:10,509
I mean seashell

1035
02:59:15,019 --> 02:59:22,896
inactive systemctl enable

1036
02:59:25,015 --> 02:59:31,969
Edwards I unfreeze be a delay and we might
have to put it away there

1037
02:59:31,969 --> 02:59:39,905
I meant I bet you either that or I can't
return it like I 14 something for some
reason

1038
02:59:40,736 --> 02:59:46,270
enable now why I never done that

1039
02:59:51,032 --> 02:59:56,454
I wonder is that can afford to be
asynchronous

1040
02:59:56,772 --> 03:00:03,274
oh and Abel starts at so she can buy and did
not know that that's super cool

1041
03:00:05,308 --> 03:00:13,166
loaded there we go

1042
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:23,248

barlog nothing here

1046
03:01:01,223 --> 03:01:06,088
it has to be the only thing that changed was
that module that was the only thing that
changed

1047
03:01:11,042 --> 03:01:12,504
is in Berlin

1048
03:01:14,844 --> 03:01:19,154

what is versing France versus to new could
be then I don't see anything here this is

1050
03:01:33,898 --> 03:01:36,714
srpg astronomist nope

Sherlock destination can't do it it's there
snow postgres running

1054
03:02:32,394 --> 03:02:34,396
and we must be missing something

1055
03:02:39,275 --> 03:02:44,199
astride address for this

1056
03:02:46,293 --> 03:02:48,207
I said they're doing there

1057
03:02:51,463 --> 03:02:59,005
did you ask you out hey.

1058
03:03:02,068 --> 03:03:03,523
Stars

1059
03:03:08,488 --> 03:03:12,229
I mean kind of found them roots

1060
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:19,251
it's the right any logs though no

1061
03:03:23,434 --> 03:03:24,831
well

1062
03:03:26,188 --> 03:03:40,232
I'm going to transmit this is why we use
vagrant I just want everybody who's
questioning why am I using vagrant this is
exactly why do you imagine having to throw
away a system and restart it after ripping
out of thing every time

1063
03:03:40,343 --> 03:03:46,792
can you imagine it can you imagine the
work-related for that it would be insane

1064
03:03:50,863 --> 03:03:53,977
yeah where to do one piece at a time

1065
03:03:54,451 --> 03:04:00,994
something has changed and so this is how we
actually what has changed so

1066
03:04:02,032 --> 03:04:06,457
intercept is already on there that's why I
have to do for reprovision

1067
03:04:15,661 --> 03:04:20,224
I don't think it's going to do it because
the other stuff is already installed

1068
03:04:20,225 --> 03:04:23,908
so destroyed

1069
03:04:29,302 --> 03:04:31,544
destroy

1070
03:04:33,651 --> 03:04:43,158
I just I just have to say how grateful I am
to be able to script this if you if she
couldn't script this oh my God

1071
03:04:42,873 --> 03:04:52,462
it would be a disaster mention having to
like reinstall maschine a fresh install
every time I was doing this it would take me
a week

1072
03:04:53,337 --> 03:05:04,903
because I have to take it down and have to
reinstall with the right stuff in it from
scratch on Hardware it's insane how fast
everything is gotten because of
virtualization

1073
03:05:06,174 --> 03:05:17,323
I mean I can actually isolate the bad line
as soon as I say infrastructure as code I'm
literally managing infrastructure as code by
iterating immiserating over the different
solutions

1074
03:05:20,004 --> 03:05:27,912
we don't need a new TV oh and did you be
certain the enabled postgres system b a
start

1075
03:05:31,659 --> 03:05:39,554
no I'll be really bad I would be really
surprised if that's true

1076
03:05:42,262 --> 03:05:47,184
it was actually starting before that's why
I'm confused

1077
03:05:49,759 --> 03:05:52,410
I mean it was starting

1078
03:06:00,647 --> 03:06:14,513
yeah I have that one I was looking at that
one but we'll go look at it again that one
is the one that has the unit stuff in it but
I don't think I think that extra in this
stuff is only if you need it I can be wrong
now

1079
03:06:14,643 --> 03:06:16,124
so

1080
03:06:21,090 --> 03:06:28,229
systemctl that might describe something else
so I might go check your system C2

1081
03:06:29,762 --> 03:06:35,931
enable that's that's no

1082
03:06:46,651 --> 03:06:52,295
no it's still not working I don't know

1083
03:06:55,302 --> 03:07:01,155
I swear to God it was working I swear to God
we had it working

1084
03:07:29,533 --> 03:07:35,884
I don't know if you know if we need
phosphorus contribute to this says okay we
are missing one thing we're missing

1085
03:07:36,838 --> 03:07:40,202
set up an IP TV

1086
03:07:41,175 --> 03:07:46,281
I don't know why we needed it to be I but
I'm going to do it that's what they said to
do

1087
03:07:48,370 --> 03:07:51,091
it doesn't make sense of it or need it

1088
03:07:53,446 --> 03:07:59,002
are they want you to run that can I see I
see

1089
03:07:59,002 --> 03:08:05,391
they want us to run that yeah yeah yeah okay
that's what you're saying I'm sorry

1090
03:08:07,697 --> 03:08:09,711
that's very odd

1091
03:08:24,444 --> 03:08:27,246
initializing database

1092
03:08:28,778 --> 03:08:34,855
so they actually wanted you to have a
database you shouldn't have to do that

1093
03:08:35,233 --> 03:08:42,392
no I do not think that is required

1094
03:08:42,803 --> 03:08:53,004
yeah but if you know maybe maybe they're
module but again I didn't load their module
I got rid of it right so

1095
03:08:55,071 --> 03:09:02,057
hey Mom puss Chris I mean why would you have
to build a database before your navel here
but it works

1096
03:09:02,881 --> 03:09:10,798
I stay up with you anymore that's just now
watch it work only shit

1097
03:09:11,084 --> 03:09:17,209
it works so I don't question I just do what
works

1098
03:09:17,210 --> 03:09:23,253
well we got the bottom of that one that's
good I learn a lot

1099
03:09:23,969 --> 03:09:30,821
provision I turn this to fall back on

1100
03:09:42,746 --> 03:09:48,364
and Studio

1101
03:10:02,598 --> 03:10:09,314
yeah I don't know that's weird it works
don't question it it's like

1102
03:10:11,235 --> 03:10:17,608
bring it I'll see if this is enough

1103
03:10:18,118 --> 03:10:22,593
not to destroy it all again it should be

1104
03:10:26,134 --> 03:10:29,183
I supposed to be the reprovision but we'll
see

1105
03:10:35,327 --> 03:10:39,354
hey Claus

1106
03:10:43,498 --> 03:10:49,243
sort of Happy it's sort of Happy

1107
03:10:52,882 --> 03:10:58,721
cross your fingers 00

1108
03:10:59,233 --> 03:11:03,354
my fans coming on my only fan

1109
03:11:08,066 --> 03:11:13,935
it's so interesting what vagrant burning
stuff with vigor

1110
03:11:14,679 --> 03:11:20,161
damn it now I sing is mad

1111
03:11:20,879 --> 03:11:23,936
all right but but I haven't

1112
03:11:27,055 --> 03:11:34,588
plus dresses up worried about me SSH no a
word that it's worth

1113
03:11:36,432 --> 03:11:38,282
it's working

1114
03:11:43,810 --> 03:11:47,521
sorry if that's too bad I couldn't resist

1115
03:11:51,663 --> 03:11:56,215
it did mostly work it most of her cuz I

1116
03:12:03,317 --> 03:12:10,387
give me the status statues systemctl status

1117
03:12:17,832 --> 03:12:25,240
first currency post grass SQ it's activate
running yay

1118
03:12:28,465 --> 03:12:35,322
I think it is that's very possible

1119
03:12:35,586 --> 03:12:41,052
it is very very possible actually we can
check that

1120
03:12:41,327 --> 03:12:47,904
yes we have ways of checking so we can check
I sing a song to

1121
03:12:47,905 --> 03:12:52,059
which is active so

1122
03:12:57,399 --> 03:13:04,475
I mean it's up why was it unhappy ask me
that again

1123
03:13:04,918 --> 03:13:06,862
I don't even remember

1124
03:13:10,524 --> 03:13:15,246
I have your back it up till like 5

1125
03:13:20,499 --> 03:13:27,989
show up no that's too easy I just way too
easy Catherine Jose again

1126
03:13:28,059 --> 03:13:31,951
hey there we go at work see

1127
03:13:31,951 --> 03:13:36,231
see all right

1128
03:13:37,988 --> 03:13:41,449
hurry someone save it while it's all working

1129
03:13:45,155 --> 03:13:51,689
it's all the modules okay we did that we did
that

1130
03:13:53,931 --> 03:13:58,208
I know it wasn't for scratchy right but it
still works

1131
03:13:59,878 --> 03:14:04,250
CV resume look look

1132
03:14:06,396 --> 03:14:08,885
our script continues to grow

1133
03:14:19,236 --> 03:14:25,403
all right still seems to have worked

1134
03:14:36,714 --> 03:14:43,516
next one create that single database oh I
know it totally is

1135
03:14:44,410 --> 03:14:57,473
yep absolutely is and I single an ansible
think so after this after the script gets
done then I'll put in an ansible and then
I'll tie vagrant to dance ansible which

1136
03:14:58,057 --> 03:15:01,488
what should my child be to dependencies but
whatever

1137
03:15:09,880 --> 03:15:12,990
phone cannot change direction to Home
vagrant

1138
03:15:16,518 --> 03:15:22,233
okay I don't care their work

1139
03:15:32,913 --> 03:15:40,847
this is a nice going we're going to go back
we have like 2 tutorials going on now save
us or save us

1140
03:15:42,303 --> 03:15:49,462
I don't think I need this one I think he's
having either there

1141
03:15:50,450 --> 03:15:54,002
locate your pghboe in a configuration file

1142
03:15:56,123 --> 03:16:01,459
and additional user with md5 as of indicated

1143
03:16:05,206 --> 03:16:08,150
I said some pretty hairy insulation steps

1144
03:16:12,189 --> 03:16:13,630
play singer

1145
03:16:22,241 --> 03:16:31,096
tattoo the good thing I know VI right God
what if I only knew Emax right now

1146
03:16:31,339 --> 03:16:36,678
My Life Would Suck permission denied.

1147
03:16:38,428 --> 03:16:44,689
Bite me pseudo call Cece

1148
03:16:48,460 --> 03:16:54,821
oh did you see the kill I actually want a
video about how to activate them yeah we
took me awhile but

1149
03:16:57,796 --> 03:17:01,726
is install instructions of Soul 1990s

1150
03:17:02,329 --> 03:17:05,827
imagine just knowing that hoe I know

1151
03:17:06,534 --> 03:17:18,579
I didn't they did they being my workplace
and so now I'm forced to talk to it even
though I don't not sure I would do for me to
screw phone at today

1152
03:17:18,950 --> 03:17:31,385
as my main thing if I had to pick but but
they have I single leftover and it's a core
thing until after they're not talking to it
and understand it it's I think it's out
there are a lot of single in audiosurf out
there

1153
03:17:31,386 --> 03:17:36,222
so so what do we put in here

1154
03:17:36,776 --> 03:17:44,438
I'll go see you soon so I can system she's
out restart postgres now in front of these
lines in there

1155
03:17:44,448 --> 03:17:52,233
yeah alright what if we just counted them
onto the end of it I think that's what we
can do

1156
03:18:06,274 --> 03:18:11,669
going to have to use my cutting his buffer

1157
03:18:19,573 --> 03:18:26,599
huzzah huzzah huzzah restart

1158
03:18:28,019 --> 03:18:35,526
Sirius system this is like this is the job
people

1159
03:18:35,527 --> 03:18:38,493
walking around with stuff like this

1160
03:18:43,720 --> 03:18:50,590
that seems to have worked I think that's the
Kennedy for provision change

1161
03:18:54,450 --> 03:19:01,491
pseudo I can't

1162
03:19:03,015 --> 03:19:04,656
no I go

1163
03:19:08,422 --> 03:19:13,619
Echo to the eom all of this shit

1164
03:19:15,286 --> 03:19:20,140
nope 2

1165
03:19:22,250 --> 03:19:23,453
that

1166
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:35,343
I can be sure what's a latest version

1167
03:19:39,509 --> 03:19:42,039
cuz it's running on the system

1168
03:19:46,080 --> 03:19:50,907
eventually need to go in and icing a thing I
am

1169
03:19:51,601 --> 03:19:54,767
this is actually running on the machine so

1170
03:19:56,494 --> 03:19:59,604
it gets it gets copied over apparently

1171
03:20:14,132 --> 03:20:28,590
it's my first time using a single yep I'm
just saw him for the first time getting used
to it I have to write some monitoring
software that works with it at work so I
need to learn it real quick really quickly
just in time learning people

1172
03:20:28,635 --> 03:20:35,004
just-in-time learning if learn something
like everyday in like an hour or two if you
can't you just job is not for you

1173
03:20:35,067 --> 03:20:39,506
if you don't want to do that if you're
unwilling to do that

1174
03:20:42,326 --> 03:20:48,966
you like it we probably could have written
this are I just realized

1175
03:20:55,866 --> 03:21:02,288
I just realized we can probably do the
restart after this

1176
03:21:07,068 --> 03:21:08,871
I don't care

1177
03:21:16,542 --> 03:21:18,623
I need to write

1178
03:21:18,623 --> 03:21:26,203
an application that calls a rest API to send
a check to it if you have any information
about that I would appreciate it

1179
03:21:29,976 --> 03:21:46,644
I'm from Cooper Nettie's I need to check on
a filled storage class that's backing PBC
specifically for Domino and then tell I sing
about it so we can notify us

1180
03:21:48,597 --> 03:21:54,994
because you don't have me this everything
else doing it I mean we could do it for me
this but

1181
03:21:57,495 --> 03:21:59,658
back 3 yd

1182
03:22:01,186 --> 03:22:08,666
about an hour I'm exaggerating it took me a
while I've been working on this since 9 my
you know

1183
03:22:09,376 --> 03:22:18,025
you going to be able to learn pretty complex
talking about a day and you have to
constantly be learning new things and I'm
learning that I've fallen behind on a bunch
of stuff already

1184
03:22:18,025 --> 03:22:24,711
so that's kind of the it's kind of the thing

1185
03:22:25,140 --> 03:23:21,932
I know I mean the specifics aside the job is
constantly refreshing your knowledge of
whatever is immediately necessary I
installed and deployed postgres at 8 p.m. to
handle the data store with terabytes of
information for 52,000 machines for out of
compliance and I have no fucking idea how to
do Post rest today I did that in 2006 so the
point is you're constantly cycling your
knowledge you're always cycling your
knowledge and you know I did not get us a
long time ago I mean there's always
something is coming to the Forefront that
you have to relearn a remember and so having
I like a really amazing no taking strategy
and and being you want me to sing with
hacking right in being able to to learn
quickly and to refresh your brain cuz your
memory is not going to be able to remember
everything like me

1186
03:23:21,940 --> 03:23:29,633
the concept stay the same there'splay the
saying there's monitoring there's databases
that kind of thing I just got comfortable
yeah

1187
03:23:29,862 --> 03:24:15,909
yeah and I I hate losing this time but but
it's a part of the job I mean you can't you
can't work with technology until you
understand it and if you try you're going to
end up being in more trouble and I probably
spent too much time researching Tech but I
have to because I don't feel comfortable in
a breaking a thing nothing to you need to be
able to run your own lab and this is my
opinion there's a lot of people who do not
agree with me that tennis us agree with me
and I are just wrong and respect him as it
energy or he's one of our streamers over
here had underscore tennis and to do the
minimum and not do any of this and that's
fine too I know I'm not that person vasotec
is basically service waiting for external

1188
03:24:16,814 --> 03:24:21,202
input while not excluding active check
possibility yeah

1189
03:24:22,819 --> 03:24:33,321
that's the thing I was afraid of because I I
mean if it says anything like doggy to see
if they can write a monitor for it right
well what is it that's that's kind of pull
Monitor and

1190
03:24:33,497 --> 03:24:38,214
I'm going to have to write a check that I
can talk to I'm going to push the
notification

1191
03:24:38,263 --> 03:24:45,468
and I don't I don't remember Nadia's having
push methodology

1192
03:24:45,468 --> 03:25:11,332
it was more about you write a check and then
it would go out and do the thing is that
more of a pole do with the Demi check yeah
that's what I was afraid of because it is
more of a whole system in a push right about
that and basically saying do the minimum and
it shows and I will give you the fun stuff
basically you with the extra mile you could
do the fun stuff and sulli

1193
03:25:11,334 --> 03:25:12,715
yeah

1194
03:25:12,730 --> 03:25:20,825
and that's that's what I get for a
contractor you don't get to do the fun stuff
anyway because the full-time people get all
the fun stuff

1195
03:25:20,827 --> 03:25:37,627
so you better make sure that you have
another source of fun in your life like
livestream because they're not going to give
you the fun stuff you're just a lowly
contractor doesn't matter at this is
something I learned in my I'm totally okay
with it so anyway

1196
03:25:37,629 --> 03:25:42,142
have a great day miss versus you to import
the audio database schema to find command

1197
03:25:44,831 --> 03:25:51,357
yeah it's always a price to be a contractor
there's there's supposed to take us to being
a contractor right

1198
03:25:51,358 --> 03:25:56,141
and there's lots and lots of benefits to it

1199
03:25:56,141 --> 03:26:12,940
it has given take it's like should you be a
contractor or not there's a whole
conversation that we should probably do a a
Sunday call-in talk day on that just thought
it should be a contractor or not what the
contractor life vs. Contractor life they're
very different jobs

1200
03:26:12,941 --> 03:26:16,792
yeah so

1201
03:26:18,199 --> 03:26:26,418
you're thinking about it as being a
contractor I've noticed is that even if my
immediate so there's a kind of their kind of
the Dilemma

1202
03:26:28,140 --> 03:26:36,285
as a contractor they deliberately are not
going to give you the stuff that will avenge
your career and be fun to do

1203
03:26:36,287 --> 03:26:44,455
it doesn't mean they're being mean they just
like to keep that work for their full-time
staff and that's totally understandable I
would do the same thing

1204
03:26:44,456 --> 03:27:41,254
but that means that if you want to stay
current and the ironic thing is to sit as a
contractor the reason you're a contractor is
because you can pop around in your being
expected to know the latest and greatest
thing so you can work on any engagement
anytime so teksystems can place me with
another company and it's up to you to keep
up-to-date even if the Contracting the
company that account for what you're working
doesn't give a shit about you and they maybe
there's some I remember having some
contractors when I was a Nike that they sat
in my cubicle a program that just sucked all
my data out of me they had no idea how to do
shit it couldn't do anything and I resent it
actually talked to my manager I said this
contractor is actually costing us money
because I'm spending all my time training
them they're pretty much an intern I said I
don't know how much money you're paying this
person but you need to stop and so

1205
03:27:41,261 --> 03:28:03,359
as a contractor it's your job to not get in
the way first of all and that means a lot of
times during your ass to do or suggesting
proposing things in and having them okay if
for you because you need to be different I
I've learned this the hard way you need to
be different to the people that are
employing you at the account they are the
bosses they're the ones and you don't resent
them for doing the fun stuff that's their
job you were there to help them that is your
job

1206
03:28:01,856 --> 03:28:51,001
that is your job and if they don't give you
the fun stuff you still have to learn the
fun stuff you have to learn it somehow and
guess what the reason that that is the stuff
that you have to do you somehow on your own
time or you have to be able to rationalize a
certain amount of time doing that on the
clock because you can't be a decent contract
with that doing it if you spend all of your
time on the clock charging the customer for
learning is something that you should
already know or something that might be
crossing over like this contractor that talk
to me it's one thing to spend a lot of time
learning on your own and then getting up to
speed so you can help the company in the
contract that's one thing it's another thing
to sap the time of the people for whom
you're trying to help that's not okay it's
never okay and you keep doing that you get
fired

1207
03:28:51,319 --> 03:29:00,813
I know because we had a contractor fired for
that very reason they have no business being
there probably getting double we are
probably paying him double or triple my
salary

1208
03:29:01,451 --> 03:29:06,262
hi I know this is my first time

1209
03:29:06,811 --> 03:29:39,908
is my first time a first-year being a
contractor or coming up on I'm coming up on
a Fleer I really like it but I just trying
to tell you don't feel guilty spending time
keeping up to date on things because your
contracting company that hires that are
Contracting firm doesn't care about you as a
company they don't care about you and their
people are going to put their full-time
people above you which means you've got to
enter if you work for a Nexus to do
something like that they have a meeting
every week and they provide tons of
resources and training and stuff like that
so you can keep up-to-date

1210
03:29:40,490 --> 03:29:46,133
the nearest ramen ya yeah yeah

1211
03:29:50,134 --> 03:30:07,747
I know right I don't want to give you the
fun projects that will get you a job next or
leave they because they give those to their
full-time people so I'm just telling the new
Dynamic of Contracting and you I love you
too since you can give $0.25 if you want

1212
03:30:08,404 --> 03:30:13,805
is this yeah he was having freedom

1213
03:30:15,934 --> 03:30:27,084
oh God yeah as much anyway they do have some
but not as much as my wife's a genius

1214
03:30:27,106 --> 03:30:34,281
she is have I tried startups yeah I run to
start straight years

1215
03:30:34,948 --> 03:30:39,917
the person you're a business person or you
have a partner as a business person

1216
03:30:41,520 --> 03:30:45,614
yeah don't do it I don't do a startup

1217
03:30:45,615 --> 03:31:02,212
not by yourself anyway I did was a bad idea
I loved it is one of my greatest
accomplishments the greatest times but I
would never recommend etemad again
especially in America where you have no
safety net for 8 years I had no insurance

1218
03:31:02,213 --> 03:31:11,666
contractors are not paid more no God no
contractors the company that contracting
company is paid more

1219
03:31:12,120 --> 03:31:17,339
the number I read over and over again is 60%

1220
03:31:17,437 --> 03:31:29,897
if you take what you make as a contractor
and you add on 60% that's the money that
you're making out there in industry

1221
03:31:29,942 --> 03:31:36,268
cuz like if you were going to be hired full
time if you want to accept a full-time
position

1222
03:31:36,268 --> 03:31:49,898
that's how much overhead they have to pay to
have you be there I believe that and most
companies don't give a shit most most big
companies the money issue is not an issue
until it becomes an issue and then they
start chopping people high

1223
03:31:49,901 --> 03:31:56,443
I yes okay let's go for a walk

1224
03:31:56,443 --> 03:32:04,149
I'm going for a walk I'll be back I don't
know when though

1225
03:32:38,049 --> 03:32:40,976
I'll see you in a bit

1226
04:03:16,133 --> 04:03:18,997
haven't going to stop the stream I'm sorry

1227
04:03:22,552 --> 04:03:28,073
having some lunch I'll be right back as soon
as I should have killed it when I went out
for a walk

1228
04:03:28,427 --> 04:03:34,632
I know I'm here but I think I'm going to go
ahead and take a break and restart the
stream to that
