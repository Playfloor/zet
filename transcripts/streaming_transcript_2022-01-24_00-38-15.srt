1
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:18,461
all right I'm doing a lot of writing and
planning

2
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:27,938
how about 4 a.m. 1 to 4 tonight how about
things that again in my head on this

3
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:35,915
has to be talking through it while I do it
but had the goal for the evening is

4
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:43,508
how to plan a substantial part of the Boost
outline which sham

5
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:55,441
you know it's is what we doing in May so
that's what the countdown timer is about we
learn days until we start the new say I was
asleep I had to

6
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:03,055
I had a pretty vivid dream about

7
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:07,903
the way to have to do this this going to be
easiest

8
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,802
and premier league is going to be moving
away from

9
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:19,910
Docker for the Boost in 2022 so I need to
rework the counter base than then

10
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,984
the first week of the booths will be

11
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:30,407
how many cops like when I get to Lenox and
Cody M boost as opposed to being a boost

12
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:38,008
we can always call it back in beginner boost
but that sounds kind of weird

13
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,883
I'm in infrastructure engineering

14
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:53,826
this is where we can cover some of the some
of the more Google things to learn

15
00:03:54,907 --> 00:04:21,922
when's the rain going to start with
virtualbox it because we're two boxes in
central driver for both minikube and for
vagrant later and then we do containers in
communities we can we learn about the
technology in the same order that it evolved
so if we had his regular servers and then we
had virtualization and then after that we
had it containerization cell

16
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:41,988
another thing to is that if someone decides
I want to go little bit further with Lennox
stuff they want to they want to learn how to
create this partitions and they want to run
Arch and do the install excetera they can do
that with her 2 bucks I cannot do that with
make you let me sorry yeah well with Dr any
of those options so

17
00:04:40,605 --> 00:05:00,806
so so we're back to Virtual machines I was
expecting this but I've been really
influence recently by the work I'm doing
with Patron and I realized that Rachel is
nation is the most important technology any
any technologist is going to learn who wants
to be able to try different things

18
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:11,869
so what does it what does it look like well
let's take a look

19
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:22,128
when it's over to box that looks like I
still have a bunch of ignorant boxes running

20
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:37,050
I'm going to go ahead and test this a little
bit I want to check and see if

21
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:44,717
if you can create a virtual at a volume
without doing the estimate the other stuff

22
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:52,106
and the first thing when do the Arizona on
it I could go back to my other lab

23
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,256
and I need to make or destroy these

24
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,219
how do I get rid of that

25
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:25,487
you're the reason for using a VM is because
we can do snapshots and by default virtual
those machines are State full. A femoral a
vagrant records fantastic

26
00:06:29,809 --> 00:07:14,943
not today I'll be doing that for work today

27
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,161
yep right now I'm planning for the next 3
hours and be planning beginner boost stuff

28
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:36,590
and when I start work sometimes around 9 at
9:10 today I will be doing that yes I'll be
installing kubernetes from scratch on a
system that has an external volume for NFL

29
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,163
that is what we will do

30
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:50,648
I am trying to see if I can do a video about

31
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:55,225
this I don't think I'm going to be able to

32
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:08,512
virtualbox yeah here's a lot on that

33
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:18,803
I'm also considering migrating all of my
stuff into a single lab Repository

34
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:26,950
because I have stuff that goes back and
forth between the different labs

35
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,564
hey Tonya

36
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:44,118
got that going to do that right now I'm
going to migrate all of my lab content into
a single repo called lab

37
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:12,658
yeah we discussed at some point I'm going to
be kind of focused

38
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,395
so

39
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:06,571
recommend a 71 system programming I made a
video series about it

40
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:25,044
again my opinion is somebody who wants to
get into programming as if it should be
somebody who wants to understand the
terminal lots of people disagree if some
people think you should learn typescript in
JavaScript and you can go for that right

41
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:32,943
mr. Yeah too much sun dinner is crap

42
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,478
yeah people can use if I don't

43
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,751
set a tent lab

44
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,655
yip yip yip yip

45
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:54,443
the camera

46
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:12,783
all right I think of that got that

47
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,811
are there key

48
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:02,348
alright so here we go we have me I'm going
to read this out loud while I'm riding it

49
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:09,788
is it going to cuz we're going to cover get
home pretty early on

50
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:17,540
in the Boost we always do get him just like
one of the things that cover the first week

51
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:21,995
because it's the place to put all your notes

52
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:28,749
and but that also means we'll be creating
other repos in there eventually as well

53
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:33,067
the first one of the most important

54
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:42,781
Maine CDC important Rivas every text should
have on get him

55
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:51,909
and I mean get him so I'm going to put in a
related set here

56
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:44,007
no I don't need to sleep I already did I
slept like four hours

57
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:54,037
American missions here we go

58
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:05,333
LG Branch image images of different so

59
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:43,129
good night everybody here that if you're
just up for then I'm going to see you do you
like to visit

60
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,412
Suzette about.

61
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:54,928
About how to use. Or to use the dog may be
right about that in a second

62
00:26:55,004 --> 00:27:02,402
so if you have his username user one you
should have.

63
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:11,212
Is that collab and I believe a CV

64
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:21,736
you know you can put your CV

65
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:28,717
underneath your your own but I I kind of
think having it separately is is valuable

66
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:38,323
I just do because then you can Nike track
all your changes to it without having to be
a mess

67
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,720
I don't have that currently in something I
need to reorganize

68
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:57,826
Especial repo

69
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:10,703
hey ironically this is

70
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:16,608
your website for you and this is

71
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:24,170
your your personal site uh-huh

72
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:31,905
they're totally different

73
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:36,622
2222

74
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,987
all right

75
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,362
do do do do do

76
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,074
what's this one

77
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,431
it can kind of do it the same

78
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:54,062
I got repo

79
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:47,588
hookshot here at the whole thing I tend to
do that

80
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,837
I knew that too

81
00:36:56,106 --> 00:37:02,722
exit group I didn't realize that for that
particular thing

82
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,097
oh God yeah

83
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,934
how's it going doctor professor

84
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:10,673
a pop in the VR have fun with that

85
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,185
soundtrack

86
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:14,666
heard you got one let me know I like this
one though

87
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,168
Dark Knight Trilogy Ultimate cut

88
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,992
ya look at that

89
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,139
on specific topic

90
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:22,278
yep Paschal candle shop

91
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:09,432
all right Sia so

92
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,301
there how are you I get cold

93
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:13,354
tell her bash no I did a little bit on the
Boost

94
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:21,313
KB on the bus there is also a book

95
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:31,754
and I'm going to be doing a lot of passion
in the boosters for this week in 2022

96
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:38,888
this is a free book you can get as well that
teaches bat bash stuff

97
00:46:22,764 --> 00:46:25,921
2 2 2 2 2 2 2

98
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,113
I foresee no we're not going to we canceled
it

99
00:47:02,244 --> 00:47:05,110
I mean it's a good book you can go do it but
I don't have time

100
00:47:06,254 --> 00:47:12,326
I got to cover more important stuff when it
comes to our containers and less communities

101
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:27,336
infrastructure engineering I mean a focus on
that we will do see we're going to learn see
when we code when I'm going to code in C
either in a structure engineering or any
containers Sarah are here I'm going to do a
little bit of it

102
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:31,689
they're not going to be going to be doing
see here as a rule

103
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:37,517
because if it's not anything that isn't
going to

104
00:47:38,643 --> 00:47:44,807
people need to learn to see it yeah she's
one of those things where if you want to
layer it on later you know

105
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:46,735
yeah

106
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:53,988
anything that's not going to immediately get
you closer to a job as a cloud native
infrastructure engineer

107
00:47:54,116 --> 00:48:22,611
is that's the priority so honest enough to
score if we were to do an evaluation of any
particular topic and if the score is higher
than its Amore essential thing for you to
learn to get a job as a condiment Junior
it's always going to fill it's going to fit
in and see a certain amount of C is in Port
for understanding but it's much more
important that you understand estrace and
system calls which RC but you have to
understand what they are and and it's way
more important week of those things

108
00:48:23,888 --> 00:48:56,939
yeah I'm learning how to use make a compiled
software that that is a big part of
infrastructure engineering so we're going to
be learning how to compile C code but
necessary to write it because that is a
truly essential skill if you're going to
install the systems and applications you
need to know how to compile it and generate
it and you know Jen to and that kind of
thing so this is a pretty pretty pretty
contrast from how I did it before but I
think it's important because you only have a
year there's just too much stuff to cut her

109
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:26,862
call generation programmers. Macias true if

110
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:58,743
how's it going mad

111
00:54:36,245 --> 00:54:44,080
all right I think it probably needs a date
to do scmg stuff

112
00:56:37,373 --> 00:56:38,595
tots

113
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:49,790
how do I say yes

114
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:22,444
booty Maxx Bash

115
00:58:38,877 --> 00:58:39,929
okay

116
00:58:45,295 --> 00:58:49,832
yeah it was a great great language to learn
to code in I think

117
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:53,683
I really like that for even for beginners

118
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:39,812
what's up sis calls Daniel Webster

119
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,962
I hate those things man

120
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,471
there I saw

121
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:42,311
I'm going to stop putting tags on their
completely

122
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,724
all right

123
01:04:43,694 --> 01:04:49,822
I made a video about that let me know though
oh my God

124
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:53,611
that's so ugly

125
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:06,415
I don't work right now I'll be back in a few
minutes

126
01:10:47,474 --> 01:10:49,282
dum dum dum

127
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:27,758
yes sir make your mother cry

128
01:12:32,827 --> 01:12:38,251
Ida main thing I want to get out here
actually I can probably find a firefly
soundtrack let's go find it

129
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,971
oh my God I just have a soundtrack

130
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:02,633
there we go

131
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:29,347
I saw you with the NFL thing over and that's
good

132
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:48,985
I mean I like about the idea of having a
single lab like this is it you can go look
at somebody else's lab and see everything
that they've explored you know if it doesn't
fall under its own project

133
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,757
2 2 2 2 2 2

134
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:43,223
I'm going to buy the rest of my stuff over
here

135
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:58,058
we have God so many things gah

136
01:15:00,267 --> 01:15:06,291
delete lab nfhs

137
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:10,563
vagrant

138
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:23,701
are you so status add and access

139
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:31,155
the push

140
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:50,109
