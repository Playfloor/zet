1
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:08,980
and we go so hopefully that made it in time

2
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:33,254
alright so let's do this

3
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:37,114
let's do this let's do this

4
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:47,152
you the whole starting stream think you
might listen to just give you about five
minutes to start I know some people who want
to really cover the stuff so I don't want to

5
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:55,456
I don't I don't want to do it like too fast
and when I can move the time so we just I'll
give you guys 5 minutes I'm going to go make
some coffee I'll be right back

6
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:04,830
Bogdan

7
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:25,804
oh and lots of stuff we got raided I didn't
do a lot of streaming it was just a dream
but it's funny cuz I mentioned you I was
thinking you and we got like 3,000 people
rated as yesterday from learn of Leon doing
amazing things he's doing amazing things out
there

8
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:47,525
hey how's it going to be seen in a little
bit this is going to be a fast stream I'm
thinking maybe now or to the goal here is
all ice cream all the time I drink 24 7 no
ice creams I tell people about are the ones
on Saturday though because that's on the
counter

9
00:01:47,869 --> 00:02:32,803
I just got to be rated nice all right so to
any of our beginners are out there right now
and wondering what's going on here like
why's this guy screaming ice cream all day
everyday like whenever I can I don't know
I've got my work up right here this is
called a cold learning and it's kind of a
co-worker streaming literally being paid for
this time so when I get to and I'm going to
be answering a lot of questions you can read
about this different kind of mode in my in
my about section but the point is is that
I'm doing work and I can I call Atco working
right so so you can come watch if you have a
little questions maybe the check can help
you answer the questions but if I don't
respond please don't be offended I have to
get work done so it's just an opportunity to
kind of over the shoulder and can I watch
the work I'm doing

10
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,324
formatting disc oh my God

11
00:02:37,406 --> 00:03:07,754
love your trophy to buy tabs nice again I'm
going to make coffee be back in five minutes
when we come back if you want to follow
along and you don't know what to do when
you're a beginner in the first two things
you need to do is you need to install
virtualbox on your machine whenever whenever
you have need to get Versa box installed in
the second thing you need to do is install
vagrant and if you don't know how to do
those two things you can look at that you're
doing a liver but so far besides the lab

12
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,399
I can change my mind about vagrant vs.
terraform

13
00:03:12,400 --> 00:04:13,084
yeah it was you if you get it did you get a
good laugh up there and then I can go look
at it I'll do that instead of using vagrant
maybe I don't know though I mean the biggest
the biggest of pill I have freezing vagrant
oh that's great thank you for saying so not
a lot of people are fond of ignorant I was
like cursing it I actually wrote a huge
scathing review sheet with vagrant when I
first did it I really hate it I hate it how
old it is excetera in its quirks and I just
found out that you have to update a box you
have to hit you can't to the cloud you can
we update box into the cloud you can't
update sets of boxes to the cloud which is
really lame is if I want to share something
with somebody I want to share a
configuration that has multiple boxes in it
and I just found out yesterday I could have
been missing something or so. You know any
different than a time there was a real
disappointment to the whole van Bakery cloud
sharing idea the idea of being able to share
my favorite configuration so I'm just going
to stick with you soon and I'll give you
posted that because I'm provisioning 3 and
provisioning 3 virtual machines at the same
time using vagrant

14
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:18,625
and in order to share those with somebody
else have to share his three separate boxes

15
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:35,182
but everybody is it is quite slow oh hell
yeah it's very slow but again the reason I'm
going to stick with a coronavirus boxes
because it's the default sad because you
can't use of energy to figure out if
experimental mode works for district for for
making vines

16
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:39,952
did you find that out yet according to the
documentation I read

17
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:47,591
from any proportion was talking about this
and we know you were telling me the colon
disc

18
00:04:48,097 --> 00:05:17,428
yeah that you can't you can't Persian discs
unless you have live unless you have her box
I read those words I don't know if it's true
or not I read the words that you can't use
the hyper awesome you know disc provisioning
roll with without otherwise have to do that
big long convoluted shit is very specific
hey how's it going mashina macchina

19
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,380
that's why I wasn't trying for a positioning

20
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:33,074
oh I see so you skipped it because you
didn't want to have to use virtualbox with
that suturing terraform with liver which
makes it faster because liver is faster and
then you're doing your own volume to set up
Solitaire for me to ansible

21
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:48,342
yeah if you can if you get like an organized
laugh about that working and want to walk me
through that at some point that would be
fucking amazing hey Jordan welcome some
beginner videos beginner boost

22
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:57,571
now just keep in mind that the Boost that I
did in 2021 we use Docker and 2022 we're
going to let use virtualbox

23
00:05:57,572 --> 00:06:28,123
so just know that's different yesterday was
nuts at a feeling it's it's a foreboding I
think it's going to get busier and hear
people and we're going to figure that out
all my regulars are going to be annoyed
because I'm not going to be able to have a
hug and kiss if you're do you know this I
talked to everybody all the time I have a
very very very interactive chatting as soon
as my check gets out of control or I can't
communicate with my regulars I'm going to be
sad I'm going to have to figure out what to
do with that how's it going Mitch macchina

24
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:37,467
Frank how you doing do the page my Converse
at each full stack with a teamwork task like
a real world

25
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:42,596
and I can pay to get a job that's cool I've
heard of it have you played around with that

26
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:56,411
super cool on that bring it up bring up on
Sunday again Frank if you remember if you
put that many could you put it up bring it
Sunday or put in the am a channel in Discord
so we don't lose it

27
00:06:56,412 --> 00:07:56,943
any other great I'd like to talk about any
kind of I'd like to review new resources for
learning anytime that's kind of a Saturday
Sundays for thing it's so yeah I'm very open
to the possibility of Swiss chard turned
from an ansible LBG because obviously those
are more mainstream tools as their knowledge
in beginning would not would be more
relevant Negron is not so relevant today
it's at it's fine but it's just not as
modern Soul Eater from and asked if it would
be a much better use of your time if we can
make that work an ant but has to be very
seamless I don't want it to be let me come
out meet we did this whole entire thing and
at the end of the day I like Fifty lines of
vagrant that we're going to go get some
coffee so I'm going to walk away from now
and I will start very soon give you I'll
give you all a chance to come on in here if
you want to see how to 1 start up a virtual
startup kubernetes in a virtual machine in a
three birthstone

28
00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:51,504
jeans on credit he's in automatically
configure that get them started and Nick
that's what that happens automatically and
then we're going to break it I might
actually break in a Mini Cooper I haven't
decided if I'm going he's bigger than me to
Que Viet and what we're going to do is we're
going to overburden a note with tons of like
fake jobs and and then we're going to take
that no down in a way that has it push those
jobs over to the other node so that it was
nobody nobody detects any loss of of work
happening and that is that is the girl has a
whole point of kubernetes and I feel feel
like this is it I need to do this actually
I'm looking at it right now that is this
over burn is God's is 6900 restart said it
needed it we need to do this in there is
probably like 300 jobs running on it so I
need to do this task I just I've only done
it once in development and I I want to make
sure they do it right I know it's a pretty
simple task that I still want to do it first
on my own

29
00:08:51,514 --> 00:09:20,592
on my on my own system so I can get a handle
for it and not blow up the world in
production because I'd have to I have to do
this in production is pretty is really right
thing with kubernetes as you know what no
matter how bad things get they really don't
get a no pointer. He's just kind of keep you
available even if if stuff goes bad in and
that that's one of these things is there a
story all right. I forgot about it I got to
go back and review all my notes on it

30
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,815
ya aren't so at least let melet me slip away
45 minutes

31
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:13,661
remind me to write

32
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:24,769
got him I got to remember to do this got to
turn track to off again so this is Christmas
videos going to give

33
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:31,997
can you get muted but it'll just be the
first part I don't get Mewtwo not the whole
thing

34
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:36,452
there's a persistent process like you
control summer clothes go crazy

35
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,343
interesting not sure what that means

36
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:58,252
accurate and he's supposed to be scheduled
for capacity

37
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:06,075
I'm passing small available capacity on a
nobody fault is an issue because no simply
run quite a few system damage

38
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,239
cardio rest in peace unless resources side
for these Damon's

39
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:18,539
I'll just have names compete for resources
lead to restore starvation of a note as
actually problem we have right now actually
this is really good

40
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,886
and yes but you wouldn't give exposed to
Future named

41
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:36,802
I know the cable that helps us recovery
resources interesting okay this is
interesting all right

42
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:43,172
Alabama looking for this are CPUs not
alligator Mall

43
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:50,688
condemned as I get added to the list of
things I have to learn yeah

44
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,098
is it a bit Mo end

45
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,494
all right so again we are we are gathered
here today

46
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,980
to break shit and try to turn it off

47
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,894
so we're going to refer somebody to get
Renown cluster

48
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:48,006
uncontrolled playing coz when control plane
node into worker notes and I have a bigger
for sending the stuff I'm not sure we need
to go through that the energy of doing that
list actually try it with mini Q I feel like
make you would be a better use of this if
you have many things to pick from this point
is because your first time you can pick you
can do mini Cube which is what can raise
that I always tell you to do you can do kind
which does simulated containers inside of a
doctor or a simulated work or you can do
regular in which is a real version Moschino

49
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:51,920
so one of the things

50
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:04,523
as I go through our plan so but first you
need to set up a text with customers on
machines are going to make you all right so
we can do that first that might take a while
that depends on on stuff

51
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:09,990
on stuff and then what

52
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:19,871
so what's say say tasks the first task is

53
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:25,952
to drain now create

54
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,424
a

55
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:35,677
create as a fair number of

56
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,636
running

57
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:47,510
I see I guess you could do it kind of
diverse career fair

58
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:52,814
number of running containers

59
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:02,635
I have a lot of pods in Denver of and pods
on a node

60
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:07,805
on both nodes

61
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:17,302
worker nodes I'm doing because it's the name

62
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:24,189
and pies can be from

63
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:30,144
anything that creates I can be from any kind
of resource

64
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:38,397
kind of curious resource then Step 2

65
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,168
drain drain them

66
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:50,074
I almost want to give away what to do
because if I say drain and that gives away
what it is right

67
00:18:53,672 --> 00:19:01,598
clear the clear clear out one of the nodes

68
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,978
from all

69
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:12,548
running pods such that taking

70
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:21,505
and taking it offline even if it

71
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,665
or power off I won't harm

72
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:33,424
anything that was running

73
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:37,546
and that's why we're doing this

74
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:50,310
now people should be making their
applications in in an ephemeral way unless
they're doing a statefulset and is
statefulset I kind of wonder about estate
for said

75
00:19:53,979 --> 00:20:01,822
I just stopped it is only shit I'm going to
make me watch it right now aren't you

76
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,140
is Rancho just like going to take over for
dr.

77
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:27,560
Shit I think Rancho de steps a darker to
step out there it is

78
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:33,109
Rancher is Atlantic City

79
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,943
I want to see it I want to see it work

80
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:59,120
you got me you got me interested I got to
look at this right now because we weren't
doing the ends right

81
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,326
communities in container management desktop

82
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:15,225
astronomer using a mini Q micro Kate's now
that's about dinner 1300s

83
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,727
in a container in a movie

84
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:28,601
I just have rescued a container measuring on
your desktop you could use a recirculating
you want to run you can build push pull in
and rig taking her to the community

85
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:37,917
container image Evil 2 can run Charisma give
me without the user registry I think kind
kind of it does that

86
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:52,127
fuckfuck fuck yeah

87
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:59,148
is getting rid of it or if I can return this
is awesome

88
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:02,631
this is really awesome we need to do a full
thing on this

89
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:11,044
yeah I am I actually use this instead of
instead of dr.

90
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:19,336
Yeah this is this is really cool do doctor
is going to be hating it

91
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:22,382
I haven't used it before

92
00:22:25,954 --> 00:22:36,959
does it the question is is will it work with
a VPN on Cisco anyconnect I have to try this
while I still have Cisco anyconnect on my
Windows machine

93
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:55,925
because the only reason I use Docker desktop
and I have to stop by my Windows machine is
because of Any connects Cisco VPN the new
cell does not work with Cisco anyconnect VPN
Docker desktop does because it's something
about the network Bridges works and so I'm
going to be cancer type things with him

94
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,826
did you really

95
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:18,860
if if if we install this is this person was
it free I'm sorry this is like really
important for vector company right now is
making a huge evaluation about how to
replace Target. And if this turns out to be
trying to get it to the right people
immediately so this is very relevant for
work and I'm kind of cold working right now

96
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:57,664
we're about to drop a ton of cash I think I
don't know I don't know for sure I'm just
conjecture in here but we're about to their
disgusting it all the subscription rates are
going to have to pay for everybody you need
to talk or just a I don't think of any
alternate and they're doing all kinds of
crazy shit like building Docker build you
know jump boxes and shit like that rather
than just letting people you sent me on
their desktop in there yeah so they're
enduring evaluation what about what to
replace it with and if there's actually a
legit if there's actually a legit thing that
gives them kubernetes in addition to doctor
Mini Cooper Mini Cooper with the slip board
on a Mac will work I mean it was a mini BBQ
with whatever

97
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:03,291
I would not use the movie setup actually
it's These doctor command

98
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:09,338
oh can hear you just and have the doctor
come on your right the Rachel that's right I
forgot

99
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,728
paradoxical life

100
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:19,649
is is some is there an independent project
from the community it must be

101
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:21,339
yeah

102
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:31,028
nurse until I really have to learn this
because we have a ton of users that are that
are back with their hands in the air like
this they have no idea what to do

103
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:35,962
so I'm really whoever told us about this I'm
happy to make a tangent real quick

104
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:44,326
cousin rccl a control Canario who has
exactly what we want

105
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:49,827
maybe if you happy if you weren't already

106
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:55,730
yeah golden projects

107
00:24:56,351 --> 00:25:02,214
the thing is so great about this is it comes
to kubernetes so

108
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:09,898
you know it's kubernetes and it's darker as
long as it doesn't over-complicate shit or
machine learning people

109
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:21,668
will get frustrated to be like oh I don't
want other communities I just want my
bottles are running my images on dr. Give me
my doctor back if if if we if we you know if
we confuse them too much

110
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,768
I don't know

111
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,962
I don't I don't know

112
00:25:30,962 --> 00:26:10,308
I hit the first thing I get that first thing
I have to explain him is like where your
doctor went to have to take all the work
clothes this is what I want actually want to
do a case study on this I want to do a case
they want to say okay here's is common
darker things that you did and hears it,
doctor things you can do now using ratchet
system and God knows I love Rancher I think
Rancho is a company and is an organization
and is in Project is fucking amazing I'm not
a fan of of you know Debbie 30s for four
communities administration because he's not
real but that's a different issue I'm really
important and personal Rancher thing it is
right

113
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:17,840
Ranchos de slack issues getting assumed I'm
guessing it's patchy yep

114
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:24,738
Apache cuz Apaches would businesses like oh
my God this is so awesome at one point oh
one point I was just released

115
00:26:23,408 --> 00:26:28,539
one point I was just released an hour ago
fuck what the fuck

116
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:35,836
how did you find out about the so fast it's
only been out for a fucking our oh my God
the miracle of the internet

117
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,121
the miracle of the internet

118
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:49,597
shit this is crazy I have to go I have to go
tell everybody about this right now

119
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:57,977
I have to tell my team about it right now
because and sentiments on it have you

120
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:00,820
it's amazing Porsche

121
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:09,628
dr. S e family front your desk can be run
with with with ranch dressing out of the box

122
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:21,089
I have to tell my team like now it back I'm
going to go to hashtag General channel to an
oz

123
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:29,989
as a person or company do nails Lockport a
bug to we stream live 1 hour ago

124
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,419
yeah

125
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:42,389
I know if you get the inside scoop that's
right you have a lot of internal demand you
to play right cuz that's why you did your
own thing instead of like doing vanilla Cube
ATM

126
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:52,294
I'm super excited by this and I love Rancho
so much more than redhead so

127
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:58,578
kind of laminate start that project I got to
start watching that

128
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:04,813
all activity every months ago it randomly
browsing get head

129
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,652
yeah yeah yeah it's actually not. Just up
anywhere right at stalker personal and
Doctor Enterprise

130
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,423
Admiral a proposal 21

131
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:29,419
the department has gone yeah I'm sorry I
moved all of the labs are still there
they're just all in a lab repo now so you
can wait you'll have to follow the one repo
you don't have to kind of track them all if
you just you can follow everything in one
little Networks

132
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:34,423
you know the agenda for today there's no
agenda I'm at work

133
00:28:34,424 --> 00:29:32,673
so the main the main agenda today that I
came in here cuz it's a receipt so when I
strain during the day it's cuz I'm working
and so I usually is Coco working some kind
of all over the place if I change what I'm
doing or usually change the topic down here
but I started the day I started the day
doing kubernetes no safety offline cuz I
have to drain some communities notice so we
will be doing that don't worry about that we
will be doing that but but we just took a
big rabbit hole because an hour ago 1 hour
ago probably the most significant release in
the container world for end-users was was
made by the ranch or company and the more
I'm reading about this summer I'm being
blown away by this this is fucking huge news
you need to take your CTO is aside and go
hey remember that problem with having to pay
for subscription money into to Docker
desktop that is the deadline is at the end
of this month

134
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,918
remember that big problem we're going to end
up paying like thousands of dollars for
subscriptions or are we going to be charged
for penalties and here's a possible solution
to that

135
00:29:42,278 --> 00:30:00,155
and I'm on my fact I I'm going to step away
for 5 minutes and I'm going to make a post
to my to my company right now about this cuz
it's such a fucking big deal so I'll be
right back I'm just I'm here I'm just I'm
just going to be AFK in bed

136
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:03,398
let me see here

137
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:15,923
what I want to say yeah I know.

138
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,268
I forgot what I called it God damn it

139
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:56,437
yeah but it's it's going to be this is kind
of a place to just hang out during the day
it's not really an agenda it's called
co-working so it kind of like a water cooler
and thank God it is because somebody from
our community just told us about this
fucking amazing news that just broke and I
wouldn't know about I was no way I would
have found out about it without my community
so this is why we just kind of turned it on
and leave it on during a workday

140
00:30:56,438 --> 00:31:03,708
not going to stop I know you if you're easy
mac or Windows you need are going to stop if
you're a common

141
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:13,124
it's like a boot camp in May yep it's called
boost here you go

142
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:24,562
at 50 people in that people know people in
the chat can sometimes help you find us this
is my old one this old one we got a new one
coming but I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty far
away from a from

143
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,566
I'm at you'll see me working on that content
as well

144
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:40,366
if you want it if you want something to do
when your beginner go out and do the Boost
videos and it'll use containers and it'll
actually a teacher takes you through doctor
just stop in there and now you'll you'll
understand why I'm freaking out about this
other one

145
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:41,591
so

146
00:31:44,654 --> 00:32:44,205
I don't I'm sorry if I sound like a
offending when I mean that was a snake, the
person I'm talking about I'm talking about
you know phds in machine learning you have
no legs feels what do we find Brianna
reported to us that an hour ago ranch or
desktop was announced 1.0 version of Rancho
desktop which is a full replacement for
Docker desktop which is a proprietary
software that there are now charging for and
there's the end of the year to the end of
the month deadline and corporate
corporations against thousands of dollars I
order or pay for her ask and beg for
forgiveness and belongings out of that is a
big deal for big Enterprise because a lot of
big Enterprise people people are raised on
your desktop cuz it's nice it's a nice super
happy easy to install that's why I didn't
come in the 2021 boost as we'd like click on
Docker desktop install it run Linux you're
going to go right it's super easy is really
really abusive friend Lee

147
00:32:44,212 --> 00:33:05,034
I was your man it's got a number of bugs it
also works with anyconnect VPN wish to be a
cell does not answer to have to have an
alternative to that that's free at 70% free
and her Apache is a big fucking deal and it
just was announced an hour ago so I guess
I'm going to take a quick little break here

148
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:12,624
and I'm going to make I'm going to create it
I got to go in the crate is all the cast for
this really fast

149
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:20,833
Rancher desktop alternatives to Docker
desktop

150
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:38,985
I sure that stopped was just announced

151
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:48,083
I said I was just it was just an out rest of
the stuff 1.0

152
00:33:50,295 --> 00:34:01,363
I just in time to help large companies deal
with the looming deadline to

153
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:10,609
start paying for their corporate
subscriptions to Docker desktop

154
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:21,564
this is huge all the alternatives

155
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:30,262
Heritage the date I have not been

156
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:35,801
at the same expectation of

157
00:34:35,802 --> 00:34:42,201
of user-friendly interfaces

158
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:49,477
I have not but that I'm not the field

159
00:34:51,782 --> 00:35:01,138
the same expectation of Drop Dead simple
user interfaces to doctor

160
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:10,615
looks like this one does with the added

161
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:18,049
bonus of providing a local securities

162
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,882
cluster out of box

163
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:29,609
instead of tacking it on like the darker

164
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:37,081
desktop tried and failed to do

165
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:44,829
this is fucking huge news for those making

166
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:47,752
Enterprise decisions

167
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:58,574
about container tooling for their developers
in the Enterprise

168
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:10,289
I don't need fucking in there I don't know
man we're going to see

169
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,270
it's like a rock years now yeah

170
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:23,507
God bless God bless his yeah

171
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:37,701
the problem with that Frank you know they
they say oh you don't need to worry you just
use Docker desktop but why on Earth would
you want to learn something that you can't
take with you into the Enterprise that
doesn't make any sense to me

172
00:36:38,121 --> 00:37:00,450
the whole point of learning this shit I mean
come on how many unless you're an educator
or you're doing it on this side the chances
of you wanting to learn Docker just because
you're a hobbyist is very low the reason you
want to learn Docker and be productive on
your desktop with doctor is because you want
to carry that skill into the Enterprise in
your job

173
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:05,225
and by learning a tool that's going to limit
you

174
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:10,555
belonging to all this going to limit you it
makes ya NASA TV

175
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:17,354
oh thank you yeah I got it I got to go
report that one live with him I know it's
here

176
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:44,233
thank you thank you thank you Tony has been
helping me out with some of the so I can the
guys if they know people here we are this is
a co-working space right so we are doing the
same thing we would do if we all were four
different companies were sitting in a coffee
shop together right we're exchanging knows
we're getting our work done we're
interfacing with our individual teams and
we're helping each other out that's that's
what we do here

177
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:51,809
I want to meet the doctor hobbyist yeah

178
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,465
if I had a question with polecat

179
00:37:54,715 --> 00:38:20,424
poke poke it is the one that we have no but
they already working in Ponca City right now
we're already having outages for that so
there's another one now that it's been kind
of bouncing around at the same time and I
can't remember I just randomly saw it I
wanted to I mentioned it on my status
meetings it has like there's another one out
there related to breaking out a dock or
somewhere I just want to make sure it's not
a repeat of the same thing we already know
that

180
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:23,103
so that might be the one

181
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:36,118
kids doctoral devops tools

182
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:44,070
a Rancher false

183
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:49,338
we can put a link here

184
00:38:54,044 --> 00:39:01,554
major bug registry access yep that's the one
that the read axis one is the one

185
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:13,917
yeah I can you always bleeping computer

00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,746
how to link address

195
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,162
I like this nothing better I could just
cleaner to read

196

202
00:41:52,930 --> 00:42:15,164

thing because I don't necessarily want to
tell everybody in my entire company that I
stream it's not like I'm hiding anything but
but I don't like blasting you know external
resources for stuff that I have been doing I

you want to go take a peek other people have
copied it done different things some people

tangent though thank you for saying so you
just reminded me that I can actually go to

lesbians

222
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:39,842
all right here's the question here's a
question do I send

223
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:48,687
do I send this link to my Twitter to my team
or do I send the individual links separately
from

224
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:52,810
from what's in my Twitter what do you think
is better

225
00:45:57,645 --> 00:46:21,355
people calling was mobiles all the time and
you know what they don't have no idea I
lived in Utah it's like it's like the state
car of Utah and Colorado because why because
he's so flexible you can go skiing with it
after you can pay with cash on the top you
can sleep in it it's fantastic fact I'm
going to go mountain biking in Moab I'm
going to take the invert a call you with me
I am was just no reception over there is
nothing like a satellite or something

226
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:27,708
I thought I didn't mean to pry.

227
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:38,246
The people make fun of sooner or Subaru
Outback because they say lesbians on them

228
00:46:38,461 --> 00:47:25,599
I was I was River got him a lot I was a
mountain bike guide for full year and I was
a river by guy dinmore if you if you want to
go we can organize oh my God we can organize
a white rim trail trip it's like a 3-day
trip on the White rim trail people do this
in a day like really monster mountain bikers
we could we could do we could do the white
rim trail I could totally guy that shit we
just we just need to get the equipment we
need to provision it we need I can probably
take it in my outbox the Outback and pull us
like maybe one other but you have to have a
really good four-wheel drive to do it it's
like look into it is called the white rim
Trail Moab it's a phenomenally amazing
mountain bike trip it's amazing and I can
even again he's when he's organized it

229

all right fine back to work back to work

230
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:59,054
you don't we can do what we could do like
art of the ex excursions like instead of
having like a conference or some shit you
can say hey everybody I'm going to be in
Moab for a week and you know right here I
can take the time off that's what's great
about being a contractor if you're a
contract as long as you let everybody know
and you're okay with not making money during
that week you can take the week off any time
but you have to have money you have the
money to do it hasn't yet and I'm delivering
balls and stuff it's one of the greatest
advantages of being a full-time employee

231
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:07,905
it was like it's off Clifton dude yeah
lesbian here drive 97 Ranger there you go

232
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:21,808

and

234
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:39,190

four-wheel is it for is it for Ben Hur is it
for Banger I have for men with turbo

241
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:48,922

242
00:49:58,405 --> 00:50:05,443

244
00:50:13,364 --> 00:50:14,886
that's your homework

245
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:26,151
God damn it I screwed up my thing and dammit

246
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:29,825
I just want to fire service in expectation

247
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:37,048
4A

248
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:45,422
yes

249
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:54,664
I'm going to leave this on the screen so
people can can fall out while I'm away

250
01:00:14,052 --> 01:00:30,743
but you don't know when the five minutes
started do you if I missed could have
started ten minutes ago I don't know I don't
know we ain't nobody knows anything about
that wretched of stuff cuz nobody's tried it
yet I haven't

251
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,191
zelle

252
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:40,071
yeah I don't know it's going to be really
fast I hate the fact that it has a built-in
kubernetes that uses vm's instead of

253
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,915
and I don't know I didn't make you was going
to be you know what

254
01:00:45,452 --> 01:00:53,328
I thought we could actually try that for
this task that we're doing right now is
going to use me to Q for it but I know I
don't know

255
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:01,463
so I mean should we go install it right now

256
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:03,820
why the hell not right

257
01:01:04,323 --> 01:01:10,786
let's do that I'm wondering if we can
actually do this all flying task and kind of
test this out at the same time

258
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,840
why is this from Sousa

259
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:27,991
wait what did Susan by Rancher am I going to
sleep

260
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:42,804
even to the get a release when did that
happen holyshit I've been I've been out of
it I've been trying to keep up on The Last
Ship. It's so I used to spend an hour in the
news everyday

261
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:51,736
when did Susan by Rancher goddamn you know
what's interesting this is Microsoft
positioning

262
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:59,648
Microsoft has a huge stake in Souza it has a
huge stake in it

263
01:02:00,165 --> 01:02:07,646
this is super interesting if if we have to
talk about this

264
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:16,113
Microsoft Souza relationship they like
control of it

265
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:26,613
I want to say there it is so disinterested
bility

266
01:02:28,594 --> 01:02:36,592
made it on Panic, your pocket says listen to
it really threw me for a second Microsoft
Rancher ice what I'm saying

267
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:46,960
Susan is still pushing Microsoft proprietary
software the relationship between Susan
Heroes read this one this one trying to tell
you if you're new to this to this thing

268
01:02:47,156 --> 01:02:53,928
why is it taking so long you have like a
virtual machine running or some shade

269
01:02:54,343 --> 01:03:01,146
hey there's a Gemini version what the hell
David Gemini version

270
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:18,225
Gemini's that you know new text message
Nanette version it's not good but it's
better than sitting right right going to the
same as I have learned from the lessons
after the aftermath of navales the patent
scam just going to go shooting with this is
what when was this

271
01:03:18,407 --> 01:03:20,927
I just doing 20

272
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:26,687
information about tonight's meeting as a
relationship with Microsoft Souza still
works closely with Microsoft

273
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:35,905
and it costly promotes us a proprietary
software is Q here

274
01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:44,361
one of the developer advocates for sap is
one of our longtime community members we had
actually interviewed him about it

275
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,019
I like to hear guys that works for you

276
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:52,452
can I re kiss wrestler Emma I was afraid to
use the kids R Us

277
01:03:52,455 --> 01:04:00,432
yeah that's actually not a bad thing God
damn it takes a long time to serve these up

278
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:04,124
Sousa to is becoming oval again

279
01:04:04,124 --> 01:04:08,620
choose his own independent and make matters
worse it's helping Microsoft

280
01:04:09,149 --> 01:04:15,793
I'm telling you yeah

281
01:04:15,937 --> 01:04:22,800
I do see where the industry is going I mean
it's pretty obvious right

282
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,743
I feel like I feel like Microsoft is

283
01:04:27,744 --> 01:04:37,397
come on Microsoft Champions itself as being
the leader of developers developers
developers tools if Microsoft actually pulls
this off

284
01:04:36,036 --> 01:04:56,015
pause this song off and they integrate Susan
Rancher with of yourself to see everything
just works and they're going to have a solid
competitor against Docker entirely and
they've already got inroads against things
like openshift and stuff because they've got
it already got a counselor there all these
big Enterprise because Microsoft

285
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:59,535
I just tons of Microsoft shops because
Microsoft

286
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:07,308
that that's as receivers as a man and that's
not worth like guessing about

287
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:14,510
why should your financial Abs if the stores
are forever to do with the drive from
companies selling what type of ice cream

288
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:21,226
oh my God Susan actually did a Blog about it
I don't know

289
01:05:23,282 --> 01:05:30,711
my favorite ice cream store is just it's
just off Richmond Green close to where I
live in London also need a local cues around
the block

290
01:05:31,009 --> 01:05:49,049
geladas okay fine we're both OS agnostics
Asuza percent of us to Monday no problem I
have you been a redhead customer for dick
into want to play it and that's what you
will see the Rancho understand organizations
use to Saturday's on specific Linux distros

291
01:05:49,887 --> 01:06:02,827
northerner take it you know what the money
is good and that's good because I like Ranch
her I really do I've always liked Rancher I
like the people at Rancher I like I mean
Corliss came out of Rancho right

292
01:06:04,787 --> 01:06:08,932
Susan rental as we continue to respect his
decision because we're focused on the things
on

293
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:15,955
yeah I'm with infrastructure agnostic
pictures of some of them for treating cloud

294
01:06:17,813 --> 01:06:24,757
yeah Rancho Vicky's real see you soon as I
heard it I knew it was based on case with us

295
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:51,095
and if people and people tell me all the
time that you should use k3s or Michael
Cates instead of a 3DS is that it's it's
it's not it's an edge kubernetes distro so
it's I don't know how real it's going to be
but it's going to be no less real than kind
romantic you probably right I mean and then
they could go to a real cluster then you got
to do a big red thing on music loud

296
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,260
so

297
01:06:54,484 --> 01:07:02,464
interesting news to me today I found out
that Susan acquired I got to add a note here
for myself

298
01:07:05,004 --> 01:07:11,802
is that crate did not know Sousa

299
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,137
acquired

300
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,023
fuck

301
01:07:32,951 --> 01:07:35,748
news about

302
01:08:18,748 --> 01:08:20,598
wow

303
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:57,575
I just need to put that in my in my notes

304
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:07,481
I don't need any more all right

305
01:09:11,336 --> 01:09:17,388
I did something wrong you shouldn't have new
you shouldn't have that

306
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:25,209
I shouldn't have that worst performance
depends what you're doing is what you're
doing but yeah go is way faster than python
on every front

307
01:09:26,276 --> 01:09:37,598
vanilla can raise a micro Gates kind of like
a 3s will because it's been on the edge as a
full thing right as an independent thing hbm
each whatever machine

308
01:09:37,848 --> 01:09:44,883
I kind of know what it kind of makes me want
to install k3s into my as a distro generally
mean

309
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:51,343
in fact is there is there already a Linux
distro that does k3s

310
01:09:55,422 --> 01:10:01,975
I don't I don't know I don't I don't know

311
01:10:03,193 --> 01:10:04,876
Que Sera Sera

312
01:10:06,638 --> 01:10:12,142
now I'm kind of thinking I might want to
duplicate 30s as my is on my Mac

313
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:22,521
you know yeah kiss your ass yes all that. I
knew but the question I have is

314
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:27,949
if that would be better for a bigger
deployment as well I've been feeling it
might be

315
01:10:29,534 --> 01:10:47,596
Advance Auto cuz I mean if I need to do
things like texting too fast on the road. I
mean that's right of that big one or
something things like it is you can say hey
I want this OS and I want to try this and I
want to so stressed and right now I need to
recreate my current system and not in some
extra thing at their favor for
demonstrations about how to

316
01:10:47,696 --> 01:10:54,123
you know about about how to get to do those
go back to off lining everything that's the
task for that does the task at hand

317
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,857
so back to what it says in the title

318
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:07,432
all right sweetie crates in pods and you
create a number of nodes three nodes

319
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:10,198
for serious work I agree

320
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:22,472
I agree and any any any time you leaving to
write storage classes and stuff like that
right you kind of need to know how to do all
of them and it's bad enough knowing how to
do one but it won't all

321
01:11:22,531 --> 01:11:33,176
I have a Destiny is Big Ranch yard because
the Retro Windows it was promoted oh well
wishes for Friday and on you it's not the
same thing that was it

322
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:42,123
ha anyway all right so let's do let's do
this

323
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:48,620
I want to know it's it's running all the
pods

324
01:11:53,315 --> 01:12:00,251
shut restart

325
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:05,745
restart the node maclear to known

326
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:13,384
and bring it back into the cluster

327
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:24,295
monitor that everything

328
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:29,063
gets distributed properly

329
01:12:29,065 --> 01:12:35,158
or time it's a pretty easy task to do I just
want to do it really fast

330
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:39,832
at the edge yeah

331
01:12:39,846 --> 01:12:47,064
watching his twin sheets were absolutely
absolutely

332
01:12:47,065 --> 01:12:49,535
so serious work

333
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:56,805
I know it is I know it is for serious work
and it's kind of tiny in awesome so it's why
I'm talking about

334
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:12,306
at the edge usually means while processing
power but it also means a bunch of
point-of-sale nodes in inside a Lowe's
hardware store right

335
01:13:12,307 --> 01:13:16,088
that's what's kind of any Edge got lots of
meetings is right

336
01:13:16,089 --> 01:13:34,710
the edges hey I have is I have a single
server on site with my retail outlet and I
have a bunch of points sell computers and
they're all phoning home to my internal
carre's cluster which in turn phones home to
some master cluster instead of having a ton
of you know modem connections

337
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:38,553
yeah you didn't you like retail it

338
01:13:40,753 --> 01:13:57,349
which is great because the edge like that
means that your your your entire company can
still work even if your internet connection
to your Upstream goes down or your buttons
don't work and not going to think they can
take credit card transactions that way
though so it's kind of weird I don't know
how that's ever going to ship I don't have a
lot of experience in retail lie to you but

339
01:13:56,147 --> 01:14:01,082
Missouri till it but I do know a little bit
about it

340
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:06,397
Lowe's is headquartered here so I know I've
known people over the years that work there

341
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:41,802
instructions are given a standout in a room
in the store displays are locally yeah
that's exactly what I was talking about for
us right that's a fantastic example thank
you for that is a fantastic example when
people say. He's on the edge that's one of
the core meanings of it another one is in a
bunch of tiny devices or using kubernetes on
it on a on a martian Rover so that
everything is all covered entities by all
the sensors are all independent and they're
reporting home to a central brain within the
same you know tiny tiny thing and collection
tiny things

342
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,391
addition automation pipeline yep

343
01:14:47,295 --> 01:15:29,902
on address and animal Razorbacks running
back well that's my theory on that is is
it's a lot of the people are doing sensors
stuff right so the more complicated
applications they have multiple sensors with
multiple independent systems and some people
can develop independent systems that use the
sensors of that device or whatever and then
they had rather than just having and then
they have more redundancies and stuff like
that so they can get all the same kind of
creators redundancies on like a robot that's
got multiple things from him you know a ten
each one of the sensor kind of knows would
be it would be would be a note and then you
can have it redone to see that way so

344
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:35,127
but I don't know I don't know that's that's
what I've heard

345
01:15:36,863 --> 01:16:00,631
yeah that's that's what I think that's what
the edge means bottom line is you don't
assume you have it's kind of like offline
first and web development you never you
never trust that you have an internet
connection dude you can do some crazy shit
with Progressive web apps using offline
first you can have an app run entirely
without any access to the internet using
service workers is so cool

346
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:08,750
all right so what am I doing back to this I
need to get I need to get a server

347
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:22,111
and I think I'm going to go ahead and make a
I have to remember how to do multiple nose
and kind not kind in mini Cube I think I
could just do Notes 3 knows from the command
line

348
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:28,918
thank you I know it's funny I don't I don't
I go back in for 30 minutes even kind of
can't remember them both

349
01:16:31,948 --> 01:16:39,216
YouTube create no it's not start yeah

350
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:42,488
start Dash p

351
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:49,024
well I mean if we do it like this is can use
a darker driver

352
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,635
note off

353
01:17:01,109 --> 01:17:04,455
HD virtualbox

354
01:17:09,473 --> 01:17:14,934
I'm going to have to tell at 3 now it's I
think I have to use a configuration file for
them

355
01:17:16,976 --> 01:17:33,048
yeah when I deliberately didn't put corn and
rain in there on purpose because I don't I
want the I want the lab to read like a I
need to take my nose off safely how do I do
it and they don't know the term corn and
Rain yet that's why I didn't use it

356
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:42,885
because I want the challenge to be hey you
need to know what these things are called
and stuff I didn't want to give him too many
hints for myself this is making it into the
lab you know here's what you're being us to
do

357
01:17:42,886 --> 01:17:46,500
this would work for like testing yourself or
somebody else

358
01:17:49,182 --> 01:17:55,643
which I can't remember how to do this to
create multi node

359
01:17:57,241 --> 01:18:04,953
cluster with mini Cube there's like there's
like Yahoo files for this I just don't
remember it

360
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:11,672
Monsuno there it is notes is it dashed knows
is that it fuc

361
01:18:11,673 --> 01:18:18,880
I feel I feel bad yeah

362
01:18:24,635 --> 01:18:29,968
I always put my commands in here because I
want to be able to remember them

363
01:18:30,142 --> 01:18:36,275
minikube start Dash p I've known

364
01:18:38,825 --> 01:18:43,551
test note off test

365
01:18:49,065 --> 01:18:53,227
note off lab Dash

366
01:18:58,636 --> 01:19:04,873
dash nodes we want to note so they give us
three total things

367
01:19:05,985 --> 01:19:11,909
and fuck I should be it build

368
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:20,608
this is going to use Docker goddamnit I
didn't want to use docker

369
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:30,927
I guess I can use the car so I can be many
keys are for the Falls now if it finds
darker on your system uses darker instead of
instead of her Suboxone whatever

370
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:40,273
ruins your day I'm going to offline yes

371
01:19:41,905 --> 01:19:45,254
yes please throw a ton of wrenches into my
day

372
01:19:45,528 --> 01:19:53,297
yep I'm going to create a bunch of Damon
sets and shit on there that I unscrew
hoonigan statefulset I really want to see
what it does with the staple said

373
01:19:55,378 --> 01:20:00,288
it's about as long as it is but I don't know
if

374
01:20:00,453 --> 01:20:05,497
anywhere to find out I'm going to simulate
this you know this way

375
01:20:07,504 --> 01:20:12,051
doing doctor like that provision like that
is like way faster than anything else

376
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:30,528
I don't know if you can do this what kind I
wish I would have kind of it even though I
don't know I don't know

377
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:38,078
what are the reasons I want to do this as I
want to I want to see if it leaves behind
like container ship

378
01:20:39,483 --> 01:20:49,785
and when you use Mini Cooper kind you don't
get the container you can get the bar logs
container stuff because it's using it it's
using the container and I don't actually I
wanted you to be among us

379
01:20:49,787 --> 01:20:52,376
I want us to be honest cuz it's not real

380
01:20:52,608 --> 01:21:14,834
at the part of our flying part of the
problem with our planning stuff like I want
to practice Viola pull of plug if you pull a
plug out you leave a bunch of shit bunch of
container overlays around and you have to
clean that shit up and if you don't know if
we've had this problem before so you can't
really test that with a Docker container
because doctor is doesn't do any of that
storage stuff

381
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:21,977
I mean it does but it's using your
underlying system will release you have to
fill that thing I want to make sure

382
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:31,250
Custer of virtual machines just make sure
not using docker

383
01:21:31,382 --> 01:21:38,007
and emulation yeah I don't feel comfortable
with that being a real test

384
01:21:41,533 --> 01:21:45,144
I'm a doctor down that no

385
01:21:46,298 --> 01:21:52,303
make you delete a speed test

386
01:21:52,565 --> 01:21:59,591
when I call okay get clusters

387
01:22:01,495 --> 01:22:03,798
I can't remember

388
01:22:07,967 --> 01:22:15,875
what is it gets a I do remember

389
01:22:17,909 --> 01:22:21,578
status of status of stars

390
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:27,536
make a profile has that's what I want I
forgot

391
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:32,002
oh shit we got a lot of other ones are too

392
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:40,886
MK delete clean

393
01:22:40,886 --> 01:22:46,457
that's being a load goodbye

394
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:53,802
nice bicycle Go lessons

395
01:23:37,731 --> 01:23:43,044
did you two do I have a another one for this
but I I added

396
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:51,003
alright so we got closer there is this a

397
01:23:54,099 --> 01:23:59,859
or nothing 08

398
01:24:00,741 --> 01:24:05,621
right driver Dash D

399
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:14,027
I can probably delivered but whatever damn
it

400
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:29,201
what are we doing let's use

401
01:24:42,608 --> 01:24:44,583
all right we have

402
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:54,583
come on where are you is it that shot driver
if it is

403
01:24:56,492 --> 01:25:03,365
then I have are you going to make me write
it out fine Minnie Driver

404
01:25:05,773 --> 01:25:10,803
Builder let me make just need a script

405
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:19,665
two CPUs and to wish GB how come it's 220 as
weird

406
01:25:20,146 --> 01:25:26,303
20 MB of disk holyshit I got 20 gig

407
01:25:28,232 --> 01:25:31,646
hey Rich love you all of you going to be the
same

408
01:25:34,073 --> 01:25:39,824
it should only do two CPUs on the first one
I've ever got to make a config file if I
wanted to use smaller than that

409
01:25:41,046 --> 01:25:48,173
but whatever I can take a lot longer for
some books yeah

410
01:25:49,226 --> 01:25:51,504
are you trying to go get some food

411
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:14,390
oh that Isabel kit bug

412
01:26:16,525 --> 01:26:21,132
yeah okay yeah that's that's that we have
that

413
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:30,470
hey team I can't get notes

414
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:36,453
but I come out what the hell

415
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:51,111
exit again stretching what

416
01:26:57,202 --> 01:27:04,236
shit can you give us any of the cast of yam

417
01:27:06,964 --> 01:27:12,331
that's weird I haven't seen that before

418
01:27:13,691 --> 01:27:16,459
semi truck repair in five or software

419
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,874
I mean

420
01:27:30,463 --> 01:27:32,871
I don't have a firewall

421
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,916
why would that be

422
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:56,469
that's very odd building a network

423
01:28:01,424 --> 01:28:02,514
how do I say

424
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:19,448
as I am looking for 22 on 118 Washingtonian
Boulevard

425
01:28:32,146 --> 01:28:34,566
everytime I can recognize you

426
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:40,315
what is like a standard versabox problem

427
01:28:41,527 --> 01:28:47,134
I want a bigger it made everything that by
default I know

428
01:28:49,903 --> 01:28:55,075
I don't know I want to fuck with this cuz I
do not have time

429
01:28:55,295 --> 01:29:02,354
but almost I was off what

430
01:29:05,818 --> 01:29:09,510
what the hell I started one

431
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,874
what is the meaning of life

432
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:28,835
what what's the Nickelodeon by default Amino

433
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:37,462
I guess it's route IPA

434
01:29:39,201 --> 01:29:44,964
isn't one when I come in 68 and 199 this is
totally fine what's the problem

435
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:51,012
all right well

436
01:30:02,552 --> 01:30:03,722
haha

437
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:14,317
that would be a big ol no can't get to it
what is fucking up my routing

438
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:23,264
and that's that's the first time I've had
that problem that is obviously there

439
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:29,768
I don't have is you have is DFW different
thing right

440
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:36,017
you know I think I might have installed it

441
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:45,126
yes I do I do I turned off firewall D and
now I have you if I want to think

442
01:30:45,216 --> 01:30:52,558
is that an a bunch of thing is federal d a a
redhead thing and you have w a bunch of
thing

443
01:30:52,996 --> 01:30:57,257
I am okay I need I need to make a thing
about that

444
01:30:57,466 --> 01:31:04,593
is Ivan and I haven't been in for a while
and for much firewalls it 12

445
01:31:06,976 --> 01:31:14,292
I'm coming yeah I knew about that one myself
for awhile. I was confused because that's a
red hat thing

446
01:31:19,883 --> 01:31:23,708
apparently you have w

447
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:30,126
is The Omen 2 equivalent

448
01:31:30,127 --> 01:31:35,039
of firewall D on red hat

449
01:31:35,336 --> 01:31:44,266
it is active yes it's definitely active so
it would turn off right now and and all
things will be fine and that actually
explains a lot

450
01:31:44,268 --> 01:31:51,425
explains a lot just disabled yep

451
01:31:52,654 --> 01:32:01,734
so that I learned something today so yeah it
wasn't there so I just needed to disable

452
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:08,363
that's now I don't know when that was added
to tell you the truth

453
01:32:08,665 --> 01:32:14,635
I think it might be the default I should be
able to SSH. No problem

454
01:32:14,948 --> 01:32:17,443
or not

455
01:32:22,176 --> 01:32:25,021
and yes I love you status

456
01:32:29,683 --> 01:32:37,392
okay fine I suggested it could have been
running

457
01:32:36,278 --> 01:32:42,079
could have been running but still an active
I see you're saying I didn't check that

458
01:32:43,631 --> 01:32:49,336
yeah I was going to say I've never had a
problem with me to get for this not once

459
01:32:50,066 --> 01:33:00,604
I have never had a problem I've used me to
keep a ton and I've never had this problem
before course I never use mini cube with
virtualbox is a percent of usable box

460
01:33:00,982 --> 01:33:05,238
as so apparently doesn't get to it so you
know who knows

461
01:33:12,173 --> 01:33:19,570
cluster

462
01:33:20,705 --> 01:33:25,307
I do find it odd that it actually made a
virtual it didn't clean it up

463
01:33:26,253 --> 01:33:29,013
Sirius using look at the network immigration

464
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:40,345
yeah where did that did we not I mean

465
01:33:41,925 --> 01:33:49,508
is it a zero is on $10 or 0 to 200 isn't we
always doing the same thing again

466
01:33:49,572 --> 01:33:56,980
I seen the same netted primary interface
shit again it's all I wanted to know when
it's 1:10

467
01:33:58,029 --> 01:34:00,788
is it that makes me think that

468
01:34:03,258 --> 01:34:08,603
I don't know what that makes you think that
is me to keep using favorites in full stuff
up

469
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:19,302
or is it that there's a big difference of
boxes to Fallsington out on everything is
automatically making everything that'd I'd
maybe it's a virtualbox setting for Nat by
default

470
01:34:20,269 --> 01:34:31,906
and that's why the primary interface is it
the same problem you're having a better day
with the bigger stuff and 80 is by default
this you know other other thing

471
01:34:32,672 --> 01:34:39,769
I think that this is actually a I control

472
01:34:40,824 --> 01:34:47,109
what's the h I didn't mean to power the
machine off God damn it

473
01:34:47,449 --> 01:34:50,693
but I guess it's off now

474
01:34:54,414 --> 01:35:02,373
yeah not say that

475
01:35:03,352 --> 01:35:10,171
it's billing stuff not as a default and I
feel like there's some default setting

476
01:35:10,689 --> 01:35:15,115
yeah that's what you so silly I just like
the other ones we've had

477
01:35:15,117 --> 01:35:21,481
and I love you. We've had this before so
that means this makes me think

478
01:35:21,564 --> 01:35:26,301
but I would really like there's some bucks
only make one network interface

479
01:35:26,302 --> 01:35:34,762
I'm starting to think that I've used for
some box before and it only has one I
already looked at that we didn't already
that's the one I need to address

480
01:35:35,635 --> 01:35:42,819
and I can look again but the thing I want to
do is I want to get virtualbox to make stuff
that only has one adapter

481
01:35:44,429 --> 01:35:51,892
add I did already we talked about

482
01:35:54,588 --> 01:36:02,083
a network configuration I'm of what a mini
Cube or of

483
01:36:02,355 --> 01:36:05,010
on a machine

484
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:13,891
has Anarchy figuration Avenue is it

485
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:32,562
in the menu five and this isn't there's some
default for virtualbox

486
01:36:32,563 --> 01:36:34,863
host network manager

487
01:36:38,765 --> 01:36:43,193
there we go there we go

488
01:36:43,272 --> 01:36:54,903
host network manager so these are the
different workers that works at H creating
for everything and this stuff was probably
created with acorns

489
01:36:54,903 --> 01:36:59,603
yeah that's what's going on all right

490
01:37:00,193 --> 01:37:05,838
yes of course I've seen that I am never mess
with a number to monitor before

491
01:37:07,634 --> 01:37:15,089
yeah it doesn't find I would rather prefer
Messi address

492
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:27,621
are you here but why is making two adapters
at 20%

493
01:37:30,464 --> 01:37:33,183
he doesn't have nothing I got a few yeah

494
01:37:42,202 --> 01:37:43,859
I sent her face

495
01:37:48,442 --> 01:37:51,620
I'm just trying to think every surf we

496
01:37:58,574 --> 01:38:00,340
Hale Community one

497
01:38:10,504 --> 01:38:22,424
let me see there's another Network layer and
there's some sort of there's some sort of
firewall in your dad and going on inside of
her two boxes killing Elsa never had that
problem

498
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:30,246
I'm going to search for here I'm going to
give you an yeah I'm almost positive you can

499
01:38:31,282 --> 01:38:33,569
yeah let's bring it up again

500
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:52,027
I rent a room in and out a toboggan it's in
that

501
01:38:53,531 --> 01:39:03,557
send that when is 11 was not going to
support virtualbox and then I tried it and
it worked it was like from 2,000 121 super
happy that that was not true

502
01:39:06,371 --> 01:39:11,818
I mean him

503
01:39:13,155 --> 01:39:20,890
it was impossible to see I realize I'm sorry
so everything you were paying

504
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:29,529
90 route 168 1

505
01:39:30,427 --> 01:39:32,791
well can you get to the router

506
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:51,811
yeah that would have been where they didn't
block it that they did look it actually it
was because they said they were going to
drop their restrictions on on security and
stuff and so it effectively eliminated it
from the list of stuff that supports Windows
11

507
01:39:54,400 --> 01:40:01,801
there's no router and that's that's kind of

508
01:40:02,213 --> 01:40:08,822
kind of bad XVI

509
01:40:09,693 --> 01:40:17,495
all these extra volumes audition I'm not
used to doing that a lot

510
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:22,384
inconvenience in at 1

511
01:40:25,713 --> 01:40:28,368
Estes Park Tramway Center

512
01:40:33,551 --> 01:40:38,411
so interested yeah I would love to see if I
can find out to be really surprised if it's
Florida

513
01:40:39,362 --> 01:40:43,764
I drew out show yeah this is not stuff I do
everyday

514
01:40:45,327 --> 01:40:51,719
is it fall Trout's condemned it's tiny how
can I zoom in

515
01:40:53,339 --> 01:41:01,336
I can probably turn the phone. Scale mode

516
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:09,615
oh God Chrissy. Better

517
01:41:11,676 --> 01:41:18,506
I think I'm going to bring some over some
more better if such better graphics support

518
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:23,425
I need the results are yeah

519
01:41:25,719 --> 01:41:42,665
that's exactly what it was and I hope cuz I
want to try it I want to try when it's 11
today or the other day and it works so it
wasn't it wasn't it has the same issue so I
figure out what surrounds I think it's the
whole default route issue again

520
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:50,200
Define annoying I mean I don't know we're
going to find out huh

521
01:41:50,446 --> 01:41:55,037
network operations manager you're not Active
network operations

522
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:00,183
so

523
01:42:05,559 --> 01:42:11,695
yes it was just nice it is nice that it does
that

524
01:42:13,767 --> 01:42:16,771
I like I found it is I'm going to go do a
little search on this

525
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:30,388
I'm going to look for this air again and
after the thing

526
01:42:32,749 --> 01:42:37,699
damn it that's not good stuff should be an
issue this is for suboxone supposed to just
work

527
01:42:38,472 --> 01:42:42,302
so if anything doesn't work because of
something else is going on

528
01:42:43,509 --> 01:42:48,611
is an alternative VM driver

529
01:42:51,584 --> 01:42:56,319
restart the restart wait did I not do as a
virtual machine driver

530
01:42:58,686 --> 01:43:06,318
restart restart or reinstall virtualbox I
mean that might be the problem

531
01:43:07,535 --> 01:43:14,900
on your house you might flash your public IP
he's not I don't use that I don't give a
shit

532
01:43:17,046 --> 01:43:22,546
it's the 171 I'm not drunk that internet

533
01:43:25,234 --> 01:43:35,470
as much as shit on here and we have a lot of
stuff on here

534
01:43:37,934 --> 01:43:45,568
you know if I want 17 address digital
internal though

535
01:43:46,712 --> 01:43:58,314
I got so much shit in here and look at all
these Bridges I should probably go I read
this is why you should because of you cuz I
I should probably just read redo this
machine

536
01:43:59,594 --> 01:44:01,693
I can't be all down

537
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:09,573
any boxing that stuff

538
01:44:10,234 --> 01:44:15,547
and I don't why are they down there not down
I didn't take him down

539
01:44:15,799 --> 01:44:20,447
I didn't take him down there listed is up on
me on virtualbox

540
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:26,386
so what's up with that anymore

541
01:44:26,915 --> 01:44:32,676
how the ship how did they get taken down we
pumped up them then we done

542
01:44:35,243 --> 01:44:43,011
poison ivy I can pick up I remember

543
01:44:45,807 --> 01:44:47,450
yeah

544
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:55,961
well that's a different that's a different
command than I used to use I've realized
that you like 20 up

545
01:44:57,092 --> 01:45:04,450
what do I have a good down though maybe it
maybe it didn't have didn't have them

546
01:45:09,489 --> 01:45:14,146
key locks State up

547
01:45:20,953 --> 01:45:23,704
2 2 2 2 2

548
01:45:27,468 --> 01:45:35,326
nope eyes of the IP change

549
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:41,862
oh right because it might have grabbed a new
one from dsv

550
01:45:41,862 --> 01:45:46,071
if you have a night

551
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:56,990
so that's the underlying interface to the
virtual machine with that directly change
the Russian machines IP address

552
01:46:00,027 --> 01:46:06,090
I mean I would seem really weird to me yeah

553
01:46:06,091 --> 01:46:09,025
I've had one of those two dead box

554
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:18,694
it's just another route why are we why are
we adding another Alto

555
01:46:26,382 --> 01:46:37,169
is that I can't because it we didn't die at
CP it because mr. to step right now it's
right it's this s e run from the other
scripts to pull and pull down the days of
the address yeah I see what you're saying
it's up

556
01:46:36,382 --> 01:46:50,285
it's up we just added have an IP yeah I
seriously okay yeah this is the stuff that
the description we take care of for you
right okay yeah I haven't years I haven't
set up my own stuff yeah

557
01:46:53,660 --> 01:47:03,185
192.168 I have a feeling if I restarted for
suboxone clean everything up it would just
work so I don't want to be Leah confused
here

558
01:47:09,375 --> 01:47:14,274
I'm not used to yeah so

559
01:47:17,716 --> 01:47:21,118
he walks up yet every l

560
01:47:22,421 --> 01:47:28,932
and should be able to bring it now yet an
SSH to it

561
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:35,636
yah yay yay team

562
01:47:38,696 --> 01:47:45,233
at and then I can do there's no password
password less

563
01:47:47,984 --> 01:47:53,393
I don't know password dude I was on the
terminal, so that's why

564
01:47:54,145 --> 01:47:56,136
yeah it's not going to allow that

565
01:47:56,693 --> 01:48:02,975
it's not because I didn't want to terminal
this is as remote As to associate has
probably got to see this really is it

566
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:08,722
what

567
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:15,807
the two

568
01:48:23,942 --> 01:48:31,920
yeah anyway so well because we brought the
interface up

569
01:48:32,514 --> 01:48:39,497
it was a thing as soon as you can because we
brought the interface up in the host system
so that means that the virtualbox

570
01:48:41,904 --> 01:48:46,904
network interface should be configured
properly for when I do this

571
01:48:48,408 --> 01:48:54,655
I'll look at gave it to it wait that wasn't
there before or was it

572
01:48:55,105 --> 01:48:58,110
but I don't get that me this this

573
01:48:58,926 --> 01:49:04,143
play the Spider-Man surprise anymore by the
rabbit hole which rabbit hole

574
01:49:07,019 --> 01:49:12,248
yeah I don't have those all the time so so
this one

575
01:49:14,677 --> 01:49:22,203
yep this one is the thing I understand is
that these things are here

576
01:49:22,628 --> 01:49:25,082
this is an adapter issue

577
01:49:28,163 --> 01:49:30,633
is it a host adapter

578
01:49:36,254 --> 01:49:53,227
yeah right I'm tempted to just take out the
Birchbox manager is it reinstalled and I
have noticed so that when I install
uninstall verse about sometimes it leaves
around networks network interfaces and I
hate that I think it's a bug I think that's
a bug

579
01:49:57,434 --> 01:50:04,965
yep anyway we'll give it a shot that's all.

580
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:12,322
Play or stop close power off

581
01:50:14,903 --> 01:50:18,006
I think there is but I don't know it

582
01:50:18,006 --> 01:50:43,900
I got to stand I don't I usually don't deal
in this much with virtual machine this is
been a lot of I've been doing doctor for
last year and a half so I do all my stuff
inside rocker and I think I went to Great
Lengths to stimulate workstations and nose
and doctor and so this is going back to
Mercer machines is a totally different thing
because you have to manage on your faces and
volumes and everything so it's so you got to
know it

583
01:50:46,001 --> 01:50:51,531
and all these things are off a date you know
the stuff that they've created might be part
of the problem

584
01:50:56,118 --> 01:50:58,450
what I'm going to give again

585
01:51:02,268 --> 01:51:06,441
hip alright so

586
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:14,217
they're going to allocate all that again
what's inside

587
01:51:14,267 --> 01:51:17,463
all fun stuff and if

588
01:51:17,405 --> 01:51:32,041
and it gets messy though cuz you get you get
so many virtual interfaces doctor creates
its own interfaces and the overlays
everything it makes your whole system like
we should you kind of wish has some point
that your whole system was was a virtual
machine

589
01:51:33,008 --> 01:51:40,655
but then you can't have a virtual machine
inside a machine unless you're using my
clippers something I mean keep her

590
01:51:44,526 --> 01:51:45,798
yeah

591
01:51:52,702 --> 01:51:53,981
yeah

592
01:51:55,894 --> 01:52:17,297
this is one of the reasons to that you
should kind of get used to reimage in your
system all the time and as Doctor Professor
would love to hear me say you should
probably not be streaming from the same
system because then you know I can fucking
around on another system and then just have
the video piped-in through capture card and
then you know you guys can see it the
problem with that is

593
01:52:17,523 --> 01:52:23,142
that you know I have to switch keyboards to
do that a lot and I don't want to

594
01:52:23,361 --> 01:52:27,324
hey look at works because it has an
interface

595
01:52:29,597 --> 01:52:32,255
I know that already exists as much as I do

596
01:52:43,766 --> 01:52:47,866
configure want versus box driver warning

597
01:52:48,348 --> 01:52:55,129
it's like there's a driver there are there
options for better performance to support
use KVM to nope

598
01:53:01,576 --> 01:53:06,880
is my credit one node which annoys me

599
01:53:09,876 --> 01:53:18,594
Irvington Raceway but it's the first time
I've ever

600
01:53:19,465 --> 01:53:25,472
and those primary will be ignored the
cluster node off lab already exists

601
01:53:28,744 --> 01:53:34,598
no dad dad knows an existing cluster what

602
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:41,210
it doesn't make any sense any human being
weird

603
01:53:44,021 --> 01:53:48,833
I guess it just did a control plane yeah

604
01:53:54,251 --> 01:53:57,674
Espeon ode

605
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:04,356
all right now we're on here with their user
ID

606
01:54:09,844 --> 01:54:17,200
Docker how do we darker oh I know I know
I've never mind

607
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:19,416
nevermind

608
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:31,756
far no Etsy

609
01:54:33,136 --> 01:54:35,441
container

610
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:46,887
retainers that's a Saturday

611
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:55,094
config. Tell Mall 38

612
01:54:55,094 --> 01:55:00,776
that's cool so you can learn a lot by the
how they can figure there's

613
01:55:00,777 --> 01:55:07,707
key rhenium there is no cure ATM and they
said it was configured with your video and
now there's a video

614
01:55:07,862 --> 01:55:13,498
I don't know if I believe him and then I
keep CDL over here

615
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:20,163
Cuba NM

616
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:27,282
I'm thinking I lied I read somewhere that it
they said me to give us configure Wikipedia
Missouri I don't believe it for a second

617
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:34,042
1 times something about Ms

618
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:45,821
yeah I'm going to need more evidence of that
so

619
01:55:45,893 --> 01:55:50,969
I don't I don't know if it's looking for a
time that Ms or not

620
01:55:52,197 --> 01:55:56,931
yeah dude Benchmark that let us know so

621
01:55:57,736 --> 01:56:00,658
I'm not convinced this is going to be any
any easier

622
01:56:02,178 --> 01:56:10,275
I don't know I kind of want to say going for
this cuz I don't know I don't know and I
don't get my getting warm fuzzies

623
01:56:10,777 --> 01:56:14,036
no offsets

624
01:56:27,054 --> 01:56:31,013
running configured

625
01:56:35,077 --> 01:56:39,770
I don't know. Maybe I would actually do
something more specific

626
01:56:41,558 --> 01:56:47,733
yeah I wouldn't I would use something like
hyper what's it called

627
01:56:51,182 --> 01:56:53,167
No I can't remember the name of it

628
01:56:55,107 --> 01:57:01,345
there's a bunch of like bench markers out
there it stopped this from one of the best

629
01:57:01,726 --> 01:57:07,677
oh hey how's it going Kelly thank you for
the Patriots

630
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:10,159
let me see here we can do

631
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:21,600
I really really don't want to have to do
this separately but I'm going to do it

632
01:57:23,249 --> 01:57:25,142
that's pee

633
01:57:28,717 --> 01:57:36,046
I know note off lab but I want no dad

634
01:57:38,713 --> 01:57:41,184
all right sending us a new node

635
01:57:43,105 --> 01:57:50,519
I wonder what I wonder what Robertson Box is
doing we should probably check

636
01:57:57,506 --> 01:58:02,978
hey. I have no. 5 in 02 is now running

637
01:58:06,365 --> 01:58:11,836
so note to self if you see many give you
have to have multiple commands

638
01:58:12,747 --> 01:58:15,812
a app that multiple commands

639
01:58:19,134 --> 01:58:21,009
descendants 1

640
01:58:21,796 --> 01:58:30,479
takes a lot longer I was going to run slow
or make big made a big complaint saying hey
we don't think you should do this you know

641
01:58:30,635 --> 01:58:38,188
make him sad want Russian box driving
warranty as I'd rather not have that thank
you very much

642
01:58:42,062 --> 01:58:48,273
let's stare at another one what's up

643
01:58:55,025 --> 01:59:00,017
personification really ironic

644
01:59:01,707 --> 01:59:07,206
I don't know what happened to the adapter I
can't imagine what would have changed on
that though you know

645
01:59:09,013 --> 01:59:13,258
and it could have been any number of things
we've been fucking around virtualbox all
along you know

646
01:59:14,064 --> 01:59:30,174
I'm learning a lot about virtualbox volumes
and interfaces though so that's good might
had no idea that you can add a virtual box
in her face and then manipulated directly on
your house computer but it makes total sense
I just never had a need to do that before

647
01:59:31,138 --> 01:59:53,754
which means I need to get back into a
network interface Administration test and
learn all that shit all over again I I I did
it a long time ago to set up my own routes
and everything was one time but I can't you
know it's all changed its all-new you can't
really do for structure engineering without
knowing how to do that though you got to be
able to check your network stuff and
everything so

648
01:59:53,755 --> 02:00:02,110
I see you don't really need any compounds
now I'm at a cloud

649
02:00:02,113 --> 02:00:28,662
I'm all about one friend that's what I do at
work and so I don't really care about
Clinton that the truth is is it called if
you learn the 7 learning applies to Cloud
it's like Cloud plus so if I ever need to do
Cloud I just had to use the interfaces for
cotton figure it out but I'm more of a
non-friend person so I'm speaking which I
want a find the best on friend Cloud
software that's not openstack

650
02:00:28,665 --> 02:00:37,443
and that's actually something I'm seeking
because I have a bunch of machines I want to
make my own cloud at home and then you start
for Monett stuff like that so I'm looking
for that for

651
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:43,139
I'm looking for that for about proxmox and a
number of others so that's something I've
been researching

652
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:49,412
you do need to do to be a me didn't you
didn't you do the cluster for me to keep

653
02:00:53,342 --> 02:00:59,687
oh Ray Wright thanks for the reminder
everything yeah

654
02:01:00,149 --> 02:01:06,520
how's it going at 11 so so we are off and
running

655
02:01:06,862 --> 02:01:09,156
we're at the races

656
02:01:10,481 --> 02:01:16,558
I can't get Noah's we should get a bunch of
notes are there we go this is what we're
doing

657
02:01:17,243 --> 02:01:20,011
I'm running pop OS but I don't really like
it

658
02:01:20,611 --> 02:01:33,490
I've been running for a while and it runs my
winter and and and you know and Dota 2 in
TF2 and all that so I've been keeping it for
now but I'm going to boot it eventually

659
02:01:33,812 --> 02:02:04,931
I can't find a sitter start screaming for my
Mac and then use the current yes, she
neither is a gaming rig which is what it
actually is or and I can put Windows on
there and then get another server and
provision I think I don't know that
approximates everybody's been saying proxmox
proxmox give you fight at home and I want to
do it and I want to add a bunch of machines
have my proxmox and speak I don't have none
that have a have a no no rabbit holes

660
02:02:05,846 --> 02:02:13,092
I'm working I got it I got to focus and I
almost getting hungry so that's the coffee
small

661
02:02:13,515 --> 02:02:18,644
what are we doing here what are we doing
wrong so

662
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:25,370
all right you know what for giggles and
grins I'm actually going to listen to take
time but I I would rather do this

663
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:34,837
I'm going to oh shit what are you sending me
Brioni more sidetracks

664
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:45,254
oh God

665
02:02:56,287 --> 02:03:01,601
when did this happen you telling me he got
hacked

666
02:03:04,123 --> 02:03:07,162
he didn't get hacked or did you do it

667
02:03:20,897 --> 02:03:24,299
I think somebody's making fun of him right

668
02:03:30,257 --> 02:03:37,331
I don't know how to raise if I could have
one can I read Harry commits under you are
proud of your l

669
02:03:38,074 --> 02:03:46,568
anybody describing how to install I just saw
him our voices can be under your name

670
02:03:47,242 --> 02:03:50,400
as as if you made the command

671
02:03:52,285 --> 02:03:58,646
holy shit this is huge this is huge

672
02:03:59,427 --> 02:04:06,448
no wonder you should sign your commits huge

673
02:04:14,206 --> 02:04:18,402
that's a perfect that's a perfect lesson
right there

674
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:29,971
yeah

675
02:04:30,364 --> 02:04:33,651
that is amazing

676
02:04:38,796 --> 02:04:42,528
this is a commit that wasn't signed right

677
02:04:43,185 --> 02:04:48,260
did he actually did he actually break the
tree with this

678
02:04:50,488 --> 02:04:58,431
I think it did that's not a branch how does
he even have access to do that

679
02:05:10,642 --> 02:05:17,516
all Torvalds didn't do this Diddy there
wasn't make that post

680
02:05:16,382 --> 02:05:18,787
thorvaldsen make that post

681
02:05:30,118 --> 02:05:33,749
yeah wow

682
02:06:06,793 --> 02:06:12,683
I mean how does he even get to claim it soon
it didn't have to get home

683
02:06:13,079 --> 02:06:15,396
it's just an unsigned commits

684
02:06:19,657 --> 02:06:24,601
security is not associated with a repo wow

685
02:06:40,241 --> 02:06:42,071
to to do

686
02:06:58,685 --> 02:06:59,878

that's the same one thanks me too cute yes

688
02:07:28,677 --> 02:07:34,681
nobody knows how to sign him I'm just going
to teach people gpg in the Moose god dammit
thank you for that

689
02:07:36,085 --> 02:07:39,587
nobody wants to learn as a stage 1 lung gpg

690
02:07:44,972 --> 02:07:48,069
we're never going to be done whenever

691
02:07:49,027 --> 02:07:53,608
I'm deleting the same building in the end
because I don't trust it so

692
02:07:55,473 --> 02:07:58,680
El Amor H added to get to her yeah

693
02:08:00,495 --> 02:08:11,833
x-ray it's not that hard it yeah I mean I'm
thinking about doing with 11 year olds right
so and yes they can do it but it's like one
extra thing

694
02:08:12,425 --> 02:08:16,582
and I can tell you what I'm just I like to
think of your things and you know Baseline
rule

695
02:08:17,426 --> 02:08:22,291
are you Cube delete Dash p

696
02:08:22,917 --> 02:08:28,266
no off while I'm deleting the whole Lab and

697
02:08:29,212 --> 02:08:31,743
I'm going to add another one

698
02:08:32,182 --> 02:08:39,468
because I want to do this is because I want
to build all three at the same time and I
don't think I should have to do them
individually

699
02:08:41,293 --> 02:08:49,167
Nelson doesn't show up and told her I was
giving history so he has no idea block fuck

700
02:08:49,874 --> 02:08:57,477
that is like something to learn how to do hi
chef I really want to learn how to do that

701
02:08:58,263 --> 02:09:00,582
I want to learn how to do that

702
02:09:01,772 --> 02:09:08,112
why is Netgear sending me advertisements for
entities oh my God what is the world coming

704
02:09:15,271 --> 02:09:22,805
I hate snacks okay what are we doing in case

705
02:09:22,807 --> 02:09:25,725
we're we're trying to

706
02:09:25,856 --> 02:09:31,097
do the very basic task six pack in his teeth

707
02:09:31,741 --> 02:09:40,902

I'm at a surf don't get that six-pack back
that's not here now it's been like if you
can see the scale of

711
02:09:56,118 --> 02:10:02,644
you can see the scale of like technical
skill and physical health should be like
this

712
02:10:03,025 --> 02:10:06,248
psych psych psych undulating wave

713
02:10:06,768 --> 02:10:14,222
like my skills in the last week and a half
is like skyrocketed through the roof with
technology because of the stuff he's been
doing

714
02:10:14,456 --> 02:10:20,786
but so has my waistline it's cuz I have not
been doing any exercise at all

715
02:10:22,705 --> 02:10:25,279
I know it's like

716
02:10:26,315 --> 02:10:34,153
I told her I thought it said look at this
look at this beer belly hurts cuz yes but
think about your brain where is your brain
right now and then we had sex

717
02:10:37,744 --> 02:10:43,863

serious about to settle KVM to drive
everywhere

722
02:11:19,348 --> 02:11:22,396
because kbm

723
02:11:23,155 --> 02:11:39,893
I love gave you my lover lover to get all
the work and everything I've been using
virtualbox for this Elsa want to be able to
have visibility into it and I know I can do
this with the manager and all that stuff
right

724
02:11:41,379 --> 02:12:07,157
right now I'm seeking commonality across
operating systems more than I'm seeking
because this is the method of doing this I
want people to be able to do anywhere right
that's the main reason today and despite all
its quirks and slowness and everything
virtualbox is far more cross-platform
compatible than all the other ones I found
out the other day on Mack and stuff but

725
02:12:07,159 --> 02:12:13,577
I don't know if I would if I would sell them
oh it only added one

726
02:12:14,672 --> 02:12:20,544
is it because I said to nodes I didn't think
I was kidding did it how's it going

727
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:30,278
yeah I'm definitely your knee came out of
that

728
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:38,189
Miami macaroni suddenly yeah we found that
out who are You the One recording reporting
that yesterday

729
02:12:38,190 --> 02:12:44,130
yeah I don't know if it ever will be you
know

730
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,994
I see what's up yes

731
02:12:47,994 --> 02:12:55,516
yeah I thought I thought the control plane
was included obviously it's not so we're
going to do this

732
02:12:56,325 --> 02:13:03,973
I did what I was wanting it to do though so
we're good to go 73 notes are next time so
that we can do

733
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:07,268
I make you

734
02:13:07,268 --> 02:13:12,840
no dad that's pee test

735
02:13:13,653 --> 02:13:42,386
there's also a shoebox regional manager gave
him the yeah I know I've been using a ton of
the whole thing for a full week like a week
ago and I don't know what I came to do and I
was doing all the thing and play around with
the liver provider for terraform and ansible
and vagrants and we got all that working and
everything and and then I was really
weighing it against

736
02:13:42,391 --> 02:14:14,749
you know how is this going to be Universal.
I mean I think it's good to learn that it's
just very specific I feel like a lot of the
stuff has been based on Boost decisions
which are going to be for beginners and
teaching beginners first I think is not an
optimal choice I think you should teach
beginners virtualbox first assuming it's
going to run a Mac it if it doesn't it's why
I was checking out the other stuff there's
lots of uses for virtual machines and
involve a lot of it

737
02:14:14,753 --> 02:14:21,386
but this wretched episode it is did you
dress it Victor did you test it for sure

738
02:14:21,386 --> 02:14:24,469
can you please talk about that specifically

739
02:14:26,466 --> 02:14:29,669
yeah if you're doing that

740
02:14:31,221 --> 02:14:37,972
oh my God that is I got to put on my notes I
got to put in my notes send my notes

741
02:14:49,625 --> 02:14:51,651
wow

742
02:15:17,796 --> 02:15:21,557
and that is that super duper huge

743
02:15:28,136 --> 02:15:58,146
the reason I'm pausing is because if I want
to do I've been trying to make decisions
about how to get people that Unix Linux
command line the fastest for the Boost and
boost in 2021 I tried Docker desktop and it
really tremendously well the downside of it
obviously was it you know it was a femoral
we had to show him how to reattach and all
that stuff but made it was good because all
the extra effort to to reinstall Andre app
and saw everything I think worked well yeah

744
02:15:58,243 --> 02:16:10,394
I know that's if Victor it's wet and So
based on this discovery today I do not want
to leave and One max out of the boost on May
4th

745
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:23,497
and I think the information that you've just
reported may be enough to have me switch
over to rent or desktop as the basis for the
beginner boost to get a Linux terminal in
the fastest way possible

746
02:16:23,801 --> 02:16:52,516
otherwise I feel like this might be the main
way to do that and if you just download the
binary and it just works I mean that's
fucking crazy amazing easy easy peasy kind
of stuff for beginners to do so again the
reason I have a beginner boost every year
and the reason I redo the content every year
is because the tech industry changes the
tooling changes so quickly

747
02:16:52,551 --> 02:17:00,874
and I know yes yesterday I would have big
long fucking post about why we should use
virtualbox and learn DM's right

748
02:17:06,848 --> 02:17:09,309
I'm like I am so torn

749
02:17:10,592 --> 02:17:47,934
get that let them is be real here this is
primary thing that promoted me to use
virtualbox over over again was vagrant and I
was about to throw bait or not the window
because it's so old and busted and uses for
being used as a liver it was a pain in the
ass to get going and most of vagrant is is
is Neo Taylor 2/2 box give me a virtual
boxer slow and horrible and I had slowed
down my my stuff when I switched over to bet
it was primarily vagrant that set that 4 and
then at that led me to think hey we need to
have a we need to have a virtual box systems
so people can try out different distros

750
02:17:49,538 --> 02:17:57,322
yeah doctor easy solutions the problem with
the doctor easy solution I know we can make
it work as we did last week last last year

751
02:17:58,074 --> 02:18:04,857
does not use doctor absolutely no no they do
not use docker

752
02:18:04,858 --> 02:18:13,307
it's fully doctor compatible but it doesn't
use doctor I mean you can make an alias for
an urgency to yell or whatever and use
Docker and said

753
02:18:13,729 --> 02:18:18,452
yeah it has a doctor yeah so

754
02:18:18,945 --> 02:18:52,157
I need the lightest-weight best way to get a
Linux command line is darker on the desktop
hands down. Hands down it take s to install
Docker desktop or its replacement Rancher
desktop and it takes 10 minutes to get Linux
up and running on it just like that you
don't have to download I supposed to have to
install anything it's just works it get you
and by the way it doesn't come with a lot of
extra shift so you have to add it and adding
the stuff helps you learn how to use the
terminal and we had fantastic success with
that last year

755
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:57,547
but all this stuff about all this reminder
recently about using

756
02:18:57,770 --> 02:19:12,736
okay the other primary driver for using
virtualbox was that people could test out
desktop Linux distros and arrived at 1 that
they want to use but here's the deal I'm
about to throw up Linux on the desktop
myself

757
02:19:12,736 --> 02:19:17,558
because I don't give a shit I want I want I
want Linux in my

758
02:19:16,038 --> 02:19:41,382
clinics in my containers that I would Linux
on my service I could give a shit about
having Linux on my desktop it doesn't give
me anything extra at all it doesn't it gives
me the opportunity to strip things but I can
do all that from Sun container or a VM or
whatever my point is is I don't need it I
don't need it on my desktop and that's
that's like me I'm a big person but to say
that you don't need it

759
02:19:43,373 --> 02:19:57,189
what I want to know is if that conflicts
with the Bissell 2x anybody test that we
need somebody I need to go to that we need
to go test whether doctor weather Rancho
desktop will work on

760
02:19:57,345 --> 02:20:06,709
we need WeatherBug working a double cell
enable system protector that's got any
connect from from Cisco VPN because that's
the thing that doesn't work for me right now

761
02:20:10,417 --> 02:20:18,400
yeah you decide what is a Rancher just
stopped using her to jail or doctor owe you
can't you can do the doctor

762
02:20:18,437 --> 02:20:21,272
you can do docker

763
02:20:21,621 --> 02:20:30,660
if you do the darker does that give you
access to the docker Hub and everything cuz
I kind of want to kick people off Docker Hub
but it's just so easy to use it so I don't
know if you know

764
02:20:31,738 --> 02:20:45,332
anyway this is like really thrown my
conclusions about switching to a virtual
machine in the air I really have to say and
I'm actually going to post a link to those
to those things right now

765
02:20:48,001 --> 02:20:50,715
is that link

766
02:20:55,010 --> 02:20:59,316
so I guess not

767
02:21:18,106 --> 02:21:23,521
when does risen box fails to boot extra
driver serving abroad

768
02:21:26,951 --> 02:21:28,801
see this

769
02:21:33,734 --> 02:21:39,734
running on a surprise that requires episode
2 holyshit

770
02:21:39,735 --> 02:21:49,667
it is still standing still too but
automatically oh my God you would have pain
in the ass it is getting kids to install
them in SO2

771
02:21:49,996 --> 02:22:09,997
that's fucking insane let me just going to
configure properly and everything okay so
the only thing that we have to test on that
is to make sure it works with anyconnect VPN
if if a container running inside of it uses
anyconnect VPN because it breaks and it
works properly we are fucking golden I mean
that it's like massive news that is really
great news

772
02:22:10,001 --> 02:22:48,554
all right if if that works then I don't want
to use anything else ever and I want to
start everybody on it like immediately
because they can take that with them they
can do mediately to doctor they can do to
bring at least another two more terminal
skills that they could ever want they could
create a femoral containers that also
Mountain you know dislike we're going to
like it in the in the thing so they can have
their files and not lose them they can make
sure you say, get everything and then they
can learn virtualization later during
infrastructure engineering boost and at that
point as I've said I'm not really married to
Virgil McEver the thing that like there's
two primary drivers for virtualbox I'm going
to let me go through

773
02:22:53,323 --> 02:23:18,966
and I I'm kind of annoyed by this this is
Versa vice versa Boxster wish you were doing
right now so I'm about ready to throw it out
and just gave him to his why the fuck are we
using for some box I mean really I'm
listening to what you have to say here's my
primary motive is this is what got me to
change my mind where's the Vox just hurts
everywhere it well it kind of doesn't write
is also really slow right but that

774
02:23:18,969 --> 02:23:26,507
this is this is a lie this is a lie I'm
going to put an update in here

775
02:23:33,857 --> 02:23:38,370
I work on M1 Max

776
02:23:38,405 --> 02:23:51,297
and has been known to not be supported on
Windows 11 in the past

777
02:24:06,562 --> 02:24:10,623
questioning this conclusion he's conclusions

778
02:24:16,133 --> 02:24:19,231
I sure desktops is out

779
02:24:28,144 --> 02:24:30,539
x86 system yes

780
02:24:31,749 --> 02:24:40,747
but I don't want that look so so my criteria
for picking a best personal experience has
been

781
02:24:41,374 --> 02:24:47,477
I can you send anywhere I can you know you's
gooeys

782
02:24:47,995 --> 02:24:55,364
allows for safe experimentation I want to
try ten different Linux distros were two
boxes the only way to deal with the pain and
suffering

783
02:24:55,382 --> 02:25:00,554
right where's the Box machines have
persistent state

784
02:25:00,777 --> 02:25:56,949
so does the other things that's it this is a
big plus / containers for beginners
beginners get burned by the ephemeral nature
of containers all the time but it's actually
a good thing because it because then they
have to learn how to mount discs in and use
GitHub and stuff like that and they can
learn to detach and reattach it's not a
problem it's all I know what happens if they
wipe out the containers so glass and 2021 we
did it fine because we didn't teach him how
to delete their containers in your container
and then they would reattach that container
and start it back up and it was persistent
it was only it was evidently died when you
deleted the container with you in dark we
have to do explicitly so I still think we're
okay there are some box machines have a
persistent say what type of that virtual box
machine images of real as this true this is
true we don't get this slimmed-down version
so I'm fatter right where's the box has been
the primary driver for vagrant yeah but if
we can get around vagrant

785
02:25:56,956 --> 02:26:04,384
who gives a shit there's a box of the
command line and lightweight images this is
true

786
02:26:04,758 --> 02:26:32,157
it does you can use for tomorrow in the
command line to talk to things I just hope
his fryer suffer any longer for your
business. You're just a bit but this is just
been deflated do this is one of the main
reasons and now we have rent. Thanks for
services can run Docker this is true and
Lennox person who she's going to doctor
Windows Virtual machines cannot I cannot
imagine having somebody run Dr inside a pop
OS running inside of a VM

787
02:26:32,223 --> 02:26:35,670
average of boxes better driver than Mini
Cooper darker

788
02:26:36,839 --> 02:27:01,897
no it's not even that many people now the
fall doctor if detected it makes a little
sense to do it kind that's not does Doctor
container such things now it's not a fast
we're going to just give him two for them so
that that third that third piece of evidence
is to me hey how's it going thank you for
the sub I send me that and that is

789
02:27:02,856 --> 02:27:07,036
this M1 Mac support thing is huge to me

790
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:38,278
all right so so as of this moment I have to
test it still I'm almost concluded that we
are going to use ranch or desktop for for
2020 and I just told everybody yesterday
when they own thing that goes over to box
and then he was like I can't function just
over two bucks and I'm like no go install
something like why are you changing your
mind so much is it going to just fucking
came out and it's the tech industry get
fucking used to it

791
02:27:38,288 --> 02:27:43,473
I hate taking a shit for changing my mind
2022 in it

792
02:27:43,518 --> 02:27:49,057
2021 Bruce Willis doctor desktop 2022 we're
going to use

793
02:27:49,445 --> 02:27:58,492
and as of this moment we're going to answer
this job just for the M1 support if for no
other reason that we're ever going to try it
or is it going to try it

794
02:28:00,769 --> 02:28:04,034
did I say 2020 I meant 24:1

795
02:28:04,066 --> 02:28:12,584
did I change my mind all the time and I
can't ship for it constantly from people
that know me I'm like welcome to the tech
industry

796
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:18,298
I don't know how many times I go back and
forth between get home and get lab

797
02:28:19,272 --> 02:28:24,350
there's there's compelling reasons you have
to make it all you got to have a cruise this
year

798
02:28:24,351 --> 02:28:36,627
Sapphire 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 to boost will
as of this moment I'm going to test it up
till yesterday or just now we can use
virtualbox so now we're going to

799
02:28:37,895 --> 02:28:46,189
here's a real thing though how how much how
much do I really give a shit about helping
people test their Linux out there desktop
Linux distro

800
02:28:47,058 --> 02:29:17,800
and I barely saw it on this particular point
I'll I don't give a shit about desktop Linux
I really don't and you know what I love it
and it there's a lot of reasons I I like it
but I'm not as long as I have a good Docker
container deal with the work in someplace
I'm fine and I get work done plenty good
that way and I've been told it you know if
you pee in some of those downloading why do
you keep downloading things like that run
under McCraw or Windows raw so if that works
and I why do I even need it

801
02:29:18,414 --> 02:29:19,657
you know

802
02:29:20,301 --> 02:29:31,691
so this is this is complicated for me this
is, and the words I am in the boots I may
actually be advocating to not protest doctor
on your desktop

803
02:29:32,201 --> 02:29:57,920
I mean is 2022 the options the remote on
this particular with dr. I mean sorry with
with ranch or desktop now how's it going up
now I have to say very openly before chicken
with ranch or desktop. If you have your own
mini communities cluster and W still to
install fault and you have going on there

804
02:29:58,994 --> 02:30:35,320
and and all you have to do is install
Windows 10 on what you have to do with
Windows little bit with whatever you got
everything you need you don't you do if that
turns out to be true I need to validate that
right now we didn't is brand new and it came
out 2 hours ago if that turns out to be true
you do not need Linux on your desktop in
fact I cannot think of a single reason to
put Linux on your desktop other than the
regular you want you know Linux prawn in
full control and you want to edit out and
and mess with you no gnome is actually
pretty cool guy some pretty cool stuff in
her face is like that but other than that
why why why

805
02:30:35,326 --> 02:30:50,253
and I'm going to tell me put a challenge out
there to the world strong toolkit fictions
loosely held I think I agree so this is
Cheryl. There's a very Devils out of it
challenge

806
02:30:50,254 --> 02:30:55,884
why on Earth would you run Linux on your
desktop why

807
02:30:56,359 --> 02:31:03,567
and I mean that I mean that I want people to
take me to TASC on this particular Point
Expo deck

808
02:31:03,859 --> 02:31:21,100
it is raining right now and you feel
offended I'm not attacking you I'm asking
you a question why are you running Linux on
your desktop if it's a desktop reference
okay. Would be a very solid Point very sore
and I have very specific just a practice
course I live in the terminal so I don't
give a shit

809
02:31:21,334 --> 02:31:28,290
a lot of UPS don't work with it okay that
would be doubly so too but but we

810
02:31:28,291 --> 02:31:38,001
what I'm trying to tell you is one of the
ways to work around right now right now my
number one way to work around that wsl2
issue is to use Docker desktop

811
02:31:38,002 --> 02:32:24,959
and I know it's a guaranteed easy way to get
around that issue because it Bridges the
network and that the thing I have right now
the number one thing I have to do this is
because if if Rancher desktop does the same
thing that darker does sub this with regard
to networking it will automatically bridge
to the VPN network and it will fix the issue
I'm trying to tell you is that ranch or
desktop could very potentially be the fix
for the anyconnect of yourself to issue
because it installs of yourself to as a part
of it this is all pie-in-the-sky I haven't
touched any of this yet but if this is true
then ran her desktop is literally the holy
grail for desktop for desktop Enterprise
Linux on Windows it's a holy fucking Grill
because it it will take care of all that
stuff

812
02:32:24,963 --> 02:32:32,391
I can't install virtualbox on in my VPN I
can't at all I'm not even allowed to use it
at work I can't install it

813
02:32:32,422 --> 02:32:40,166
I kind of someone is living in a said I'm
going I'm going to Lenox if Windows doesn't
want me okay what were some of the things

814
02:32:41,388 --> 02:32:48,197
can you run Kali from USB yeah it's pretty
cool Kelly stuff like that would go he's

815
02:32:49,073 --> 02:32:53,832
yeah I know that stuff I would be interested
to talk about you

816
02:32:53,841 --> 02:33:08,368
all the stuff with gooey still works by the
way the end of yourself too right you know
you can use full Ghillie applications on
Windows you can use you can use x
applications on windows with them is so too
and they are 100% the same

817
02:33:08,369 --> 02:33:17,431
I honestly just easier to manage apt in his
soul and all that stuff yeah but I mean all
the Snapchat that just happened I might be
on the Run for the Hills

818
02:33:17,432 --> 02:33:18,984
and Iand I just share folders yes

819
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:37,986
cuz I have my Canon stuff when it's 11 and I
said I'm going on Lisa Quinn doesn't want me
that make sense that's a good reason to go
look I'm running now and I like the
flexibility and then really immediate

820
02:33:38,954 --> 02:33:46,271
don't use it but still here immersive
learning is a reason to sawdust up Linux I
would be another good reason

821
02:33:46,872 --> 02:33:55,405
that would be a good reason Elementary OS
that's one of the many ones I want to try
Elementary and it was of all the arch
distros is the one that I want to try the
most

822
02:33:55,782 --> 02:34:15,745
yeah I haven't tried it I haven't tried it I
wait I could really cool I do like a really
really nice user interface doesn't mean I
want to trade support for my Sound
Engineering and and stuff like that I don't
know I have I tried my job and make brick
tile my machines in my lap and I hate it

823
02:34:16,540 --> 02:34:22,025
I know right I normally that you just like I
like my voice to mine

824
02:34:22,509 --> 02:35:22,555
until lately lately it's been degrading
Buffalo us is having really bad problems you
probably seen him my menu system is all
booked up they got rid of they got rid of
all tab performance the way it was working
before our enemy has four years when it says
offer more freedom for my job and learning
however I'm going to resend me the full
switch and still keeping my wages when she
forgave me yeah what a year. It's a whole
thing dude I don't want to do this in my
journal story right now. There's somewhere
of me talking about it but I'm lying to me
and a bunch of people in my lab clicked on
their graphic system upgrade tool and it
break the machine wouldn't do it anymore it
was a black screen and the hole in the
company just said oh you should have done
that you should have went into your extra
TTYL and I said click on this great tool I'm
like why the fuck is the upgrade to live
there and I went to my job because it was it
was heralded as really great easy to use
this room as a piece of shit and then when
people blew up nobody wanted to help them

825
02:35:22,562 --> 02:36:09,925
and I know how to help him I've done letting
the building is pretty much from scratch in
the 90s and and I know how to do that but I
recommended this to begin with because it
was so easy to use and it turned out it
wasn't actually Chris Titus bursitis the SEC
he was he was one of my favorite people who
was the first that's how I found out about
him I watch this video and I had the same
problem like but I had to deal with it and I
had a guy actually cost me money because my
whole life was down I had to reboot and do
all kinds of hacking to get mice in my
system back I was pissed and then and then
he just went the other way and they try to
pretend like it never happened it was not an
issue was a major fucking issue was all over
Twitter is all over their support things and
then all of the Arch Linux heads came out
and attacked all the beginners that were
using mongeral and I was like I want to
fucking thing to do with this community at
all

826
02:36:09,932 --> 02:36:33,998
and then they tried to sell Enterprise
software and sneak it into their distro and
they got caught doing that to their is shit
company the Montero company that Mojo
organization are criminals man they're
fucking I can't believe people even consider
it knowing what I know about them as a
company in organization now they're they're
worse than canonical by a long way like near
really bad

827
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:43,724
yeah I'm sorry if you don't like that if you
liked it fine you can use it you can I'm not
telling you not to use that I'm telling you
my experience to keep these over the years

828
02:36:43,851 --> 02:36:49,921
so I can get to work. Tired of having to
worry about you he thinks you're tweaking
right

829
02:36:53,175 --> 02:37:02,437
yeah most people say I haven't had an issue
there for your wrong and I'm like okay tell
that to the thousands of people that had an
issue when they broke everybody

830
02:37:02,437 --> 02:37:09,391
telling him I didn't have an issue sound
problem I must be going to suck you must not
be a good Lennox person

831
02:37:10,109 --> 02:37:28,419
it's the problem with my drawers it says
that it's just a really awesome happy distro
for beginners and then they go do that and
then they basically the flip off the whole
fucking beginner Community if I'm like okay
if that's how you want to be that's fine you
can choose to do that

832
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:32,125
yeah

833
02:37:33,957 --> 02:37:39,980
yeah I'd ever is the one I would probably
try but yeah

834
02:37:39,982 --> 02:37:57,502
yeah if it was a nice yeah I think it really
sucks about my jarrow is there were so many
people posting stuff you know they did they
flooded the Montreal company flooded their
Twitter feed with positive things about
Manjaro to make all the negative stuff go
away rather than address the negative stuff
they just started

835
02:37:56,096 --> 02:38:21,967
they just started covering it up so that
nobody would know and they were trying to
manage perception and like keep their good
image everything else like you shit heads
they didn't even begin to try to own their
mistake they could have come out and said oh
hey we made a mistake in this one thing
we're really sorry they could have reached
out to people but they didn't they went the
other way and was soon as they did that I
didn't want anything to do with him ever and
ever

836
02:38:24,149 --> 02:38:30,316
is the main reason ceremony right you need
to be better right try harder right

837
02:38:31,816 --> 02:38:44,143
you don't look like they did a lot of people
yeah it was it was a whole cover-up thing
and I was right in the middle of it I was
right in the middle of it and I I don't like
reporting that that way I can make me get
angry

838
02:38:44,369 --> 02:39:44,910
you are a prince all my fault by the way
their whole are you wash it it's green stamp
their whole whole thing to tell you that
they have a safe version of the aor that
they've been total bullshit it's absolute
bullshit it's perception management you know
why because I'm on General organization
wants to get their shit in the Enterprise
They want to be the first Arch Linux distro
to get in the Enterprise and they know they
won't come out of gold and red hat money and
they have been pushing for that for a long
time that's why they got us what a fuked up
with all the Enterprise though they are
specifically trying to Target their TurnKey
Enterprise Linux it's so that they can get
it behind the wall Garden in Forestville do
that and one of the ways they do that is say
so Enterprise people ciccio's you don't like
the way you are cuz it's too scary and it's
unfilled and it's like the wild west out
there you know what we're going to take care
of that for you we're going to fit all of
them and make sure they're nice spring and
cleaning and pretty and happy and then they
say they're going to do the beneteau they're
really doing is rubber-stamping all that
shit there just rubber

839
02:39:44,920 --> 02:40:19,335
GoGo compare some of the packages all they
do is rubber stamp them and they put him
straight into they don't do any wedding at
did you go look at them to go look at their
history on their history of Security
Management to a company that's why I'm
calling criminals there fucking lying to
people telling them that they're trying to
make us safer distro and it's going to be
this and that and they want to get that
sweet sweet Enterprise money and so they
cover it all up and they advertise shit in
the sneaky Enterprise proprietary software
when it makes sense for them till they get
caught doing it and then they rubber-stamp a
bunch of Arc of that even fucking looking at
it because it's too much work to do it

840
02:40:19,339 --> 02:40:29,416
do you know I don't want anything to do with
an organization like that and that is the
opposite of free and open source to me but
if you like there's their distro find go use
it I don't want anything to do with it

841
02:40:29,418 --> 02:40:32,789
alright so

842
02:40:33,329 --> 02:41:31,422
doing yeah they're marking is fucking
amazing right now yeah nobody knows any of
this I know and I meant I know I need to
watch that have I was I was kind of sad cuz
I love the way you know maybe it's just like
the true momentum behind arches is free and
open-source Linux that's what makes the are
you are so fucking amazing it's why the dead
man comes along and says hey let's do it to
you know I'm I'm totally on board with all
that and end the Arts Community isn't an
amazing Community when they're not you know
condescending assholes there are awesome
they're awesome they're promoting Lenox and
a great way they're making their do an NDA
or the idea of having an open you know
repository exchange even though it's unsafe
is great I love it it's like a gate you know
Janelle gatekeeping going on I love all of
the stuff is coming from the arch Community
which is why I find it so tragic that
Montero has

843
02:41:31,431 --> 02:41:42,269
marketed themselves into something that they
think is the best version of that and I
don't think I used it all the time for
different things up

844
02:41:42,270 --> 02:41:49,062
so I look that we can you tell why I don't
tell that story very often

845
02:41:49,519 --> 02:42:01,130
the reason I don't tell that story very
often is because I just it makes me upset
and it was my where's my plushie give me my
plushie

846
02:42:02,614 --> 02:42:12,658
I don't talk because it makes me sad the
story makes me sad people get upset they
feel like there are bubbles or burst and I
just ended and now people get upset right

847
02:42:12,658 --> 02:42:25,878
yeah and because you've been lied to and the
thing is is you don't even know even like
you and if you start to ask them about how
you been lied to do so I don't know what
you're talking about because they covered it
all up I hope some of those forms are still
out there

848
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:37,530
yeah it's if I had to live through it but
you got to understand it was I had married
Munroe I was so excited about it I was
legitimately excited somebody told me about
an hour with this acquisition and I got

849
02:42:36,851 --> 02:43:01,303
and I got so into it and I was helping
everybody use it and I was I was champing it
I was an evangelist and get it and then that
shit went down and I just I was I feel like
my heart has been ripped out I did I don't
like that I don't like that and I don't like
telling people about it I know it's like
it's like telling people you know it's like
ripping down someone's religion the others
know Jesus right there's no Santa there's no
Easter Bunny there's no cheese

850
02:43:01,407 --> 02:43:04,016
and Montrose a bunch of criminals

851
02:43:08,248 --> 02:43:20,373
he's going to come after me of this season
this is saying stop calling us criminals we
haven't done any crimes okay fine they're
not criminals how about that I make a
retraction Banjara is not criminals there
just liars

852
02:43:21,802 --> 02:43:23,660
how about that is that better

853
02:43:25,652 --> 02:43:30,274
oh I just discovered something new

854
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:37,255
if you run if you run from Aziz ears she
makes noise

855
02:43:47,415 --> 02:43:50,692
she has she has buttons in her ears I can
feel

856
02:43:53,644 --> 02:43:57,278
Mozzy Mozzy just became a girl just like
right then

857
02:44:11,681 --> 02:44:23,346
I don't want to read it cured me for my
Manjaro story it totally worked this is
totally threw me from a madrone tree versus
a box I think I'm not going to use it
anymore

858
02:44:23,346 --> 02:44:25,082
that's what I think

859
02:44:25,373 --> 02:44:33,898
y'all are y'all are good for doing that
birthday my bro bubbles I'll roast you and
your Bunch are on Bubble Universe my room
for bugs bubble on that then

860
02:44:34,788 --> 02:44:36,804
God dammit

861
02:44:42,616 --> 02:44:46,131
yeah I'm rethinking it actually really
seriously

862
02:44:48,052 --> 02:44:55,833
we talked about what DP driver I'm probably
going to use to give you a driver

863
02:44:56,518 --> 02:45:01,484
are you seeing proton that's all right
that's how I play Witcher yes I do

864
02:45:01,510 --> 02:45:20,475
yeah but again if I'm running a window if I
put Windows on here I got OverWatch back to
is like a bunch of shit I can do that I
can't do right now and I know OverWatch can
run with a bunch of extra work on Linux I
know I know I know I don't I just want to
click on the button and have it work

865
02:45:23,697 --> 02:45:28,905
an update is that I'm a back yet I didn't
update it

866
02:45:28,906 --> 02:45:37,965
and damn it let's compare so let's do mini
Cube

867
02:45:44,143 --> 02:45:50,072
my mind is swirling in the whirling right
now because you just so many options out
there and

868
02:45:50,072 --> 02:46:00,281
Branch or desktop is just like Tron
everything up in the air I feel like I need
to evaluate Rancho desktop immediately
because if Rancher desktop

869
02:46:00,281 --> 02:46:06,753
God damn Prejudice account with a Linux
variation like right out of the out of the
gate to did you see that

870
02:46:06,754 --> 02:46:27,056
alright alright alright alright alright
we're going to do some Rancher I have to run
to this up if I wish right now you know why
because I can't rest until I know I have to
know if a renter desktop is going to replace
Docker desktop fully and stare for the booze
can use it and then everything that I do up
to that point can use it as well

871
02:46:27,056 --> 02:47:15,117
on a weekend no I'm glad you said it right
now cuz we need to do do do it with you
should see you should see all the people in
my work slacks chat went out to like 900
people and they should see how many people
have liked it and and are like oh my God
this is awesome so by you telling me and
everybody else we all benefit from this like
immediately and and I feel like this
derailment has been valuable I can tell you
right now that you're sharing that bit of
fresh news has provided dollar value to my
business because my business has just
reevaluated a ton of decisions that have
saved I don't know how many total person
hours

872
02:47:15,119 --> 02:47:17,456
and and that is like real fucking cash right
there because you

873
02:47:16,135 --> 02:47:24,563
because you share that with us so I don't
want you to feel bad about that you just
saved a ton of people a ton of time

874
02:47:25,243 --> 02:47:27,430
yeah and

875
02:47:27,933 --> 02:47:46,652
I wish I could give you the rewards I wish I
could have asked I asked which people I like
hey can I and that's what you call the
people who notice people like I want to be
able to give bits to my people seriously I
want to buy a ton of bits and I want to be
able to give bits to my audience

876
02:47:46,779 --> 02:47:56,836
and I want to be able to give y'all B on
problem with that is if they do that if they
do that there's going to be all kinds of
money laundering going on so you can't
really do it

877
02:47:58,960 --> 02:48:13,389
hey and they won't do it because of money
laundering because people would just buy a
ton of bits and give him off and then you
know they can already kind of money
laundering with them that it was serious
loss like a 40% loss

878
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:19,662
it's user hat is a channel right

879
02:48:22,150 --> 02:48:28,346
I think I think you choose or is a channel I
have you have to go to their Channel and
give them B

880
02:48:29,498 --> 02:48:32,240
he just says if you get partnered

881
02:48:34,698 --> 02:48:37,782
I know I think that they should do it I
think

882
02:48:37,882 --> 02:49:14,370
look I would buy I would like pay like 500
in B and when people give me B I would want
to redistribute the wealth to people who are
providing more than just giving people VIP
so like today I would be giving Brianna a
big fucking bitch you know when I would for
something like that and you know anytime
somebody provides a lie to me I want to get
them back I don't want to give him points of
stuff in a moats and all I want to be able
to actually give them I know you wouldn't
want it but but there's there's I want to be
able to actually pay people for her I don't
want to create the wrong you know tone here
I just

883
02:49:14,374 --> 02:49:23,548
yeah but my point is that we get we're all
sharing around something up but I miss her
so much to that I I would I would want to be
able to to get back at him

884
02:49:24,189 --> 02:50:05,448
kids YouTube videos about rounded us up yeah
go watch that in an invite us gaming if if
you're new to Linux in general please let us
know what you think please let us know what
you think because because I'm particularly
interested in what beginners think of it I
know you you think all new nobody cares
that's the opposite because your new your
opinion is more valuable than those have
been doing this for a long time to me
because because I want to say I want to ask
you point-blank what what did you get hung
up on how easy was it to use did you get you
know these are this is really really
valuable information to someone who's doing
mentoring

885
02:50:05,454 --> 02:50:27,085
so please your just as valuable to our
community the beginners are every bit of
that more is valuable because they aren't
helping us identify ways to to help others
and give you skills so let's switch this so
I would do any cube in a cube

886
02:50:27,085 --> 02:50:35,938
I'm a junior system in awesome he will your
dry place then we're going to do all kinds
of amazing things

887
02:50:36,326 --> 02:50:41,424
so it's a great job and I love I love this
job

888
02:50:41,545 --> 02:50:44,954
I'm just checking my my screen

889
02:50:45,914 --> 02:50:57,181
probably set up and refocus are all right so
let me delete this close to her and I'm
going to delete his dinner I'm going to make
it cost without a driver I'm going to use
that the other KVM one so we're going to do

890
02:50:57,182 --> 02:51:05,809
delete NSP test weight node off lab

891
02:51:05,810 --> 02:51:12,507
give me delete that burst of lackluster I'm
going to change my build script to

892
02:51:12,507 --> 02:51:17,984
change the driver I want to see the default
actually if I don't do that it'll use a
darker driver I don't want to do

893
02:51:17,985 --> 02:51:24,686
so driver KVM to write

894
02:51:24,746 --> 02:51:27,481
I think it is

895
02:51:31,223 --> 02:51:33,751
UPS

896
02:51:37,152 --> 02:51:43,098
what is it that we need to do so we have
where's the driver driver driver driver

897
02:51:43,099 --> 02:51:48,924
is she and I plug into use oh my God

898
02:51:48,924 --> 02:51:55,977
we can put Calico on that by default I did
not know you can set your calculator. Oh my
God that's all fucking awesome

899
02:51:58,093 --> 02:52:05,111
if I do that then I'll be like like that'll
be like the one I'm using now the king run
time use dr. Kennedy

900
02:52:05,638 --> 02:52:11,050
shit this is cool because I can recreate my
same system

901
02:52:11,568 --> 02:52:19,399
I'm not a fan of openstack personally how
many is proxmox

902
02:52:20,952 --> 02:52:26,353
see if used to Creole delete disable driver
mounts

903
02:52:32,383 --> 02:52:34,919
oh I don't use a bigger and communities lab
though

904
02:52:35,581 --> 02:53:19,169
I don't know I want to use that lab also I'm
actually a gym trying to test this out
because my thought is that many people
should be able bit faster for this kind of
thing even though the baker Community Club
is fucking amazing to they're all good so
that gives multiple ways to do this is I
think the takeaway here is it there multiple
ways to use kubernetes depending on the task
at hand you know and and that that is
something I really really really want to put
in a chart of some kind or some kind of
graphic when do you pick kind when do you
pick mini cube when you pick mini cube with
this driver when do you pick vagrant when do
you pick a cloud you know there's a lots of
them

905
02:53:20,897 --> 02:53:26,211
oh shit Canadian hyper-converged
infrastructure with Harvester

906
02:53:27,651 --> 02:53:29,360
modern Canadian

907
02:53:32,902 --> 02:53:38,228
assassin people can damn it I love Rancher

908
02:53:41,118 --> 02:53:44,788
it was like a chain or codes oh my God

909
02:53:48,517 --> 02:53:50,273
oh my God

910
02:53:50,798 --> 02:53:57,712
what is this hardware virtualization with
virtualization so they can buy in the
virtualization with the

911
02:53:58,343 --> 02:54:06,333
shit shit too much to keep up with but thank
you for telling me about that. That is so
cool

912
02:54:06,762 --> 02:54:09,068
this so cool

913
02:54:12,847 --> 02:54:19,735
then why are you sexy yeah oh my God that's
crazy awesome

914
02:54:20,657 --> 02:54:29,748
it's as smooth as a fast-moving train isn't
it people it's hard to keep up its hard to
keep up with moving so fast

915
02:54:29,749 --> 02:54:37,163
dr. Damon no doctor download no pod-man
driver is virtualbox VMware Fusion

916
02:54:37,502 --> 02:54:39,740
give him two

917
02:54:41,482 --> 02:54:50,061
I mean what does a default to default to
Auto detect so KVM to

918
02:54:53,669 --> 02:54:56,940
video game to yam

919
02:55:04,015 --> 02:55:10,920
turn off lamp I want to see if that much
faster this is we should time this

920
02:55:11,562 --> 02:55:15,166
California mini sir

921
02:55:16,756 --> 02:55:23,379
oh my God it's so much faster like a ton
faster

922
02:55:24,737 --> 02:55:28,614
it's busier hypervisors busy

923
02:55:29,418 --> 02:55:36,425
yeah SLK is caving in because my advisors
busy going to do another shit yeah

924
02:55:37,981 --> 02:55:44,405
I thought I know I do everything on what it
what is the things on

925
02:55:47,486 --> 02:55:50,443
don't forget to reimage everything

926
02:55:52,795 --> 02:55:59,938
Note offline I mean guess is not running

927
02:56:02,542 --> 02:56:04,859
oh God

928
02:56:07,571 --> 02:56:11,881
I got to tell you that liver is much
prettier

929
02:56:13,575 --> 02:56:19,550
hey there we go I understand

930
02:56:22,927 --> 02:56:25,621
wait what

931
02:56:25,926 --> 02:56:31,654
running me to delete me fix it I did do that

932
02:56:33,730 --> 02:56:37,080
I swear to God I did that

933
02:56:43,862 --> 02:56:51,539
yeah I mean let's be real live vert is way
faster and smoother on Linux

934
02:56:52,646 --> 02:56:57,190
it is that's not a fucking Oracle product

935
02:57:03,262 --> 02:57:14,628
and I really don't give a shit about about
virtualbox because I'm not going to be doing
graphic Linux distros in a virtual machine
ever

936
02:57:15,042 --> 02:57:24,926
the only reason I had that on there is
because people like to try things out before
they buy them but you could also just get an
old piece of hardware and try out all the
dishes on that and see how hard it is to the
install

937
02:57:25,710 --> 02:57:30,060
so I'm I'm I'm today's Rancher thing

938
02:57:30,306 --> 02:57:34,609
has really really really take my interest in
virtualbox

939
02:57:37,578 --> 02:57:44,710
for a Linux VM because you're a kid and you
want to figure out if you want to use I3 or
no more our shit

940
02:57:45,992 --> 02:58:12,585
like I do the veterans out there you don't
know why that would be a thing and you
people that are attracted to my channel like
the terminal and stuff but to the general
look YouTube is full of people fighting
tooth and nail over what the best Lennox
prawn is based on what does Roller using
right so there's two ways to do that if
you're if you're a distro junkie and you
really like the look and feel of a desktop
Linux then

941
02:58:12,913 --> 02:58:21,538
yeah we all started to get use it that way I
don't think that's bad I didn't I I learned
from the terminal and yeah

942
02:58:21,757 --> 02:58:25,032
I'm dead on my job how can I use Google is

943
02:58:26,598 --> 02:58:30,740
well I mean you don't need a graphic event
for that but yeah

944
02:58:30,856 --> 02:58:41,222
is a Xavier a jump that's right and so I
think y'all are you can just leave the point
I'm trying to make is that you need a
desktop right

945
02:58:41,326 --> 02:59:22,650
and if you want that desk talk to me Linux
you need to try that but it's in a part of
infrastructure engineering I don't think it
is also the reason the reason I'm I'm I'm
having second thoughts about this because of
the Rancher just something is because the
infrastructure engineering boost is
primarily designed to give you skills that
involve using Linux as a server not
necessarily as a desktop if you wanted
that's nice but it's not a core critical
path requirements to become an
infrastructure engineer I think you can do
the job complete me from you no Windows or
Mac and I know I do I'm not allowed to have
a litter box for my job currently they will
not give me a Linux laptop

946
02:59:22,654 --> 02:59:46,679
it won't give me an iPad Pro and then send
it to get rid of yourself to issue they will
only give you a Windows machine or a Mac so
you're that you don't have a choice to using
Linux on your desktop there for desktop is
fun it's beautiful it's great all of that
it's also irrelevant when it comes to jobs
that are related to the next unless your job
is providing a desktop environment like I
don't know about over something

947
02:59:47,111 --> 02:59:53,495
Tory songs are playing YouTube channels
right it's crazy

948
02:59:54,086 --> 03:00:23,561
this up any mental or restrict my aunt so
many countries restricted to Mac or Windows
repair using Linux desktop feels right and
it's so I'm not I really want to be clear
here I am not slamming on people who wanted
and Lennox on their desktop I'm just saying
it's irrelevant to Enterprise work in
infrastructure engineering and Cloud native
so having a Linux desktop is

949
03:00:23,563 --> 03:00:31,836
dude I was on today just today right today
the guy who showed me that you noticed
they're all using throw using putty

950
03:00:31,836 --> 03:01:14,206
they're doing their entire job people in
other people to make it for $50,000 a year
using putty it's it losing party or the
using SSH client they're not didn't even
they don't even have one and I'm the one
who's using your cell and I have Lenox and
I'm and I'm like oh my God how are you doing
that because they don't even use them until
2:30 to see pretty in these are young kid
some of them they're not compare to me
they're not it's not like they're a bunch of
old greybeards it just you know they got
stuck using S6 remote these are people
that's that's how work is getting done so
the reason I'm going on this tirade is cuz
I'm I'm continuing to justify the position
but you can do with Rancher desktop of
dropping the choice

951
03:01:14,211 --> 03:01:20,782
drop it will say this dropping the can Ican
I test desktop Linux with it as a Criterion

952
03:01:21,365 --> 03:01:27,660
or first selection of a technology that you
that you learn

953
03:01:28,879 --> 03:01:30,095
Saudia

954
03:01:30,590 --> 03:01:53,027
and finance guys would have to use when I
said it breaks the main reason they don't
want lennox's cuz they can't control it I
also by the way another thing I am not
allowed it's against security policy of our
company for me to install virtualbox on our
laptops this site has blocked you can't
download anything if you do download it
they'll report you for it I can't run
virtualbox

955
03:01:53,540 --> 03:02:33,805
I'm not allowed to run it so I really want
to look at this other options and see if it
gets approved by security right now is
probably not being blocked by the security
so we might have a good chance that if I
don't know where to find out if I block him
and so I installed as well so I'm going to
be really interesting to see you some more
next to him cuz he's our killer clear yeah I
don't like that stuff because it's all
remote I can't build images and stuff unless
I have a connection and I called like 10
years ago if it's switch the results they
had they will eventually but they don't like
my team still on it like a background do
most things from the 7-Eleven yeah

956
03:02:33,811 --> 03:02:41,820
if no I think it's right I think light is
better and to be as low as possible that
enrolls in Enterprises

957
03:02:42,783 --> 03:02:48,860
I love the Linux Bible it's pretty old and
the best thing I would do is

958
03:02:49,303 --> 03:02:54,286
the Linux command line from William shots

959
03:02:54,787 --> 03:02:59,013
it's a little dated but it's the best book
that I know of for Lenox right now

960
03:02:59,467 --> 03:03:03,859
hey I got that pretty looks pretty emotes

961
03:03:06,342 --> 03:03:09,068
I know where's the Box

962
03:03:09,982 --> 03:03:30,842
I might change my mind tomorrow so don't
hold me to it I haven't tested it all
depends on Rancho desktop all of it depends
on Rancher to stop and I haven't which means
I kind of wanted to Serena so I do want to
bring this up though first it said it is
giving me shit because it says

963
03:03:32,721 --> 03:03:38,352
node any other name in wrong

964
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:50,142
profiles I was still there no wonder

965
03:03:50,310 --> 03:03:53,181
I know I didn't give him to what the fuc

966
03:03:56,075 --> 03:04:04,247
I think we're going to check it out yeah but
I'm going to check it out I want to just
give you something really quick and then
we'll check it out

967
03:04:06,209 --> 03:04:11,037
I don't think it's going to install because
I already have a ton of Darker shade
installed

968
03:04:11,704 --> 03:04:20,326
I don't think I I don't think I should
install it on this machine I think I should
install it on my Windows machine maybe I'll
get my

969
03:04:20,488 --> 03:04:23,431
i r l camera or something

970
03:04:25,665 --> 03:04:52,845
we don't need to check it out y'all need to
check it out let me know we already have one
really big report that came into I don't
remember who did it we had a Mac and one
user reports that that ran for desktop works
with the M1 Max and Linda and virtualbox
does not as a huge huge bit of info right
there

971
03:04:53,057 --> 03:05:12,378
since Sunday I don't think that that's just
it's pretty much just sailed system be as
the defaults on everything that matters
whether or not I like it is irrelevant so I
don't really spend time talking about that
too much you know

972
03:05:12,379 --> 03:05:18,719
he was a reporter a Victor Victor Victor I
forgot to bitu

973
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:25,372
any of the IP for you I just wanted you to
people who help us

974
03:05:28,585 --> 03:05:42,062
and again I would be paying you B and stuff
like that if I could but I can't so that's
all I can do is because I don't know how
many is 25 or something

975
03:05:45,887 --> 03:05:50,166
yeah I know but that's just a fun thing to
do so

976
03:05:51,366 --> 03:05:58,748
well that's why I hear so many cubic delete
that's be node load off lab

977
03:06:00,131 --> 03:06:03,693
now what I don't understand is when I run
the build script last time

978
03:06:04,398 --> 03:06:12,785
it seems to not like it at first and then
after that it was kind of okay makes me
wonder if there's something in there that's
not working

979
03:06:13,741 --> 03:06:15,817
give that a shot

980
03:06:16,933 --> 03:06:32,608
what are we doing case you just joined us
what kind of all over the board this is I
call this co-working cold learning we're
just all over everybody sharing news and we
learn about the run for desktop today and
but we are I am at work I'm trying to do
things for work

981
03:06:32,610 --> 03:06:49,893
are they able to actually take something and
somebody told us and report it to my work
and about renter to stop and it's crazy
value for that so it's called co-working
it's the same thing we would do if we were I
want a coffee shop or Panera Bread together
or French Bistro

982
03:06:52,005 --> 03:06:53,617
did I say that

983
03:06:58,258 --> 03:07:00,788
lvg you know me too well

984
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:06,758
you know it but I do my credits it wasn't my
fault

985
03:07:07,263 --> 03:07:18,041
ice nobody's fault it's a good thing right
it's pretty normal I forget about it

986
03:07:21,123 --> 03:07:30,221
up hey if there's like some hitch in
minikube where the it doesn't take the first
time and then the second time it does

987
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:37,413
I don't get it I like it's like I have some
left over from the previous one

988
03:07:37,506 --> 03:07:45,927
privyet in the peace that are still too
political.

989
03:07:46,522 --> 03:07:52,424
I wish we was just curious room kagaya

990
03:07:54,030 --> 03:07:58,571
about about about them Jessica's all right

991
03:07:59,390 --> 03:08:04,259
... Is it a scam

992
03:08:04,259 --> 03:08:13,651
no.

993
03:08:13,875 --> 03:08:16,030
Miss Rhonda

994
03:08:16,114 --> 03:08:30,416
needles liquor stores actual new at least
that your garage door to National Community
Middle School

995
03:08:30,417 --> 03:08:34,825
Cusco Peru whiskey community

996
03:08:35,895 --> 03:08:40,464
he actually means of s it really is well
said

997
03:08:40,594 --> 03:08:55,583
I'm honest honest honest honest sub shiver
if it's at the flower

998
03:08:55,584 --> 03:09:02,353
is Chill Vibes exit have a working four days
closer we do now

999
03:09:02,353 --> 03:09:09,130
so Jessica said she has two specific this is
Bulgaria Bulgaria

1000
03:09:09,130 --> 03:09:11,446
obsessed obsessed

1001
03:09:11,446 --> 03:09:53,031
suggest suggest I suggest this is a thing we
like Russian troops right so she just she
just is like is like society and saw a COS
like with so it means like with Society you
know you can like learn words with extra
Latin roots in Russian if you learn the
roots you can figure pretty much any word
out by learning The Roots down Jarvis's book
Russian Roots is hands-down the best way to
learn Russian because if you learn the
Russian routes you can sound out pretty much
any word you can figure it out even make up
words that are they do make sense of people
even if it doesn't exist

1002
03:09:53,036 --> 03:09:55,103
hey we got it we have an oh dear

1003
03:09:58,218 --> 03:10:04,551
08 MKS hsp90 test lab

1004
03:10:05,026 --> 03:10:09,861
damn it damn it

1005
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:18,842
profile list oh hey it's running

1006
03:10:18,842 --> 03:10:26,076
is running learning things I agree so CD

1007
03:10:26,077 --> 03:10:31,483
docker yes as soon as he is running

1008
03:10:31,484 --> 03:10:37,628
hey we just have the one controlling running
right now what the fuck uh-oh right because
you don't have that's kind yeah I have a
kind

1009
03:10:36,127 --> 03:10:39,762
yeah I have kind of clusters running out of
many composers running

1010
03:10:40,334 --> 03:10:46,051
let's go look at liver really quick because
you mind did

1011
03:10:46,664 --> 03:10:48,337
I'm back to liver

1012
03:10:51,808 --> 03:11:02,979
so here's a problem if I start using live
right now welcome everybody if I start
losing lovebird for everything instead of
the box then I don't and I don't have the
graphic thing I'm going to have to use a
command line for everything

1013
03:11:03,174 --> 03:11:15,321
which is that a bad thing right verse yes
yes yes either we go yeah I'll be glvc read
my mind

1014
03:11:15,499 --> 03:11:17,540
Catherine of fasteners

1015
03:11:21,597 --> 03:11:27,791
let me listen be real if you're going to
encounter virtual machines in the wild there
going to be KVM machines

1016
03:11:28,593 --> 03:11:31,723
prove me wrong prove me wrong

1017
03:11:34,082 --> 03:11:46,732
he's a virtual machine on the desktop for
graphic environment is going to run off
consumer-grade kind of thing has nothing to
do with him should you drink if you're going
to use a virtual machine in the wild and
chances are it's going to be liver to KVM

1018
03:11:47,880 --> 03:12:02,981
and that's what I was on yours is set for
there for learning live vert versus age
virtual manager and KVM and chemo is far
more relevant to becoming an infrastructure
engineer then learning average box

1019
03:12:03,252 --> 03:12:39,681
Richard boxes is in that you know let's
fight over I3 versus know I'm kind of thing
you know it's it's it's it's it's something
to talk about it's completely irrelevant for
getting worked on understanding how KVM
works is far more relevant and I think
that's what attracted me to it to 2 weeks
ago so I am happy you need boxes your family
it is it is it is but yeah but in this case
were not looking for user-friendly in this
case were looking for Enterprise you know
and I feel like

1020
03:12:40,483 --> 03:12:43,691
alright so let's

1021
03:12:43,833 --> 03:12:49,277
hey Nicks Nicks Nicks Nicks Nicks Nicks

1022
03:12:52,440 --> 03:12:56,350
anyway so many Q

1023
03:12:58,483 --> 03:13:05,935
MK SSH m k s a c h s p test

1024
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:09,841
all right list

1025
03:13:10,354 --> 03:13:20,711
okay profile smk I made my own newest thing
mksh to node

1026
03:13:20,711 --> 03:13:25,679
offline that's control my I come I can't go
to the control plane

1027
03:13:27,142 --> 03:13:32,216
oh my God aesthetic City MO

1028
03:13:33,585 --> 03:13:39,197
Roberta Superuser have a great day and see
if

1029
03:13:41,275 --> 03:13:48,576
oh I would not said we didn't switch the
profile oh my God I feel so silly you know I
took the music kind so much

1030
03:13:48,577 --> 03:13:51,892
yeah me to give us a lot more options

1031
03:13:55,995 --> 03:13:59,911
yay and it probably sent me to

1032
03:14:04,690 --> 03:14:07,662
look at me I know.

1033
03:14:08,198 --> 03:14:13,917
I think I think you could actually go to the
specific ones

1034
03:14:21,215 --> 03:14:27,941
how do you get ammo first console

1035
03:14:31,026 --> 03:14:38,011
I wish it holyshit like a full-blown console

1036
03:14:39,610 --> 03:14:42,902
oh my gerd

1037
03:14:42,903 --> 03:14:48,030
yeah Levert way liver is really the way I
mean List agree

1038
03:14:48,031 --> 03:14:53,342
it's just so much faster than it's much
faster

1039
03:14:56,298 --> 03:14:59,399
yeah yeah

1040
03:15:01,180 --> 03:15:07,130
you know what this means the right that the
whole day grinch it's going to have to
change over to deliver it again

1041
03:15:07,131 --> 03:15:17,575
yeah we did we got live at working with big
rent at the end at the end and then I
changed because I was like oh yeah but users
want to learn Universal boxes it's the way
in Vigor and has it and now I'm like on the

1042
03:15:16,153 --> 03:15:23,373
I know I'm like on the fence on the whole
thing again Baker is really the Tipping
Point you know it's kind of like

1043
03:15:24,332 --> 03:15:29,000
I think it's a 02 yeah that's what I wanted
to do

1044
03:15:30,825 --> 03:15:34,984
what's Escape it's this one I think that
again

1045
03:15:37,380 --> 03:15:40,804
everyone this is 01 or 02

1046
03:15:45,286 --> 03:15:46,415
yeah

1047
03:15:47,728 --> 03:15:53,492
oh if it doesn't support additional this how
am I going to do my volume test

1048
03:16:02,045 --> 03:16:04,628
that was the main thing

1049
03:16:07,817 --> 03:16:17,664
LBC you reminded me of the main reason that
was this single major driver for me to use
virtualbox to so I was doing the volume test
thing is because I can add up volume

1050
03:16:18,936 --> 03:16:26,251
you can't add a volume with the liver method
of vagrant that means either we throw
vagrant out

1051
03:16:26,776 --> 03:16:34,020
yeah it does weigh 230 vagrant out or yeah

1052
03:16:35,388 --> 03:16:40,366
we tried to reform and it fucking failed
miserably

1053
03:16:40,453 --> 03:16:49,233
enter form has a built-in virtual virtualbox
driver I don't know I apparently have to
know them both

1054
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:57,008
cell I don't know

1055
03:16:58,725 --> 03:17:06,056
and I don't know I don't know I can't think
that I'm going to lose my mind I will lose
my mind all right Kay dead

1056
03:17:07,135 --> 03:17:09,420
he getting those are they are

1057
03:17:13,463 --> 03:17:20,280
can't get no national wide what's the IP
wait what

1058
03:17:20,686 --> 03:17:24,036
I said they're in. I know that sometimes you
never mind

1059
03:17:27,023 --> 03:17:29,457
we've learned a ton yeah

1060
03:17:31,352 --> 03:17:35,479
write things down a DoTerra phone with
Levert

1061
03:17:38,155 --> 03:17:44,178
as I've said multiple times I would rather
learn terraform than vagrant

1062
03:17:44,449 --> 03:17:51,895
you get more money learning terraform then
you will learning vagrant you probably no
vagrants is rubbing on Ruby

1063
03:17:51,895 --> 03:17:57,796
in the movie Stripes with ansible yeah
that's what I like that's exactly what I
want to do

1064
03:17:57,796 --> 03:18:20,056
but I but I thought you couldn't use
terraform unless you had a cloud which means
you had to do proxmox that was a whole
conclusion if you if you can prove me wrong
on that oh my God I would love it I would
love to be wrong on that we Surfer music
what we try to do in case you're just
joining us we tried to not use old and
busted vagrant right we tried

1065
03:18:20,753 --> 03:18:28,290
lover traditional dis yeah but it's not as
easy as not like it's not like a single
lined

1066
03:18:28,764 --> 03:18:53,205
you couldn't give me a n e h n e h. 9 years
ago and I'm the six year old zip code is a
container orchestration framework primarily
used by the Enterprise if you don't know
what containers are it's kind of hard to
help you with that I might want to research
what are containers Taylor from has a liver
provider have you tried it yes I did

1067
03:18:53,207 --> 03:18:55,618
we tried the liver provider didn't work

1068
03:18:55,619 --> 03:19:05,004
no add some sort of like major problem it's
a really really old provider first of all is
used to support date is like really really
old

1069
03:19:06,318 --> 03:19:08,716
is it a single line

1070
03:19:08,716 --> 03:19:14,459
is it the disc line did they did they
support under experimental

1071
03:19:18,698 --> 03:19:26,251
Limerick stores this is new this is a
plug-in that's why yeah is a plug-in

1072
03:19:29,063 --> 03:19:32,925
yeah this is fantastic thank you for this

1073
03:19:34,989 --> 03:19:39,222
yeah the vagrant liver support was it was
not good

1074
03:19:39,222 --> 03:19:45,517
I'm telling you it was not good we had
problems with it I'm going to try to get no

1075
03:19:45,517 --> 03:19:52,769
I am willing to try it again yeah I am

1076
03:19:54,155 --> 03:19:57,273
yep no ways of it

1077
03:19:58,722 --> 03:20:05,356
I have to go add this to my notes because
you you're cuz you're making me you're
making me

1078
03:20:13,980 --> 03:20:19,391
I if you going to send me links I'm not
doing it we're not going to do it right now

1079
03:20:20,657 --> 03:20:22,320
will you do it later

1080
03:20:24,279 --> 03:20:53,541
do do watches like what the fuck I mean
let's let's let's go soft white or no for
safety and do what do the exercise we're
good to go we we are using KVM this time
there's just so many ways and so many
different virtualization options I'm really
sorry it's so confusing for beginners that's
just the way it is but you got to know all
the things these people were talking about
if you want to become an infrastructure as
you got to be able to weigh these choices
you know against each other in an Enterprise
scope

1081
03:20:54,006 --> 03:20:55,506
camera down

1082
03:20:57,021 --> 03:21:12,192
I-10 eventually until the weekend yes right
so yeah lots and lots of twelve-year-olds
get started actually at steelstacks so if
you don't know what to do or how to get
started go to this

1083
03:21:12,371 --> 03:21:17,344
and when it says to install Docker desktop
replace that with Rancher desktop

1084
03:21:18,317 --> 03:21:25,028
not go go for that that's that's the new my
new Boost instructions

1085
03:21:25,528 --> 03:21:29,204
as of today

1086
03:21:29,465 --> 03:21:48,636
cuz the shit is changing every fucking day I
don't know what people do who have like
curriculum that they've got solidified and
papers and books and shit like that how the
fuck are you supposed to keep up but won't
charge people for your up-to-date anise and
people do whether you're a boot camp or
college I don't see how they do it

1087
03:21:48,637 --> 03:22:22,708
this is a major major breakthrough and you
know nobody's even knows about it they will
cancel it even know about it for another 6
months to cancel know about it for six
months and then when they know that I do
have to consider where they're going to
change all their documents if he's going to
rewrite the docks and everything this is why
the Boost that I've been doing have always
been very loose and knew every single year
because you just it's just it's absolutely
new stuff and most of his verbal and I just
write an outline because if I had to write
it all down and won't do anything else

1088
03:22:22,712 --> 03:22:24,108
so

1089
03:22:24,422 --> 03:22:36,501
it's it's part of the it's part of the game
though and if you remind is spinning and I
called fuck I don't ever want to get into
this Indiana probably get to know because it
is you got to keep up is hard right so

1090
03:22:36,660 --> 03:23:11,486
now let's go ahead and do some appointments
right get notes so these are ordering. He's
can paint to look at 3 knows what's a note
to know what is I noticed a machine that is
running kubernetes stuff on it back we can
actually show you that we can do mksh and
this will take you on to the control plane
and we can actually SSH into the different
things here we can get your charger for
nodes and now I'm actually connected to a
Docker node

1091
03:23:11,489 --> 03:23:19,137
is the way life it is his lunch though and
so darker what is our darker password I do
not know

1092
03:23:19,728 --> 03:23:27,040
password password docker

1093
03:23:27,841 --> 03:23:30,676
I don't know what it is

1094
03:23:31,829 --> 03:23:36,033
someone look up what is the default

1095
03:23:36,171 --> 03:23:41,558
mini q no machine password

1096
03:23:43,125 --> 03:23:50,693
and password faster is username default
login is Docker password

1097
03:23:50,693 --> 03:23:54,211
TC user what the hell

1098
03:23:57,720 --> 03:24:01,229
I don't want to do that so there

1099
03:24:01,236 --> 03:24:07,840
I don't I'm going to emulate what I would
have to do an environment without Brewers
age that's why

1100
03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:09,457
I know

1101
03:24:09,457 --> 03:24:34,466
so it would only be SSH access from the
control planes into the nose that's how my
environment is right now you can't get to
the notes reservation once you get on a
control plane and I want to follow that
process just doesn't matter of course even
though I know I can cheat and used to go
straight at it so no offense sir but it's
that's what I'm doing here

1102
03:24:34,468 --> 03:24:40,167
and then I SSH into Jose k k Jose k k get
notes

1103
03:24:41,515 --> 03:24:43,962
k f c t l get nude

1104
03:24:47,278 --> 03:24:49,564
what do you mean there's no qvc2

1105
03:24:52,326 --> 03:24:58,874
can you see I'm going to have to I know I
know don't what don't worry you're the
hearts I do my extra large

1106
03:25:01,252 --> 03:25:09,086
and I love you this is all part of it so X4

1107
03:25:09,774 --> 03:25:11,718
cute fig

1108
03:25:14,087 --> 03:25:21,610
Etsy I know it's easier for her to say I
know I can hear you saying that I can hear
you saying it

1109
03:25:25,255 --> 03:25:33,243
there's not are you sure guess not

1110
03:25:35,663 --> 03:25:42,253
I just abscess themes guess not

1111
03:25:48,354 --> 03:25:50,467
what the fuck are these things

1112
03:25:58,489 --> 03:26:07,511
shitt I don't what kind of Destroyer is this
how do you identify the distro

1113
03:26:08,444 --> 03:26:14,441
motd that's what we used to do that's not it

1114
03:26:16,789 --> 03:26:19,195
Alice be released or some shit

1115
03:26:21,713 --> 03:26:29,127
I strip down Lennox I think it is actually I
just don't know what kind of wood it is

1116
03:26:32,001 --> 03:26:37,263
yeah yeah I tried your name

1117
03:26:40,217 --> 03:26:48,136
and I did not want to ask just go to Lenox
at the OS releases yes yes yes yes that's
the one I was looking for

1118
03:26:49,693 --> 03:26:56,241
building routes

1119
03:26:57,487 --> 03:27:01,040
name buildroot version dirty

1120
03:27:02,713 --> 03:27:06,229
this is a very unique they made their own
Lennox

1121
03:27:06,434 --> 03:27:16,626
yeah go Boston major in Linux so you can't
install anything on it forget that another
reason to use like

1122
03:27:16,933 --> 03:27:24,985
alavert sort of situation right I mean
another reason to use the vagrant using
liver is waking to be at we can actually
install stuff on there

1123
03:27:25,312 --> 03:27:27,920
yes

1124
03:27:29,197 --> 03:27:34,581
yeah you learn something everyday huh it was
eat its US release

1125
03:27:37,083 --> 03:27:40,483
I think you'll be under that yeah I can do
that

1126
03:27:40,835 --> 03:27:50,836
the guy over here now just just I have never
seen this before doctor run oh God there is
a doctor run shit

1127
03:27:50,949 --> 03:27:57,466
yeah because it has darker you can do all
that stuff that's so cheating as Sonics

1128
03:27:58,245 --> 03:28:09,485
I really don't need any of that stuff so the
world is your oyster absolutely

1129
03:28:10,904 --> 03:28:16,908
yeah yeah there is that's what I thought was
so weird II sources

1130
03:28:16,909 --> 03:28:24,896
ice I Source the admin thing do you keep CDL
I know it's got to be a cubit running over
here right

1131
03:28:28,595 --> 03:28:34,012
yeah there it is okay what

1132
03:28:35,836 --> 03:28:41,524
Entertainer yeah you could do that but this
is

1133
03:28:41,525 --> 03:28:45,749
as many as when you can have Mount options

1134
03:28:47,215 --> 03:28:55,148
I don't think make it hasn't as Mount
options yeah that

1135
03:28:55,391 --> 03:29:01,962
it is definitely a cutie instead of it
absolutely that's what they said they said
it was a committee instead of

1136
03:29:01,963 --> 03:29:07,105
so but there's no Cube ATM over here it just

1137
03:29:07,599 --> 03:29:15,476
are you just going to scroll down to see
what you see. I don't I don't need you that
because you know why I can do it from over
here

1138
03:29:16,417 --> 03:29:19,490
I canI can to keep Caesar from here so I'm
good

1139
03:29:20,406 --> 03:29:36,683
what I was trying to do was get on to the
endpoint so that I could see how many
containers of stuff we're running over there
I wanted to see how how real it is you know
and say yeah

1140
03:29:37,851 --> 03:29:39,787
I want to say

1141
03:29:41,122 --> 03:29:48,469
and it should give you a name with the notes
you don't it was built with you ATM but it
doesn't require Community shift with notes

1142
03:29:48,936 --> 03:29:59,163
most of the stuff that I've had his head
through those three things on it though he
will incubate him in Tuesday deal even
though it's not required just for the sake
of ministration right but it does make your
note heavier

1143
03:30:02,794 --> 03:30:09,463
yeah I know mksh will just get you on there
which girl and it actually has girl

1144
03:30:10,239 --> 03:30:13,778
again it's supposed to be tiny right so

1145
03:30:15,659 --> 03:30:20,200
I'm pretty sure I can assist age directly
into a box

1146
03:30:20,407 --> 03:30:25,872
yeah there it is there it is so I can assist
age Dash in

1147
03:30:29,283 --> 03:30:36,666
and I can do off test lab

1148
03:30:36,840 --> 03:30:44,199
is there a 1 what is it

1149
03:30:44,623 --> 03:30:51,110
manifest completion it does not it does not
have an equation

1150
03:30:51,688 --> 03:30:56,302
get nodes can get nodes

1151
03:30:58,094 --> 03:31:03,767
oh no. Flaps are you knowed all 50 states

1152
03:31:04,403 --> 03:31:07,439
so it's two and three you got to be kidding
me

1153
03:31:10,099 --> 03:32:01,776
I got to be there to go yeah thank you so
there we go we can go look at our container
I think this is enough I think this is
enough for sure but you only think this is
not working kind kind is not set up all your
outing for you got to do it on your own by
the big disadvantages of a kind of romantic
uneq gives you closer okay so kind gives you
like the ultimate in bare-bones nests and
uses doctor for everything mini Q gives you
gave me a man gives you the opportunity to
use a virtual machine which could you send
me the login too and it in a real way you
can still connect with kind into the systems
but they are not they don't have storage
devices and shit like that and you can
connect and then the other way would be
something like vagrant or terraform

1154
03:32:01,780 --> 03:32:14,185
and I would save up right before the big
rent in between there and then terraforming
the next level but we're going to run to try
really seriously to get terraform to work
locally with live bird and I think that that
would

1155
03:32:14,186 --> 03:32:15,965
love you much better

1156
03:32:17,299 --> 03:32:35,566
containers let me call the Elms absolutely
not people know this but some people might
not and you can do a lot of virtual machine
testing and development everything we just
containers and not use actually comes but
then you kind of need to step over he's
being what's wrong

1157
03:32:35,568 --> 03:33:03,509
or people. I think you're right I think
you're right especially people watching
right now yeah I didn't know your
differences important right has Paige it's
like it talks about the history of the
components communities and it's a really
great diagram of the top and it gives you
the history of you know traditional server
client architecture and then virtualization
and then containerization and how they've
all tried trade out some of the years I also
have a sale casting on the end

1158
03:33:03,512 --> 03:33:07,861
I wish I could find it KVM

1159
03:33:08,689 --> 03:33:14,246
I'm surprised now this is just how they do
things differently at Santa Rosa different
image

1160
03:33:14,246 --> 03:33:27,747
if sometime so we're good let's let's
actually get some shit running on no 2 by
doing an appointment this is what you came
here for if you if you dialed in for
discussing this is why you're here

1161
03:33:27,748 --> 03:33:31,669
if I do a.m. and

1162
03:33:31,669 --> 03:33:57,599
well drink right now with all the breaking
of the cleaner thing so we need to do some
stuff I put in bill this cuz I want some
place to store my commands not for any other
reason really just kind of messy again I
don't want to have to go back to my history
and find out I can but I just like to do
here in about two I'll put it in the
function of whatever so let's

1163
03:33:56,131 --> 03:34:01,684
so let's do this let's make a thing so so
cute t t l

1164
03:34:02,222 --> 03:34:17,234
let's just make an appointment the create
appointment fun it's one of the few things
you can make the command line there there
was a four or five things you can do for the
command line to create appointment without
any I will file other things you cannot do
that with

1165
03:34:19,083 --> 03:34:30,852
find us one of a nice whatever we want we
just going to put a bunch of shit in there
that's like really busy right we should put
this floor in there should be put it in
there

1166
03:34:31,290 --> 03:34:34,987
I mean we deployed it I could totally do
that

1167
03:34:35,525 --> 03:34:45,948
it's good she should create deployment image
or X Rob

1168
03:34:46,506 --> 03:34:54,288
it's just feel right what did I call I can
remember I think it's filled those yeah

1169
03:34:56,817 --> 03:34:58,474
Advil disc

1170
03:35:00,429 --> 03:35:06,597
so if we made this we made a container from
a French go container

1171
03:35:06,761 --> 03:35:12,609
yeah it doesn't feel it that much but let's
try that

1172
03:35:16,102 --> 03:35:22,405
so we got to go to name hahaha

1173
03:35:24,960 --> 03:35:29,191
I need to we're going to put a lot of shit
in there that's the whole point

1174
03:35:32,109 --> 03:35:34,465
I'm going to put a ton of shit in there

1175
03:35:37,817 --> 03:35:40,758
to make a milk container of filling disk

1176
03:35:42,046 --> 03:35:55,496
I don't know how much this kid has we can't
even check it you can't look at how much
just cuz on his system actually no we can
write we have to go to the underlying system
which sucks I hate this so SSH

1177
03:35:59,424 --> 03:36:18,212
got how can we even report on the disk
Yugioh zacian we can't we have to make
another thing for that Damon said the
reports on the disc has a Shinto the log I
know you can like do a thing right

1178
03:36:19,552 --> 03:36:27,191
I sent said I sent the application of
communities application coming at 10

1179
03:36:27,191 --> 03:36:32,074
come on are you all right

1180
03:36:32,074 --> 03:36:35,774
you can go lay down. Need you all right so

1181
03:36:36,406 --> 03:36:40,407
SSH mksh

1182
03:36:42,102 --> 03:36:59,520
I wonder if it does it just it's a
deployment so wait this is one of the only
have one that's already got it already over
from scratch on this dizzy boxer Alpine yeah
so I don't even know where is running okay
again pause that show wide

1183
03:36:59,666 --> 03:37:07,711
moo haha it's only winning one replica fuck
that we need to fix that

1184
03:37:08,026 --> 03:37:13,700
that's far too few we definitely need to
change this

1185
03:37:15,280 --> 03:37:23,023
damn it how can you represent like more than
one I'm going to do an actual appointment or
night I don't want to

1186
03:37:23,024 --> 03:37:25,640
QFC Seattle

1187
03:37:25,641 --> 03:37:31,711
create appointment I have to do they read
what you said

1188
03:37:32,978 --> 03:37:35,998
so this time tab

1189
03:37:35,998 --> 03:37:41,377
what is it is it rev I don't think I can do
a whole replica set stuff like that right

1190
03:37:41,378 --> 03:37:48,064
yeah now we can actually keep running it
like five of them

1191
03:37:49,811 --> 03:37:56,377
like this as soon as he has said why do we
doing this because we want separate jobs
right

1192
03:37:56,378 --> 03:37:59,989
yes

1193
03:37:59,989 --> 03:38:05,118
yes I don't know a skeleton planet that is
spelled the same container

1194
03:38:05,591 --> 03:38:09,615
picking up no neck sweater

1195
03:38:09,615 --> 03:38:16,976
for I in 1 to 20 I do

1196
03:38:16,976 --> 03:38:20,354
do this move haha I

1197
03:38:24,539 --> 03:38:28,913
done yes

1198
03:38:30,729 --> 03:38:34,094
here we go oh

1199
03:38:38,671 --> 03:38:49,571
as if it was in front of the bar then no no
no I don't think I put mine in my own local
mom-mom Ashton yeah most of the stuff you
put in your own thing

1200
03:38:50,410 --> 03:38:57,827
does a doctor have yeah which is bad I need
to tell me what tell me if I need to move on
soccer hub I do

1201
03:38:58,867 --> 03:39:04,850
and those are going to get slammed we want
them to get slammed that's the point

1202
03:39:05,718 --> 03:39:08,872
all right so nationalwide

1203
03:39:09,518 --> 03:39:16,777
and he at least it distributed it and it
includes the control plane I think I'm going
to get him

1204
03:39:18,466 --> 03:39:26,573
oh my God he told Tony fall we've been down
the ranch Odessa thing a whole day 369

1205
03:39:27,379 --> 03:39:37,904
Anton wait how do we have that many nodes
out of this is the internal IP cuz pods have
their own IP

1206
03:39:38,358 --> 03:39:44,332
do there we go

1207
03:39:45,856 --> 03:39:51,919
is anybody ever remember actually watching
The Three Stooges on television

1208
03:39:53,802 --> 03:39:55,335
cuz I do

1209
03:39:56,717 --> 03:40:02,581
the Virginia Lottery what is it still works
my fan is on right now

1210
03:40:02,825 --> 03:40:05,935
my fan is definitely on right now

1211
03:40:10,522 --> 03:40:16,720
all right Eagles Boomer I know I know

1212
03:40:16,721 --> 03:40:23,016

1213
03:40:25,315 --> 03:40:27,446
thank and gaming

1214
03:40:27,520 --> 03:40:34,724
when I supposed to meant I haven't switch
yet I have not switched if I probably not
probably in the switch to Mac

1215
03:40:35,245 --> 03:40:37,330
did I see what I did there

1216
03:40:39,761 --> 03:40:47,585
holy shit this is like blowing my my stuff
up I get my mind computer is not happy right
now

1217
03:40:47,897 --> 03:40:51,162
you see what I mean I already got happier

1218
03:40:51,990 --> 03:41:04,895
still is pretty fucking every one of those
every way I can top Santilli every one of
these things is spitting out as fast as it
can

1219
03:41:04,896 --> 03:41:10,023
I can't believe is this doing that well holy
cow

1220
03:41:12,315 --> 03:41:18,878
well I don't even what that means yeah I
still can have them or

1221
03:41:19,298 --> 03:41:24,996
I know yeah

1222
03:41:26,645 --> 03:41:32,023
I can't believe it's handling it I thought
it would kill me I might still streaming

1223
03:41:32,145 --> 03:41:38,460
it says I'm still streaming 48 till is 300
km per second 5000 K per second

1224
03:41:39,863 --> 03:41:44,955
I know it's sink is I'm not going to run
sink fuck no

1225
03:41:45,820 --> 03:41:54,804
and that's what you meant by Sync okay why
would I sink during the middle of a run like
this look at all these look at these live
birds around and see this

1226
03:41:55,293 --> 03:42:03,023
Albie's key moose am I used to swap I
haven't slept all night

1227
03:42:04,437 --> 03:42:10,441
I hope sheds my swap is getting tags

1228
03:42:10,441 --> 03:42:18,011
should I try to turn swap off I have so I
can swap off and watch it fucking die

1229
03:42:19,918 --> 03:42:26,467
it was freezing a computer it would totally
freeze my computer

1230
03:42:26,686 --> 03:42:28,932
I don't think it would

1231
03:42:28,954 --> 03:42:37,867
I know what I'm blowing up my machine and
purpose but this is kind of fun how do we do
our tanks and Toleration should

1232
03:42:38,583 --> 03:42:43,991

positions

1240
04:16:31,516 --> 04:16:41,804
and they're asking me questions about what
what should we look for who we who do we
need when we doing things I'm going to say
it again if you have

1241
04:16:42,559 --> 04:16:47,789
if you have a kubernetes cluster that you
are running at home

1242
04:16:48,636 --> 04:16:50,759
and you set up yourself

1243
04:16:52,546 --> 04:17:12,469
askew

1244
04:17:13,524 --> 04:17:19,918
if you fuc so

1245
04:17:20,698 --> 04:17:27,179
I was going to say it if if you have a non
Prime committee's closer that you administer
yourself

1246
04:17:27,515 --> 04:17:47,422
and you can talk about intelligently and you
know all the pieces and even better if you
have some knowledge of how to read go and
some knowledge about basic networking
infrastructure engineering and you want a
job that's going to be like above what I do

1247
04:17:47,671 --> 04:17:55,662
I know they're all hired we cannot find
anybody been a year-and-a-half and can't
find him I tell you what those people

1248
04:17:55,884 --> 04:18:01,419
those people are writing their own fucking
ticket right now manbe there there go

1249
04:18:01,917 --> 04:18:11,992
they're they're actually talking about going
back to the client and and saying you need
to give us another 100K because they can't
get people for the price that they're asking
for

1250
04:18:12,545 --> 04:18:32,951
and you know I don't want to talk about much
I make but the amount of money that I
already make is crazy I mean it's crazy to
me how much should I know it's not crazy to
the people work in Silicon Valley it's like
free racing pretty reasonable but I'm just
trying to say there is work out there for
those who want it

1251
04:18:34,014 --> 04:18:35,827
you're never he stills

1252
04:18:36,197 --> 04:18:55,884
so this is really great that's why I talked
to a recruiter so long ride because when I
talked to a recruiter and they're trying to
say hey how can we they just they put a
couple people in front of my employer or
contractor write it put a couple people and
they got turn down you know when I get
turned down because they were too much into
the cloud

1253
04:18:55,935 --> 04:19:00,508
not getting you I am so glad that I'm
focusing on on friend

1254
04:19:00,663 --> 04:19:09,311
are there is there something that I realized
it from that conversation I really want to
write about this probably should write as I
do about this

1255
04:19:10,094 --> 04:19:43,333
I first Linux admin job while you're on your
way you're on your way and don't under
understand you know keep learning repeating
what Leon says here you got to getting the
job is just the first step then you got it
you know keep learning and develop yourself
when you got in of the pressure's off right
so you got to keep doing it it's also kind
of on at the same time because you know you
got a massive imposter syndrome when you
first get hired everybody does
infrastructure engineering and specifically
cloud-native anything with cloud-native in
the name

1256
04:19:43,338 --> 04:20:07,186
Cloud native is the key word to search for
not that mops search for cloud native and
search for kubernetes and search for on-prem
okay and that they interviewed and I should
probably put this in a video the person that
they interviewed that they decided not to go
with with somebody who had a lot of cloud
experience and was just barely getting into
on from

1257
04:20:07,190 --> 04:20:13,011
and I believe I have enough of ejected
evidence at this point to say

1258
04:20:13,012 --> 04:20:16,462
learning how to run your own

1259
04:20:16,783 --> 04:20:28,979
no you don't need to search I don't think
you do know they I did they would hire
people without the store tents down the
position of trying to fill the guy had no
service at all ever never in them

1260
04:20:28,981 --> 04:21:06,522
and I've I've talked to other hiring
managers in this chat who have said I'll
take somebody with a non Prime cluster that
they've built and maintained and can talk
about it intelligently way more than I'll
take some of the cert desserts are not going
to hurt in this case right they're not going
to hurt they're not going to admit this is
specifically I'm going to give you a bit of
information that it's not classified but
it's I think it's very valuable the specific
feedback for this experience Cloud engineer
who was turned down by this job was that
they had too much glad experience not enough
on from experience

1261
04:21:06,526 --> 04:22:07,165
add they did not have him answer Jimmy they
did not have they were looking specifically
for people who had Advanced our back roll
for Missions experience and we're dealing
with multi-tenant multi cluster
interactivity and they can make you know not
just one not two but three they can have and
make a deal with multiple clusters for
different needs and set up different
permissions and be able to cousin to get to
communicate with one another that was this
specific reason this engineer was turned
down that and probably other other issues I
don't know but that was the main issue and I
that's a very choice piece of information
and I got that because I've maintained a
really positive relationship with my
recruiter my recruiter regarding calls me
and I said it before if you want to get a
job and keep a job it's about making
personal connections and I know about this
recruiter through a person that I met on
this live stream so

1262
04:22:07,171 --> 04:22:24,682
getting a job and keeping a job is about
it's about the human connection about
everything else but you know that is I would
have paid money to have that feedback I
seriously I would have paid good money to
have heard that recruiter give me the
feedback about why the candidate didn't make
it

1263
04:22:24,684 --> 04:22:27,186
because now I can share that with you

1264
04:22:29,509 --> 04:22:40,946
on-prem multi-cloud so actually because
based on that in put this is what I want to
do they still hadn't put I want to do this
already but I am going to make

1265
04:22:39,572 --> 04:22:43,251
but I am going to make multiple clouds at
home

1266
04:22:43,577 --> 04:23:38,834
and have them talk to each other separate
and I'm going to use terraform to do it
their all the virtualization on a proxmox
think that's I'm definitely going to make
that before the end of the year because then
what you do is you can like you can
reprovision multiple Cloud you can have your
say I want to put a customer here comes over
here and then you can test them all out you
don't homelab and yes you're going to pay
for latency and and virtualization not 30%
performance but who cares you're going to be
able to test it all in multiple different
configurations you should have it if you
really want to work in this job if you
really want to work and it's on on this
cloud-native job I don't think I've ever
felt more strongly you need a home lab with
multiple multiple cores were talking like
you know total of like I'm probably 20 to 40
Kors total you know and that's combined of
course across machines

1267
04:23:38,841 --> 04:23:50,157
and be able to do all the stuff and then we
connected with Submariner you do this is
multiple different on Prime Claws and then
connecting with Submariner yeah somebody was
telling me about something or the other day
was it you

1268
04:23:50,203 --> 04:23:51,432
yeah

1269
04:23:51,968 --> 04:24:46,977
yeah see it in that that that that kind of
experience is what people you know people we
should listen to it to Porsche and we're
just got a different architectural slant
then some of the other people in the channel
which is great we have got really seen your
people here who have deployed very complex
cloud-native on friend things and have
different opinions about how to do that we
have some you know openshift people we have
some some people who have done nothing but
Rancher I think forces Rancher and we have
people that you know they just all sorts of
different opinions on that on that level so
we have some great exposure here to teach it
to doing this and of course my goal is to
create the best possible home simulation lab
to explore any of those possibilities so
that you can play around with hey I want to
I want to this weekend I'll say Christmas
break I'm going to shift everything over the
open shift

1270
04:24:46,982 --> 04:25:36,044
I'm just going to play the open shift for
the whole Christmas to you know and then I'm
going to see if everything back over here
and I'm going to get a sense of all of them
and then it every time you do that you can
put stuff on your CV and erasing me that
says you've worked with it even if it's your
own experimental lab it totally counts as a
project and you can list and then when you
go to do the job interview you can say you
say they said they will tell us what you've
done is it while I made my own I maintain my
own you know 15 old live at home like how do
you do that was something that we can figure
it to do the X and Y and Z I'm not doing
that right now that's my goal right that's
my goal to be able to do that but I think be
able to celebrate and if some of that stuff
is GPU if you're doing GPU machine learning
jobs on top of that you fucking golden
because a lot of these on private places
there doing why are they doing on Prem
they're going to prom because you choose
expensive they want to rent it

1271
04:25:36,049 --> 04:25:50,325
didn't want to rent cheap you so they go on
friend with her closer to do machine
learning and now if you know how to do
machine learning which means you know how to
do you know when it is installed in in video
provisioning and stuff like that you need to
build it up

1272
04:25:50,706 --> 04:26:00,900
getting a hacker rank with me could
questions a red flag absolutely to me it is
as long as you level a skin test me on there
yeah I know I don't want nothing to do with
it

1273
04:26:00,900 --> 04:26:53,771
at the dead man we talked about that quite a
bit and I it's one of my biggest pet peeves
if a company doesn't they just look the
other way it's keep walking has
overwhelmingly convince me of that fact if
you if you want to go for a senior software
engineering job like where you're actually
doing you know computer science level
algorithms and coding and stuff like that
that's a totally different job than the job
that I'm preparing people for it might play
into that everything I'm doing is rep rep
for that if you as well if you want some of
it might be you know rabbit holes compared
to what you really need to focus on their
ask you to meet code is a different job than
the stuff that I'm helping people get lines
primary operations and and then they asked
me what scripting skills do you think they
should have I said issues with Bosch Python
and not a real pearl and Ruby and they
should be able to Rigo

1274
04:26:53,777 --> 04:27:16,482
imma stand up and walk away and go eat some
food and I'll be back again I'm not going to
drop the screen though it's just it's just
inconvenient for you to get so we're going
to my fan is still on so how is my computer
doing as my disc filled yet

1275
04:27:17,223 --> 04:27:20,952
here's the really cool thing my disk is not
going to feel because why

1276
04:27:19,782 --> 04:27:27,232
not going to feel because why cuz it's only
going to fill my individual volumes the
swamp is full of God

1277
04:27:28,126 --> 04:27:35,756
should I get rid of swap should I get rid of
swamp you dare me to

1278
04:27:38,029 --> 04:27:43,754
should I swap off it yeah

1279
04:27:44,827 --> 04:27:49,074
when is it worth swapping assistant is
approximately right

1280
04:27:51,371 --> 04:27:59,193
I can't remember swappiness is let him
Killer do its job that's that's what I want
to do yeah

1281
04:28:00,503 --> 04:28:07,611
I do want to do it's it's it's keeping up a
bunch of stuff that I've been a member yeah

1282
04:28:07,706 --> 04:28:13,238
it definitely is Aaron, this is not a real
thing

1283
04:28:14,058 --> 04:28:20,512
wait we we do those notes have small for
them they should not have some off on them
they shouldn't

1284
04:28:21,024 --> 04:28:23,015
if they do

1285
04:28:28,648 --> 04:28:33,778
Anaheim swap good night then I was off

1286
04:28:37,543 --> 04:28:42,670
2 GB so they're managing pretty well I think
it's funny though that

1287
04:28:44,443 --> 04:28:48,007
what swapping is mini Q the one swapping
who's swapping

1288
04:28:52,460 --> 04:28:59,865
yeah it is an HR hiring thing yeah

1289
04:29:00,961 --> 04:29:11,795
people get around the HR situation by
meeting human beings there in the job
already like me like recruiters like people
at conferences

1290
04:29:12,182 --> 04:29:18,988
is it Prague sloppiness I can't remember
where it was thank you well if I can't have
any cuz there's no swap

1291
04:29:20,511 --> 04:29:26,985
yeah I left my swap on a piss cuz I'm
streaming I don't know if I turn it off on
here

1292
04:29:27,430 --> 04:29:32,586
I remember changing this once upon a time
though so yeah

1293
04:29:44,577 --> 04:29:52,049
yeah I sent it to 10 while back that's in my
that's that's in my my bass or c

1294
04:29:52,113 --> 04:29:57,393
some place I can't remember where add to my
health at sunrise

1295
04:29:58,472 --> 04:30:09,645
I need to get from you I'm going to class I
might collapse anyway what time is it 6
already

1296
04:30:13,068 --> 04:30:14,779
shit

1297

I don't know how

1298
04:30:23,335 --> 04:30:33,562
five parts of a lame jokes for the win

1299
