# Use FreeIPA for DNS, PAM, Directory, and More

Discovered the FreeIPA project. At first I was really excited,
then I started to realize that it is a monolith. It bundles a bunch of
stuff together, including DNS, and LDAP/Kerberos. Then I remembered how
much I fucking hate Kerberos and how un-Unix-like the entire approach
is. I would rather manage the individual components individually.
