# Rode Smartlav+ is Shit, Even Compared to Rode Lav

Did a sound check today and was completely surprised to discover that
the TRRS Smartlav+ has noticeably poor performance compared to the TRS mic,
which doesn't make any sense. I used a USB TRS splitter for the TRS and
a USB TRRS adapter for the other. It could be the adapter that is the
problem. I really don't care. I'm keeping the USB slip adapter because I
can use my Ars-Technica monitor headphones with it. I'll call it my
*wind kit* since in high-wind conditions I just have to plug it into the
USB and restart the stream (unfortunately).
