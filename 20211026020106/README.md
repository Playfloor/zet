# Current AMA Questions

* Q: Should I use default TMUX key bindings?
* Q: How do you know you're having a burnout?
* Q: I am enrolled in a 4 month Full-Time Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Vancouver. By the end of the bootcamp I would have had exposure to the PERN stack and Ruby on Rails. What should I focus on the most after bootcamp to help me get my first job as a web developer? (e.g., side projects, reading Cracking the Coding Interview, etc.)
