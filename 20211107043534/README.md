# Everything Wrong with GoPro for IRL in 10 Minutes

ðŸ“º <https://youtu.be/PvH3aPC_Lfg>

1. Miekii used GoPro *wait for it* 7
1. Eventually the 7 will go away
1. You *must* get the Media Mod
1. Cannot replace the windscreen
1. Must remove the entire Media Mod to replace battery
1. Windsceen is off center even though stereo
1. Cables won't clear most of the accessory mounts (harness, headstrap)
1. Horrible battery life with live pushing with Bluetooth
1. Absolutely buggy and broken "Quik" app
1. Lack of bitrate toggles and limits
1. No SRT support

I'm going to do what everyone has always said, try the Sony x3000 and
see just how waterproof I can make it so that I can run in any
conditions with it.
