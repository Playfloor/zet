# Colearning Cloud-Native and Kubernetes (Fridays 12-3pm)

Updated: 20220603161828

I've decided that I need some structure to my own preparation for the
CKAD, CKA, and CKS certifications that I have until July 2022 to
complete. So I'm going to schedule prep for them on Fridays 12-3pm
(which is okayed by my employer as well). If you'd like to join in
please come on in. Even if you have a lot of experience, we'd love to
have you chime in and correct our mistakes as we go.

There is no structure to our preparation other than the curriculum
provided by the Cloud Native foundation. Things will vary from week to
week depending any number of factors.

> ⚠️
> This is *not* directed learning, it is free-form experimentation. If

A few things to note:

* Streaming to Twitch only, VODs saved to YouTube with notes
* Prioritize CKAD -> CKA -> CKS
* Definitely will include mistakes and fails
* We do have a Google calendar (https://bit.ly/rwxrobsched)
* Check with your company, might have time allocated
* If you have questions, just ask
* Will use kind, minikube, and kubeadm (mostly)
* Primarily use resource available on cert exams
* Use only tools and techniques available during exam
* Assume certification has merit (in my case)

Getting Started:

* Follow documentation on <https://kubernetes.io>
* Recommend VirtualBox "Driver" for Minikube
