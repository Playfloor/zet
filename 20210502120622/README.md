# Rob's Personal Code of Conduct

I know I fail miserably to keep it. But having it written down helps me
remember. Often I have to repeat these to myself over and over again to
help remember in the heat of the moment. Obviously, this is not an
exhaustive list, but it sure helps. Sometimes I will tweak it.

0.  Ask
1.  Run
1.  Yoga
1.  Chill
2.  Dance
3.  Create
4.  Forgive
1.  Consider
5.  Never fear
6.  Be grateful
7.  Use a filter
8.  Swear better
9.  Make it count
10. Foster dialog
11. Live with less
12. Show and share
13. Let people change
14. Build useful things
15. Don’t get mad, get busy
16. Read the fucking manual
19. “What if everybody did it?”
17. Give the benefit of the doubt
18. Remind your body you are human

When I find myself doing the following I know I'm on the path to evil:

* Fear
* Chase the likes
* Teach and preach
* Assume malintent
* Sugar the learning
* Build clever things
* Wonder what people think of me
* Ask, "What can I get away with?"
