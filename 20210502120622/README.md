# Rob's Personal Code of Conduct

I know I fail miserably to keep it. But having it written down helps me
remember. Often I have to repeat these to myself over and over again to
help remember in the heat of the moment. Obviously, this is not an
exhaustive list, but it sure helps. Sometimes I will tweak it.

* Run
* Chill
* Dance
* Create
* Never fear
* Be grateful
* Swear better
* Foster dialog
* Live with less
* Show and share
* Let people change
* Build useful things
* Read the fucking manual
* Don't get mad, get busy 
* Remind your body you're human
* Give the benefit of the doubt
* Ask "What if everybody did it?"

When I find myself doing the following I know I'm on the path to evil:

* Fear
* Chase the likes
* Teach and preach
* Assume malintent
* Sugar the learning
* Build clever things
* Wonder what people think of me
* Ask, "What can I get away with?"
