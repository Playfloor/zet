# Using Vault Instead of Keycloak

All I had to read was that Vault is written in Go 1.17 from Hashicorp
and Keycloak is an ancient Java application from a company that was
acquired by RedHat to make my decision about an IAM provider for my home
lab. At work we are on Keycloak now, but planning on migrating off to
Vault eventually. So might as well get a jump on it.
