# Twitch VODs On Minus Music

I've added back Twitch VODs now that it is just so incredibly easy to
isolate what sound gets sent. All you have to do is make sure you have
the latest OBS and click on *Enable Advanced Encoder Settings* and
*Twitch VOD Track (Uses Track 2)* and then uncheck *Track 2* in any
sound source you don't want to be sent to Twitch. At first just
unchecking all of *Desktop Audio* got me started, but I hope to add a
new virtual audio device so that I can isolate just Spotify (and other
applications) so that my clips, for example, will still work.

By the way, I read that Twitch is brokering a deal that will remove all
DCMA take-downs from anything on Twitch that they have been working on
for years. If that does in fact happen, it will be a monumental change
to the entire entertainment industry rocketing Twitch past YouTube as
the most important personal broadcasting service.
