# Use Skopeo for Moving Container Images Around

Recently, I was told about Skopeo, a useful tool for moving images
between registries --- particularly when moving from the Internet into a
private enterprise repository in Harbor or Portus of something. It's yet
another tool that isn't included in the list when people start getting
into Kubernetes, and more proof that just learning Kubernetes is never
enough. In fact, it's all the different tools that fulfill Kubernetes
and supplement it that are the real things anyone needs to learn.
