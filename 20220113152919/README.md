# Optimal Sound Levels for Streaming

After two years of making videos and streaming, and having others
confirm my conclusions, here are the best sound volume levels for
everything on my PopOS system with the sound mixer board plugged into
the front microphone jack (and receiving from the front headphone jack):

* Voice and desktop effects and video in the -13 to -2 (yellow) range
* Music hovering around -28 (less can't hear, more people complain)
