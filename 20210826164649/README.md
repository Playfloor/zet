# Moods, Modes, and States of Being

These will change over time. But hopefully this will help people keep up
with what's going on with <http://rwxrob.tv>. I've arranged things in
the order of interactivity and attentiveness.

üêü **Away** The fishies screensaver is on and I'm no where near the
computer (usually). This is not the same as stepping away for a few
minutes to take a break like I do with other modes. It means I likely
won't be back for a long time. (Most of the time I'm asleep, on a date,
or outside running, see rwxrob.live eventually for IRL stream.) People
stay in the chat just as a hang-out, usually using an IRC client somehow
(see Twitch Without the Twitch). You can leave a question for me with a
`Q:` at the beginning of it and I'll see them later. Always music,
usually Meditative, Beach, or Chillhop. Categories: Science &
Technology.

üè¢ **Working** I'm mostly away or off screen a lot doing other stuff to
make money a living, the "day job" if you prefer. I am really glad I
have a job as an Infrastructure and Cloud-Native Engineer (who also does
Software Development) because it makes me have more relevant things to
say to people working in the same field or trying to get into it. Making
money full-time always ensures as best I can that my cognitive biases
are not driven by shilling you something for a high-paying sponsor. My
opinions are real, my own, and usually born from research and experience
(but not always). Chat away but there will only be music and chat.

‚òï **Focusing** I'm ignoring pretty much everything, usually drinking
coffee, and getting into flow state. No camera. No mic. Some chat during
short breaks. Always music (which is more likely to be industrial than
at any other time). Come code and work with me on your own projects
while I work on mine. You are welcome to chat and ask questions. Someone
else might answer you. I just might not see them. You are not bothering
me. Categories: Science & Technology, Software and Game Development,
Writing.

üïπÔ∏è  **Gaming** I'm playing a video game of some kind. I love to randomly
chat while playing games. Usually camera and mic are on but I'm paying
varying amounts of attention to the chat. Always music. Categories: Dota
2, Witcher 3, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, ShenzenIO.

üí¨ **Chatting** The main point of this mode is engagement with the chat.
I'm actively engaging with people from all chat sources both in text and
voice. Sometimes I have video on as well. During this mode *you* are the
priority above everything else, be it AMA or otherwise. Feel free to
throw your own ideas and opinions and questions out for us to discuss.
Camera and mic vary. Usually there is music. Categories: Just Chatting,
Science & Technology, Software and Game Development.

üéâ **Partying** Usually this means I have music on and am just
celebrating and being happy with y'all.


ü§¨ **Ranting** I'm pissed off and using the word "fuck" a lot. You've
been warned.

üé¨ **Recording** I'm recording what is happening on the screen to be
placed into a video saved forever on YouTube. Be careful what you chat.
Use the octothorpe (hashtag, `#`) if you don't want your chat readable
on screen.
