# Moods, Modes, and States of Being

These will change over time. But hopefully this will help people keep up
with what's going on with <http://rwxrob.tv>. I've arranged things in
the order of interactivity and attentiveness.

You can usually ask questions anytime. Depending on what I'm doing I'll
answer them right away, or later. Begin them with a Q: to help them
stand out. Post them to Discord `#ama` to have them get long answers.

🐟 **Away** The fishies screensaver is on and I'm no where near the computer (usually). This is not the same as stepping away for a few minutes to take a break like I do with other modes. It means I likely won't be back for a long time. (Most of the time I'm asleep, on a date, or outside running, see rwxrob.live eventually for IRL stream.) People stay in the chat just as a hang-out, usually using an IRC client somehow (see Twitch Without the Twitch). You can leave a question for me with a Q: at the beginning of it and I'll see them later. Always music, usually Meditative, Beach, or Chillhop. Categories: Science & Technology.

🏢 **Coworking** I'm mostly away or off screen a lot doing other stuff for a living at the day job. If I can stream work I do the work on stream. I am really glad I have a job as an Infrastructure and Cloud-Native Engineer (who also does Software Development) because it makes me have more relevant things to say to people working in the same field or trying to get into it. Making money full-time always ensures as best I can that my cognitive biases are not driven by shilling you something for a high-paying sponsor. My opinions are real, my own, and usually born from research and experience (but not always). Chat away but there will only be music and chat. Categories: Science & Technology, Software and Game Development.

☕ **Focusing** I'm ignoring pretty much everything, usually drinking coffee, and getting into flow state. No camera. No mic. Some chat during short breaks. Always music (which is more likely to be industrial than at any other time). Come code and work with me on your own projects while I work on mine. You are welcome to chat and ask questions. Someone else might answer you. I just might not see them. You are not bothering me. Categories: Science & Technology, Software and Game Development, Just Chatting.

🕹️  **Gaming** I'm playing a video game of some kind. I love to randomly chat while playing games. Usually camera and mic are on but I'm paying varying amounts of attention to the chat. Always music. Categories: Dota 2, Witcher 3, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, ShenzenIO.

🤬 **Ranting** I'm pissed off and using the word "fuck" a lot. I'm usually not listening to anyone and just want to yell loudly. *Usually,* this mode doesn't stay very long but I make no promises. If there is music I can't hear it over the sound of my own angry, "unhinged" voice. Categories: Just Chatting, Science & Technology, Talk Shows & Podcasts.

🎬 **Recording** I'm recording what is happening on the screen to be placed into a video saved forever on YouTube. The title will be the same title of the YouTube video that gets posted. I use my zet cast tool to synchronize the notes with the description of the video. I almost always keep the live chat off the screen for obvious (but hard-learned) reasons. Be careful what you chat. Use the octothorpe (hashtag) as the first character if you don't want your chat readable on screen. (You'll have to add an initial space if you want to enter an actual tag.)

👟 **Exercise** Doing something for my fitness level. Don't bother tuning in if you don't want to see and hear an old man gasping for breath IRL and laughing off old age by staying as fit as I can.

🎉 **Partying** Usually this means I have music on and am just celebrating and being silly. I might even break out the guitar or have my wife on. Might be doing my own take on movies. Might be drunk and dancing. Sometimes watching other streamers. If I'm not engaging the chat it's because I'm distracted by something shiny. You are my priority for sure (so long as you are entertaining me). Music is always blasting and I take requests for whatever. Categories: Just Chatting, Science & Technology, Music, Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll (It's a joke Twitch TOS people, calm the fuck down.)

💬 **Chatting** The main point of this mode is engagement. I'm actively engaging with any and all chat sources as best I can both in text and voice. I change the title up a lot to try and match the ever-changing topic and theme (but fail miserably). Sometimes I have video on as well. During this mode *you* are the priority above everything else, be it AMA or otherwise. Feel free to throw your own ideas and opinions and questions out for us to discuss. Camera and mic vary. Usually there is music. Categories: Just Chatting, Science & Technology, Software and Game Development, Talk Shows & Podcasts.

☎️ **Answering** Taking live voice calls in Discord. Could be about anything or could be topical depending on what's happening. Just go into the TALK \#lobby where you can chat and post your text question for submission live. I'll drag you into the private live channel where we can talk on stream.
