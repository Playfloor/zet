# Moods, Modes, and States of Being

These will change over time. But hopefully this will help people keep up
with what's going on with <http://rwxrob.tv>. I've arranged things in
the order of interactivity and attentiveness.

You can usually ask questions anytime. Depending on what I'm doing I'll
answer them right away, or later. Begin them with a Q: to help them
stand out. Post them to Discord `#ama` to have them get long answers.
