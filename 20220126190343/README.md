# Rancher Desktop Alternative to Docker Desktop

Rancher Desktop 1.0 was just announced just in time to help large
companies deal with the looming deadline to start paying for their
corporate subscriptions to Docker Desktop (Enterprise). This is huge.
All the alternatives so far have not fulfilling the same expectation for
a drop-dead simple user-friendly interfaces to Docker. Looks like this
one does with the added bonus of providing a local Kubernetes cluster
out of the box (instead of tacking it on like Docker Desktop tried, and
failed, to do). This is huge news for those making enterprise decisions
about container tooling for their developers.

It also turns out that Rancher Desktop supports M1 Macs (while
VirtualBox still does not).
