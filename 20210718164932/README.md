# Boost Badges Make Easier Learning Adventures

Just realizing that by adding individual badges for the different
things in the different boosts that I can create learning adventures and
technical geocaches and treasure hunts that apply specifically to a
badge (as opposed to a concept or something more wordy). Hopefully, this
will let people cognitively grab on to what they are learning in a way
that provides visual context and ultimately motivation to gotta get them
all.
