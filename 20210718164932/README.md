# Boost Badges Make Easier Learning Adventures

Just realizing that by adding individual badges for the different
things in the different boosts that I can create learning adventures and
technical geocaches and treasure hunts that apply specifically to a
badge (as opposed to a concept or something more wordy).

Once again, the similarity to Scouting merit badges comes out. With
merit badges people would organize camps and workshops and other fun
ways to earn the badge in addition to the normal individual method that
anyone can always do themselves.

Hopefully, this will let people cognitively grab on to what they are
learning in a way that provides visual context and ultimately motivation
to gotta get them all.
