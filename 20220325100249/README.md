# Use USENET, Reddit for Boomers, But Better

Still amazed how few people actually know about USENET and UUCP
newsgroups these days. The most important communication involving the
most important technologies of our time is still taking place there.
These days most use the Google monopolistic interface to them, and
that's fine.
