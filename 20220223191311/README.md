# Friendly Reminder, Apache-2 Requires Attribution

I'm seeing people creating things based on my most substantial FOSS
contributions without providing a single line of attribution. This
fucking pisses me off. I put in 1000s of hours and I don't even get a
mention in someone else's project that clearly rips off exactly what I
innovated in my approach. No wonder they were so eager to register
groups and squat on my project names early on.

So much for being nice. If people keep doing this shit and not
responding to my polite issue requests I'm hiring a fucking lawyer. How
much of a dick are you to not even give a mention? If you are that
desperate to plaster your "maintainer" name all over *my* work in your
derivative stuff I'm not working with you ever again.
