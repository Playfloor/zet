# Weekly Streaming Schedule

<https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule>

Here's my attempt to keep a weekly schedule updated. Keep in mind that
although these maybe *regular* they are not guaranteed, and, in fact,
are often moved or cancelled due to life. I also do a lot of other
streaming that isn't listed here because I don't always know in advance
if I can. I do, however, always post my schedule to
<https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule> (and only there). I figured having
something to watch might help keep up with my frequent changes. 

Time|Topic
:-:|:-:
Tuesday 6-9pm   | Beginner Boost AMA
Friday 12-3pm   | Colearning Cloud-Native and Kubernetes
Saturday 8-11am | Go Programming (My Own Stuff)
Sunday 8-11am   | Writing Boost and Other Content

**Beginner Boost AMA** is a free time that will be recorded and saved to
YouTube as a live session as-is (no editing). You can ask anything that
is about or contained in any of the Beginner Boost content. I normally
have both mic and camera on for it.

**Colearning Cloud-Native and Kubernetes** is a personal learning stream
where I just study the stuff I need for certification in CKAD, CKA, and
CKS, which I hope to complete by July 2022. Join to study with me, to
help me, or to just laugh at my cloud-native noob-ness. I have no
problem the mistakes and fails and learning opportunities I have had
along the way. (I'm currently employed as an Infrastructure Engineer
working with an HPC cluster and deploying applications like JupyterHub
to it.) I only have mic on for these sessions.

**Go Programming (My Own Stuff)** is me keeping up with Go programming
(which my current job doesn't officially require even though I could
probably make a lot more money as a full-time Go developer). Use it or
lose it, they say. I'll be working on libraries that are needed for the
(eventual) `mim zet` port to Go, CmdBox, and my other utilities.
