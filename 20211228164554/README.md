# Twitch Streamer Utility: `iam`

Been polishing up the `iam` bash script I've been using and it occurred
to me that I would actually start logging the modes and even combine
them into a log that displays on the Twitch about page. I've also been
thinking of a way to regularly export the Google calendar stuff in a way
that can be updated as a profile text component instead of using an
extension that doesn't work on mobile. That way people could see quickly
what has happened and what is planned at one glance.
