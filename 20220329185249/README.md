# More Evidence Go is a Favorite for Hackers

In 2021 there was a massive increase in malware written in Go. People
are taking old C code hacks, wrapping them in Go, and redeploying (which
just shows how fucking stupid most security software actually is). And
now we have `garble` to make things even more interesting. There is
absolutely no doubt in my mind --- especially after creating Bonzai for
monoliths of composable command trees and using all of the standard
library stuff for encryption --- that Go will be the dominate
hacker/security language within five years.
