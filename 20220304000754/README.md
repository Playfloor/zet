# Bonzai is Become What I Have Always Wanted

When you are an operations engineer (or a hacker) and are constantly
putting out fires (or starting them) you need to make high-quality code
very quickly. The term "rapid applications development" seems not only
too formal, but just fucking stupid when you try to describe the demands
of a full-time hacker/engineer. That's why mastering vi/m and bash
scripting is so very critical.
