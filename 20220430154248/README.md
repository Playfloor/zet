# Bonzai Shell will be `bonsh.Cmd`

I do like the name `bonsh`. That will be the command that starts an
interactive REPL or just processes all of its arguments as a single line
of bonsh shell code.

* `--` - pipe operator
* `\r?\n` - end of command

```bonzai
  produce output with lines
  --
  each line
  foo the line
  --
  prefix someprefix
```

    #bonzai #shell
