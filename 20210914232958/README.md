# What is your opinion of NFTs?

1. An NFT associates a digital asset with a token
1. Tokens are *usually* through block chain ("coin")
1. NFTs are all about scarcity and uniqueness
1. I think scarcity is fine for collectors
1. It's a good idea to provide scarcity for digital
1. Think about the thing that have been created digital
1. Artificial scarcity is fine 
1. I *don't* like promoting a "coin" as dependency for NFTs
1. My favorite (so far) is "unique" Git commits
